    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid): This is an epoxidation reaction. The addition of the oxygen atom is a *syn-addition*. Since the starting alkene is planar and achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n        *   Attack on the trans-alkene yields a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+): This causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This ring-opening proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, resulting in *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The rule for anti-addition to a trans-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\   /\n                  C=C\n                 /   \\\n                H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same two-step sequence for anti-dihydroxylation is used.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The rule for anti-addition to a cis-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's identify the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Separations**\n\n**A) Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical and chemical properties (like polarity, size, etc.).\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. The racemic pair of (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with the two enantiomers.\n*   Enantiomers can be separated by a chiral column because their transient interactions with the chiral stationary phase form diastereomeric complexes with different energies, leading to different retention times. Thus, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate, third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
