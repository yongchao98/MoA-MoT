    "Here's my thinking process to solve this special relativity problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   I need to find the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   There are two reference frames:\n        *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame (considered \"stationary\").\n        *   Frame S': The ejecta's reference frame (considered \"moving\").\n    *   I am given the following information:\n        *   The relative velocity (`v`) between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.\n        *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`) is 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the moving frame's own clock.\n    *   The goal is to find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame (Frame S).\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principles:**\n    *   This is a classic special relativity problem involving time dilation.\n    *   The core concept is that time passes at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference that are moving relative to each other. An observer in a stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (ejecta) than the moving object measures for itself. The formula for this is time dilation.\n    *   Once I find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`), I can use the standard formula for distance: `distance = speed × time`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Define the constants and given values.\n        *   `v = 60,000` km/s\n        *   `c` (speed of light) `= 300,000` km/s\n        *   `Δt'` (proper time in ejecta's frame) `= 50` s\n    *   **Step 2:** Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`), which is the factor by which time is dilated. The formula is:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   **Step 3:** Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`) using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   **Step 4:** Calculate the distance (`d`) traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation (and use code for precision):**\n    *   I can combine the formulas from Step 3 and 4: `d = v * (γ * Δt')`.\n    *   This is `d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`.\n    *   I'll write a simple Python script to compute this accurately to avoid manual calculation errors, especially with the square root.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s (time in the ejecta's frame)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# First, calculate the ratio (v/c)^2\nv_over_c_squared = (v / c)**2\n# Now, calculate gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d)\ndistance = v * dt\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(distance)\n```\n\n5.  **Review the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The code will output the calculated distance in kilometers.\n    *   I will then compare this result to the multiple-choice options provided.\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km\n        D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculation `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)` gives approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to option B, differing only by about 0.06%. The options are likely rounded, making B the correct choice. The script will confirm the precise value. After running the code, I will format the final answer.\n\nThe final computed value will be approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this to the options, 3,060,000 km (Option B) is the closest answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify Reference Frames:** We have two inertial reference frames.\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame: The Galaxy's reference frame. Let's call its time `Δt` and distance `d`.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame: The supernova ejecta's reference frame. Let's call its time `Δt'`.\n\n2.  **List Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between frames, `v = 60,000` km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50` s. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000` km/s.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of the Galaxy (stationary frame), time on the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. We need to find out how much time, `Δt`, has passed in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\n    Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we use the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   This gives `Δt ≈ 51.03` seconds. This means that while 50 seconds passed on the ejecta's clock, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measured 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance traveled by the ejecta *as measured in the Galaxy's frame* is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed *in the Galaxy's frame*.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nTo get a precise value, a calculation is performed.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\n\n# Combined formula for distance\n# d = v * (gamma * dt_prime) = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)) * dt_prime\ndistance = (v * dt_prime) / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\nThe execution of the code provided the output `3061862.178478973`.\n\nThis value, `3,061,862.18` km, is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of special relativity, dealing with the concept of time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   There are two inertial frames of reference: The Galaxy's frame (we'll call it `S`) and the ejecta's frame (we'll call it `S'`).\n*   Frame `S'` (the ejecta) is moving relative to frame `S` (the Galaxy) with a velocity `v`.\n*   We are given the velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   We are given a time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (`S'`): `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest in the moving frame.\n*   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame (`S`). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n**2. The Physics: Time Dilation**\n\n*   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (`S`) will see time pass more slowly for a moving frame (`S'`). The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time `Δt'` that passes in the ejecta's frame.\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, and `c` is the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`).\n\n**3. The Calculation Steps**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nFirst, let's find the ratio `(v/c)²`:\n*   `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\nNow, we can calculate `γ`:\n*   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\nNow we use the time dilation formula:\n*   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   `d = v * Δt`\n*   `d = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n*   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n*   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\nThe provided code output confirms this calculation:\n`d ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,940,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance, `3,061,862.18 km`, is extremely close to `3,060,000 km`. The difference is due to rounding in the options.\n\n(Note: Option C, 3,000,000 km, is the classical answer one would get by ignoring relativity (`d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s`). Because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects must be considered.)\n\n<<<B>>>"
