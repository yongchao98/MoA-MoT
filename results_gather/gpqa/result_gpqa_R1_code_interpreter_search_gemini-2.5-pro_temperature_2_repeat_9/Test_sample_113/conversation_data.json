    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (a source of the cyanide nucleophile, CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a classic nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, known as cyanohydrin formation.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to complete the reaction. In the given options, H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous medium, which provides the necessary proton (H⁺) for the protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used to form bisulfite addition products and is not the correct reagent here. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This molecule contains a nitrile functional group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The product has a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, typically with heating. The reaction proceeds by adding water (H₂O) across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond, with a catalyst.\n        *   In acidic conditions (using a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄), the nitrile is hydrolyzed directly to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   In basic conditions (using a strong base like NaOH), the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Since the product is the carboxylic acid directly and water is shown as a reagent, B must be the catalyst. Comparing the options for B:\n        *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and would hydrolyze the nitrile much more slowly and less effectively than a strong acid like HCl.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
