    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2 with magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, it's aligned with a magnetic field `B_i = B ẑ` (in the +Z direction). This means the particle is in an energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_i = -μ ⋅ B_i = -γBS_z`.\n    *   Being \"aligned\" means it's in the lowest energy state, which for a positive `γ` is the spin-up state with respect to the Z-axis. This state is denoted as `|+Z⟩` or `[[1], [0]]` in the `S_z` basis.\n    *   So, the state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+Z⟩`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dynamics for t > 0**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_f = B ŷ` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B_f = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The state `|ψ(0)⟩` is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H` and will evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal**\n    *   We need to find the oscillation frequency of the *average* (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   This means we need to calculate how `⟨S_z(t)⟩` evolves in time.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenstates (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   The most straightforward way is to find the energy splitting caused by the new Hamiltonian. The oscillation frequency of the system between two states is given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`. The operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of `H` are therefore:\n        *   `E_+ = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_- = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (the energy gap) between these two levels is:\n        *   `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency `ω` is given by the relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n        *   `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    *   This frequency `ω` is the Larmor frequency. Any observable whose operator is not diagonal in the energy eigenbasis will oscillate at this frequency. `S_z` is not diagonal in the eigenbasis of `S_y`, so `⟨S_z(t)⟩` will oscillate with frequency `γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Full State Vector Evolution (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   Let's explicitly calculate the state `|ψ(t)⟩` and then `⟨S_z(t)⟩`.\n    *   The operator `S_y` is given by the Pauli matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ)`.\n    *   We can write this as `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = I cos(θ) + iσ_k sin(θ)`, with `k=y` and `θ = γBt/2`:\n        *   `U(t) = I cos(γBt/2) + iσ_y sin(γBt/2)`\n        *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`. This represents a rotation about the Y-axis.\n    *   The initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+Z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n    *   The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩`:\n        *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n        *   In bra-ket notation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2) |+Z⟩ - sin(γBt/2) |-Z⟩`.\n    *   Now we compute the expectation value `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`:\n        *   `S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ - (-ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩ = (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩)`.\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)⟨+Z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-Z|) * (ħ/2)(cos(γBt/2)|+Z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-Z⟩)`.\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos^2(γBt/2) - sin^2(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ)`, we get:\n        *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expression `cos(γBt)` oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both methods confirm that the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This is a classic example of Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (`Y`) at the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
