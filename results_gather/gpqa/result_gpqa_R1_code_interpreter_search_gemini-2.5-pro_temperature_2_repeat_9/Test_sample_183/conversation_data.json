    "Here is a breakdown of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The goal is to identify the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1 (strongly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)** at C2 (weakly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at C3 (strongly deactivating, meta-directing).\n\nThe substituents are arranged vicinally (1,2,3 pattern). This complex substitution pattern often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful control of regiochemistry, possibly using blocking groups that are later removed.\n\n### Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)\n\n1.  **Final Step: Etherification.** The ethoxy group is best introduced at the end by a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This reaction is reliable and high-yielding.\n    *   Target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    *   Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   Reagents: NaOH, then EtBr (or a similar ethyl halide/sulfate).\n\n2.  **Making the Phenol Precursor.** The core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The substituents (OH, tBu, NO2) are in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult:\n    *   Nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would not yield the 3-nitro product in high yield, as the powerful -OH group directs nitration to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   Alkylating 3-nitrophenol would likely result in a mixture of isomers, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired 2-tert-butyl isomer.\n\n    A more controlled approach is needed, likely involving blocking groups and substituent manipulation. A plausible, albeit long, synthetic route can be constructed using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a removable directing group.\n\n### Proposed Synthetic Route and Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's devise a valid synthetic pathway and see which option provides the necessary reagents.\n\n**A logical (though complex) synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Nitration:** This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, is major, but the ortho isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, is needed for this specific path. Let's assume we can obtain and use the ortho isomer.\n3.  **Sulfonation:** The t-butyl (o,p) and nitro (m) groups both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position para to the t-butyl group.\n    *   2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Intermediate + Fe/HCl → **4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    *   Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by heating with water/acid.\n    *   Diazonium salt + H3O+/heat → **3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (also known as 2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol).\n7.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this phenol derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the final pattern.\n    *   -OH (at C1 of the phenol) and -tBu (at C2) both direct to C3 and C5. The -SO3H (at C5) also has directing effects. Careful analysis shows that nitration is plausible at C3, which is sterically hindered but ortho to the strongly activating -OH group.\n    *   Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitro-5-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (Error in naming in reasoning - correct product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol**).\n8.  **Desulfonation:** Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Intermediate + H3O+/heat → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. We have successfully made the phenol precursor.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   Phenol precursor + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Matching the Route to the Options\n\nNow let's check which option provides all the necessary reagents for this 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nThis option contains all the reagents required for the sequence described above, although they are listed in a scrambled order.\n    *   (i) for step 1\n    *   (ii) and (ix) for the two nitration steps (2 and 7)\n    *   (iii) for sulfonation (step 3)\n    *   (viii) for reduction (step 4)\n    *   (iv) for diazotization (step 5)\n    *   (v) and (vi) for hydrolysis and desulfonation (steps 6 and 8)\n    *   (vii) for the final etherification (step 9)\n\n*   **Option B:** Starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, which is problematic and doesn't lead to the correct substitution pattern. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence, when analyzed correctly, leads to intermediates that do not result in the desired final product. For instance, the nitration of p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (steps ii and iii) gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which has a meta relationship between the eventual OH and t-butyl groups, which is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce an isomer, 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene, which is not the target molecule. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that contains the full set of reagents needed for a plausible, albeit complex, synthesis of the target compound. The confusing order of reagents in the option is likely intentional.\n\n<<<A>>>"
