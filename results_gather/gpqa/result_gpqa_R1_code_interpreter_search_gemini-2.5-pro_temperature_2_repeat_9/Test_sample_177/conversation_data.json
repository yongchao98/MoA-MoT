    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we use natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In these units, mass and energy have the same dimension, which we denote as $M$. Length and time have the dimension of inverse mass, $M^{-1}$.\n\nThe action, $S$, is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe action must be a dimensionless quantity in natural units. The four-volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$, so its mass dimension is $[d^4x] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\nFor $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\n\nThis condition must hold for every term in the Lagrangian. Thus, for the given interaction term, we have:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors**\n\nTo find the dimension of $\\kappa$, we first need to determine the mass dimensions of the other components in the term: $\\psi$, $\\bar{\\psi}$, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion field, $\\psi$**: The mass dimension of a field is determined by its kinetic term in the standard Lagrangian. The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion-kin}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu)\\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of the partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ is $[ \\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   The mass dimension of the term must be $M^4$: $[\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi] = M^4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $[\\psi]^2 [\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$, which leads to $[\\psi]^2 M^1 = M^4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\psi]$, we get $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$, so $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\bar{\\psi}] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Tensor, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ and the factor $i/2$ are dimensionless, the tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor, $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The mass dimension of the gauge field strength tensor is found from its kinetic term in the Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gauge-kin}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be $M^4$: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   Solving for $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]$, we find $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can put everything together to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$.\n$[\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] (M^{3/2}) (M^0) (M^{3/2}) (M^2) = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] M^{3/2+3/2} M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] M^3 M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n*   If all coupling constants have a **non-negative** mass dimension ($[\\text{coupling}]_M \\geq 0$), the theory is renormalizable. These are further classified as super-renormalizable ($>0$) or strictly renormalizable ($=0$).\n*   If any coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension ($[\\text{coupling}]_M < 0$), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative.\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1 < 0$.\n\nTherefore, the interaction $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is a non-renormalizable interaction, and the theory described by it is not renormalizable. In such theories, infinities that arise in loop calculations cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
