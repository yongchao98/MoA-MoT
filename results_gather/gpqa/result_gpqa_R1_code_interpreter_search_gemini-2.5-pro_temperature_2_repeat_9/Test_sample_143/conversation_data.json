    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$): $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame is subject to relativistic time dilation. It's related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$): $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The particle's velocity can be expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    *   Start with $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for $v$ and $\\tau_{lab}$: $d = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n    *   Substitute the expression for $\\tau_0$: $d = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n\n4.  **Express $\\gamma \\beta$ in terms of Energy and Mass:**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = E_X / m_X$. (Note: We use energy units, so $m_X$ stands for $m_X c^2$).\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. From this, the momentum term is $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}$.\n    *   The momentum is also given by $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$. So, $pc = \\gamma \\beta m_X c^2 = \\gamma \\beta m_X$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $pc$, we get $\\gamma \\beta m_X = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}$.\n    *   Solving for the product $\\gamma \\beta$, we find: $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X}$.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Calculation Formula:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for $\\gamma \\beta$ back into the formula for the decay distance:\n        $d = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n6.  **Plug in the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Production Energy, $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Mass, $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   The physical constant $\\hbar c$ is approximately $0.197327 \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$).\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   To ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Convert Gamma_X to GeV\nGamma_X_GeV = Gamma_X_MeV / 1000.0\n\n# Physical constant h-bar * c\nhbar_c = 0.197327  # GeV * fm\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in femtometers (fm) using the derived formula\n# d = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2) / m) * (hbar*c / Gamma)\nd_fm = (math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2) / m_X) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X_GeV)\n\n# Convert the result from femtometers to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nd_m = d_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{d_m}\")\n```\n\n8.  **Analyze the Result:**\n    *   The script calculates the value of the mean decay distance.\n    *   The output is `4.064483017725949e-15`.\n    *   This result is $4.06448 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n    *   B) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n    *   C) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n    *   D) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n\n    Our calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (~0.025%) can be attributed to using a slightly different rounded value for the constant $\\hbar c$. The other options are incorrect by at least an order of magnitude or a significant percentage.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The mean decay distance, $d$, of a particle in the laboratory frame is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n\n$d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is dilated from its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe proper lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these equations, we get:\n$d = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nSince $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light $c$:\n$d = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThe product $\\gamma \\beta$ can be related to the particle's total energy $E_X$ and mass $m_X$.\nThe Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\nThe momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$.\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\nSolving for $pc$, we get $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\nTherefore, $\\gamma m_X \\beta c = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$, which simplifies to:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the decay distance:\n$d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values, using GeV for energy units, so we can omit the $c^2$ terms.\n*   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   The physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 0.197327 \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (femtometers).\n\nCalculation:\n1.

Calculate $\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\approx 7.909 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n3.  Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} = \\frac{7.909}{1.2} \\approx 6.591$.\n4.
