    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It is an **acetophenone** derivative, meaning it has a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering indicates that if the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group is at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are **meta** to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl)**: Deactivating and **meta**-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo)**: Deactivating (weakly) and **ortho, para**-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Deactivating (strongly) and **meta**-directing.\n\nThe final 1,3,5-pattern is difficult to achieve directly because the bromo group is an ortho, para-director, which conflicts with the meta-positions of the other two groups. This suggests a more complex synthesis, possibly involving a \"place-holder\" group that is later removed or modified. The presence of the deamination sequence `(Fe/HCl; NaNO2/HCl; H3PO2)` in the options is a strong hint that an amino group (derived from a nitro group) is used as a temporary directing group and then removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each sequence of reactions:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** on strongly activated rings like aniline because the nitrogen atom of the amino group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex (-NH2+-AlCl3), which prevents the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination)\nSteps (i) through (iv) simply convert benzene to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be a synthetic route. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product)\n*   iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with strong deactivating groups like -NO2. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis is the only remaining option. Let's trace the reactions carefully:\n*   i) Benzene → **Acetophenone**: Introduces the acetyl group (-COCH3). This is a meta-director.\n*   ii) Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**: The meta-directing acetyl group directs the bromine to the 3-position.\n*   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration. The ring has a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho, para-director (-Br). Their effects conflict. This step produces a mixture of isomers. However, a significant amount of the **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone** isomer is formed, which can be isolated.\n*   iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**: The nitro group at position 4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   v) 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one → Nitration. The new amino group is a very powerful activating, ortho, para-director. It will control the position of the next substitution. Its para position is blocked by the acetyl group, and one ortho position (C3) is blocked by the bromine. Therefore, nitration occurs exclusively at the other ortho position, C5. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   vi) The product from step (v) is treated with NaNO2/HCl. This converts the amino group at C4 into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   vii) The diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2. This is a deamination reaction that removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This sequence, while complex, is chemically sound and leads to the desired target molecule in a controlled way, using a temporary amino group to direct a key substitution before being removed.\n\nTherefore, sequence B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
