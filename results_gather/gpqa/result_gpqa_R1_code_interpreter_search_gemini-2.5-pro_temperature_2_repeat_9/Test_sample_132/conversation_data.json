This is a buffer solution. The equilibrium that governs the pH is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    We can use the equilibrium expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    Substituting the concentrations we calculated:\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.112x10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    Now, we substitute the known values. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the calculated [H⁺]. This is a valid approximation because Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ will actually dissociate further.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.112x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.234x10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated concentration is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = (mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4) / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = (mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o) / volume\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_concentration = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3)\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\npo4_3minus_concentration = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / h_plus_concentration\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_concentration:.3e}\")\n```\n[execution results]\n6.234e-07\n[end of execution results]\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.234x10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
