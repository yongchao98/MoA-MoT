    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, which is a formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Principles:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Energy-Time):** This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (also called the natural linewidth or energy width).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π). Its value is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolving Energy Levels:** For two distinct energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly \"resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be significantly greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths).\n    Condition: |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)\n\n**2. Calculation:**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state using its lifetime (Δt). We can approximate the uncertainty principle as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt for an order-of-magnitude calculation.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Uncertainty (ΔE1) ≈ ħ / Δt1\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Uncertainty (ΔE2) ≈ ħ / Δt2\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Applying the Resolution Condition:**\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to distinguish these levels should be greater than the sum of their widths:\nRequired Energy Difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nRequired Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired Energy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two levels must be larger than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The broadening is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1).\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's compare the required energy difference with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much to be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The energy levels would be clearly distinct.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for a clear resolution of the two quantum states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes in seconds\nlifetime1 = 1e-9\nlifetime2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state\n# using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime2\n\n# For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference\n# between them must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this requirement with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 1e-8 eV is NOT sufficient as it is less than {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"B) 1e-4 eV IS sufficient as it is much greater than {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"C) 1e-11 eV is NOT sufficient as it is less than {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"D) 1e-9 eV is NOT sufficient as it is less than {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Underlying Physics Principle**\n\nThe question asks about distinguishing two energy levels, E1 and E2, which have finite lifetimes. A finite lifetime for a quantum state implies an inherent uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the natural linewidth or energy width).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is h / (2π). Its value is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor calculation purposes, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. This gives us the order of magnitude for the energy uncertainty.\n\n**2. Define the Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\"**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their central energies (|E2 - E1|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (widths). The broader the energy levels, the harder they are to tell apart.\n\nThe condition is:\n|E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)\n\nEssentially, the separation between the peaks must be greater than their combined spread.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt1) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Uncertainty (ΔE1) ≈ ħ / Δt1\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt2) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Uncertainty (ΔE2) ≈ ħ / Δt2\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNotice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has a larger energy uncertainty. This is the dominant factor in determining if the levels can be resolved.\n\n**4. Determine the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nNow, apply the condition for resolution:\nMinimum required energy difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nMinimum required energy difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nMinimum required energy difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\nMinimum required energy difference > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, for the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check each option against our calculated requirement (> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV):\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. **This is resolvable.**\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy separation to clearly distinguish the two states, considering their lifetime-induced energy broadening, is 10⁻⁴ eV. The Python code output has also confirmed this reasoning and calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
