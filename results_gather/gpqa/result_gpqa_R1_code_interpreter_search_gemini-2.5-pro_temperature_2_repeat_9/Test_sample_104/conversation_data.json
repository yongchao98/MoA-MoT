    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that creates a transit signal with the same amplitude as the signal from a rotating, spotted star.\n    *   **Scenario 1: Spotted Star**\n        *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n        *   Spots are 1000 K cooler, so spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K`.\n        *   One hemisphere is spotted with a filling factor `f_spot = 20% = 0.20`. This means when this hemisphere faces us, 20% of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n        *   The star's rotation causes a variation in brightness. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces us, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces us.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Transiting Exoplanet**\n        *   The star is unspotted (uniform temperature of 6000 K).\n        *   A planet with radius `R_pl` transits the star with radius `R_star`.\n        *   This transit causes a dip in the star's brightness.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spotted Star Signal:**\n    *   The flux (F) from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_eff`. Let's normalize the flux from an unspotted star to 1. So, `F_max` corresponds to a surface emitting purely at `T_eff`. We can write `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The visible disk is a mix: a fraction `(1 - f_spot)` of the area has temperature `T_eff`, and a fraction `f_spot` has temperature `T_spot`.\n        *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   **Signal Amplitude:** The amplitude of the variation is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum.\n        *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n        *   Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n        *   Simplifying the numerator: `T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴ = f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n        *   So, Amplitude = `[f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴`\n        *   Which simplifies to: `Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Exoplanet Transit Signal:**\n    *   The depth of a transit (the signal amplitude) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, as this is the fraction of light blocked.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem requires the amplitudes to be the same: `Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet`.\n    *   `f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n    *   To find the relative radius, we take the square root of both sides:\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   I will use Python to compute the final value accurately. The code will substitute the known values into the equation derived in step 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf_spot = 0.20    # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to the spots.\n# Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The amplitude of a transiting exoplanet signal is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spot\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the problem is to find the size of a hypothetical planet (`R_pl`) that would block the same amount of light as the dimming effect caused by a large, cool spot rotating into view on a star. We need to express this as a ratio: `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n2.  **Model the Spot-Induced Dimming:**\n    *   The brightness (or flux, `F`) of a star is related to its temperature (`T`) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where `F ∝ T⁴`.\n    *   When the \"clean\" hemisphere is facing us, the star is at its maximum brightness (`F_max`). We can say `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`, where `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star is at its minimum brightness (`F_min`). This hemisphere has 20% of its area (`f_spot = 0.2`) covered by cool spots and 80% at the normal temperature.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The minimum flux is a weighted average of the flux from the normal and spotted areas: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the fractional drop from maximum to minimum:\n        `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n        `Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spot = [f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n3.  **Model the Planet-Induced Dimming (Transit):**\n    *   When a planet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the two signal amplitudes must be equal: `Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet`.\n    *   `f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n    *   To find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of the expression for the spot amplitude:\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value:**\n    *   Plugging in the given values:\n        `T_eff = 6000 K`\n        `T_spot = 5000 K`\n        `f_spot = 0.20`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 0.32.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nThe Python code executed previously confirmed this calculation, yielding `0.32179...`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
