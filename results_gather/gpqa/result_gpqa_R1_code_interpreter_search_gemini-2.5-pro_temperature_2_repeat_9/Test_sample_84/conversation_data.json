    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) R_{star}^2}{4a^2} \\right)^{1/4} = T_{star} (1 - A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states several conditions that simplify this equation:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and will cancel out.\n    *   Both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)$ term will cancel out.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This means we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity (RV) to Orbital Parameters:** The semi-major axis 'a' is not given directly, but we have information from the radial velocity method (Doppler shifts). The Doppler shift allows us to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by each planet.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Star's Velocity (K):** The Doppler effect formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{radial}}{c}$\n    Here, the maximum shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ corresponds to the star's maximum radial velocity, which is the semi-amplitude K.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    We don't need the actual value of K, only the ratio $K_1/K_2$:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n7.  **Connect K to the Semi-major Axis (a):** For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem, eccentricity e=0) and assuming the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ (which is a requirement for observing transits), the stellar velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis (a) by the following formula:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p$ (from conservation of momentum, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity).\n    And the planet's orbital velocity is $v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$ (assuming $M_p \\ll M_{star}$).\n    Substituting $v_p$ into the equation for K:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n    Now, solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    The constants G and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Combine the Formulas:** We found earlier that $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$ and $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. Let's substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    Now substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Notice that the star's properties ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$) and the planets' radii were not needed for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n10. **Perform the Final Calculation:** Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    To get the decimal value, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nM_p1_ratio = 7  # Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nM_p2_ratio = 5  # Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # RV shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # RV shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2_ratio / M_p1_ratio\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nlambda_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios\nT_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_ratio\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equation for the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) R_{star}^2}{4a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1 - A_1) R_{star}^2}{4a_1^2} \\right)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1 - A_2) R_{star}^2}{4a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1^2)^{1/4}}{(1/a_2^2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(a_2^2)^{1/4}}{(a_1^2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{a_2^{1/2}}{a_1^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star in a circular orbit (e=0) is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and i is the orbital inclination. Since transits are observed for both planets, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nFrom the formula above, we can solve for a:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_{star})} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K), i.e., $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
