    "*   **Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr)**\n    *   **Reactants**: The starting material is `trans-cinnamaldehyde`, which is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Its chemical structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It has a benzene ring connected to a propenal chain. `Methylmagnesium bromide` (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent.\n    *   **Reaction Type**: Grignard reagents are strong nucleophiles. In reactions with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, they typically undergo a 1,2-addition, meaning the nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Product 1**: The attack on the carbonyl carbon breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate. A subsequent acidic or aqueous workup (which is implied) protonates the oxygen, resulting in a secondary alcohol.\n        *   Structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO (9 carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring + 3 in the side chain).\n        *   The methyl group from CH₃MgBr adds to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   Structure of Product 1: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol).\n    *   **Carbon Count**: Product 1 has one more carbon atom than trans-cinnamaldehyde. So, 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Reactant**: Product 1, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃, is a secondary allylic alcohol.\n    *   **Reagent**: Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. It is known for its selectivity, typically not affecting double bonds or other sensitive groups.\n    *   **Product 2**: PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n        *   Structure of Product 2: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzylideneacetone).\n    *   **Carbon Count**: This is an oxidation reaction, so no carbon atoms are added or removed. Product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   **Reactant**: Product 2, C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃, is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reagent**: `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane`, more commonly known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, is a sulfur ylide. Its formula is (CH₃)₂S(=O)CH₂.\n    *   **Reaction Type**: The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones via conjugate addition (a Michael addition). The nucleophilic methylene group (CH₂) from the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the C=C double bond. This is followed by an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction where the resulting enolate displaces the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group, forming a cyclopropane ring across the former C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product 3**: A CH₂ group is added to the molecule, forming a three-membered ring.\n        *   Structure of Product 3: The C=C double bond in Product 2 is replaced by a cyclopropane ring. The product is 2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane.\n    *   **Carbon Count**: Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from its CH₂ group) to the structure. Therefore, the final product, Product 3, will have 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nLet's summarize the carbon count through the steps:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons (no change)\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThus, there are 11 carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
