    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: D + B -> H**\n    *   Gas B and Gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n    *   Many solvents exist, but forming one from two common gases in a 1:1 ratio is a strong clue.\n    *   Consider the reaction of carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂), both of which are gases.\n    *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g)\n    *   The product is phosgene (COCl₂). Phosgene is a gas at room temperature (boiling point 8.2 °C), but it can be condensed and used as a solvent in certain chemical applications. This is a plausible identity for H.\n    *   Let's hypothesize: **B = Cl₂**, **D = CO**, and **H = COCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: Hydrolysis of C**\n    *   C reacts with water to reform solid A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).\n    *   C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Since C is formed from A and B (Cl₂), C must be a chloride of A, let's denote it as AClₙ.\n    *   The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid. So, let's set **F = HCl**.\n    *   The reaction also produces a weak acid, G. For this to happen alongside HCl, a disproportionation of chlorine must occur, where some chlorine atoms are oxidized. The simplest oxidized chlorine species forming a weak acid is hypochlorous acid (HOCl). So, let's set **G = HOCl**.\n    *   The overall hydrolysis reaction would be: AClₙ + water -> A + HCl + HOCl.\n    *   For this to happen, the element A in AClₙ must act as an oxidizing agent, strong enough to oxidize some Cl⁻ ions to Cl⁺¹ (in HOCl), while A itself gets reduced back to its elemental form (A⁰).\n    *   The balanced redox reaction is: `AClₙ + (n/2)H₂O -> A + (n/2)HCl + (n/2)HOCl`.\n    *   This requires a metal A with a high reduction potential in its +n oxidation state. E⁰(Aⁿ⁺/A) must be greater than E⁰(HOCl/Cl⁻) ≈ 1.49 V. Gold (Au) fits this description, with E⁰(Au³⁺/Au) = 1.50 V.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: Formation of C**\n    *   Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form bright red product C.\n    *   Let's test our hypothesis that **A = Au** (Gold). Gold is a solid.\n    *   Gold reacts with chlorine gas to form gold(III) chloride, AuCl₃.\n    *   `2Au(s) + 3Cl₂(g) -> 2AuCl₃(s)`\n    *   Solid AuCl₃ is known to be a **bright red** crystalline solid. So, **C = AuCl₃** is a very strong candidate.\n    *   The stoichiometry \"8 equivalents\" is problematic as the reaction `Au + 1.5 Cl₂ -> AuCl₃` does not use 8 equivalents. However, given how well all other clues fit, this may be a distractor or refer to a more complex process. The identities of the compounds seem otherwise secure.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: Formation of E**\n    *   Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   Based on our assignments: C = AuCl₃, D = CO.\n    *   Reaction: `AuCl₃ + 2CO -> E`\n    *   The reaction of gold(III) chloride and carbon monoxide is known to produce gold(I) carbonyl chloride and phosgene: `AuCl₃ + 2CO -> Au(CO)Cl + COCl₂`.\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is an **extremely hazardous** substance (it was used as a chemical weapon). This perfectly matches the description of E.\n    *   So, **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n\n5.  **Summary of Identities**\n    *   A = Au (Gold)\n    *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   C = AuCl₃ (Gold(III) chloride)\n    *   D = CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n    *   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   G = HOCl (Hypochlorous acid)\n    *   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n    *   The molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n    *   Its Lewis structure shows a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, the three electron domains around the central carbon atom arrange themselves in a trigonal planar geometry. The molecule is planar.\n        ```\n           O\n           ||\n           C\n          / \\\n         Cl Cl\n        ```\n    *   To find the point group, we identify the symmetry elements:\n        *   **Identity (E)**: Present in all molecules.\n        *   **Principal Axis (C₂)**: There is a two-fold rotation axis (C₂) passing through the C=O double bond. Rotating by 180° leaves the C and O atoms unchanged while swapping the two Cl atoms.\n        *   **Mirror Planes (σᵥ)**: There are two vertical mirror planes that contain the C₂ axis.\n            1.  One plane (σᵥ) is the plane of the molecule itself (the yz-plane, if C₂ is the z-axis).\n            2.  The other plane (σᵥ') is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle (the xz-plane).\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. Other common C₂ᵥ molecules include water (H₂O) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n\n7.  **Match with Options**\n    *   A) D∞h: Incorrect. For linear molecules with a center of inversion (e.g., CO₂).\n    *   B) D₄h: Incorrect. For square planar molecules (e.g., XeF₄).\n    *   C) C₂ᵥ: Correct. Fits the symmetry of the trigonal planar COCl₂ molecule.\n    *   D) C₂: Incorrect. COCl₂ has mirror planes, whereas C₂ symmetry does not.\n\n<<<C>>>"
