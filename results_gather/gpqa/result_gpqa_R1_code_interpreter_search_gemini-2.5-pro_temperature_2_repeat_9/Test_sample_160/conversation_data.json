    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam. It represents the average distance an electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision/scattering cross-section (σ). The general form is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In the case of gas molecules colliding with each other, both the projectile and the target are moving. This requires a correction factor of √2 in the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ_gg (gas-gas), is determined by the effective kinetic diameter of the neutral gas molecules. This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision model.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is an electron accelerated to a very high energy (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively stationary gas molecule (its thermal velocity is negligible compared to the electron's speed). Because the targets are effectively stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n    *   The scattering cross-section, let's call it σ_eg (electron-gas), is fundamentally different from σ_gg. An electron is a point charge, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to \"physically hit\" the molecule. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) by passing through the molecule's electron cloud or near its positively charged nucleus.\n    *   This long-range interaction means the effective \"target area\" that an electron sees (σ_eg) is much larger than the physical \"hard-sphere\" size of the molecule (which determines σ_gg).\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We have established a key physical difference: The scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is much larger than the collision cross-section for two molecules hitting each other. So, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. In fact, σ_eg is significantly larger.\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the two equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1 = √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2 = n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_eg is much larger than σ_gg, it is certain that n * σ_eg is greater than √2 * n * σ_gg.\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Since the denominator of λ2 is larger than the denominator of λ1, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability of an electron interacting (scattering) with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding. This is because the electron's charge allows it to interact with the molecule over a much larger effective area (larger scattering cross-section). A higher probability of interaction means the average distance between interactions (the mean free path) will be shorter. Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) will be less than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
