    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - 0 + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\nDoU = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of an ester (R-COO-R'). It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) or a simple ketone conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks), which is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks), which is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment (an ethyl group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield chemical shift for a -CH2- group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom that is part of an ester group (-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Appearance (bs = broad singlet):** A broad signal that does not show clear splitting is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (next to an electron-withdrawing group), and the protons giving the signal at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (next to an electron-donating group).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put the identified fragments together:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) - This is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) - The carbonyl part (-COO-) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe two substituents, -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3, must be attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. The electron-donating -NH2 group will cause the adjacent aromatic protons to appear at a higher field (more shielded, ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group will cause its adjacent protons to appear at a lower field (deshielded, ~8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\nThe resulting structure is: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a CH2 group signal around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (not primary), would have a different IR C=O stretch and N-H signal.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has meta-substitution which would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
