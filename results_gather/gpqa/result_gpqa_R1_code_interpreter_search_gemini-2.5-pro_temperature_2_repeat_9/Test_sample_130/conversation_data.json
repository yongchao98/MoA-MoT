    "**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Anhydride):** We need to identify a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride with specific NMR properties.\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   Let's consider maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) possesses a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This would lead to one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals (one for the C=C carbons and one for the C=O carbons).\n        *   The chemical shifts match perfectly: ¹H protons of maleic anhydride are at ~7.1 ppm, the alkene carbons are at ~137 ppm, and the anhydride carbonyl carbons are at ~165 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the **endo** adduct and the **exo** adduct. These are the major and minor products mentioned. The molecular formula of the adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is consistent with the combination of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n*   **The Spectroscopic Data:** We need to use 2D NOESY NMR to determine the structure of the major product.\n    *   A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   A key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This means this cross-peak represents a spatial proximity that is unique to the major isomer.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Endo vs. Exo Products and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product has a bicyclic core.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the main frame. The two protons from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_fuse**) are now on saturated carbons. Due to a plane of symmetry in both endo and exo products, these two protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. The options suggest this is the signal at **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now on the double bond of the bicyclic system. The plane of symmetry makes them fall into two sets: two methyls are *syn* to the C7 bridge, and two are *anti*. This should give two **6H singlets**. The options provide signals at **~1 ppm** and **~1.7 ppm** for these.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge. Its two protons are diastereotopic and not relevant to the options involving singlets, but are likely the source of the \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\".\n\n*   **Key Spatial Difference:** The crucial difference between the endo and exo products is the orientation of the fused anhydride ring.\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring points 'up', away from the C7 bridge and on the same side as the *syn* face of the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are spatially close to one set of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked 'down', underneath the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_fuse** protons are far from the methyl groups but are close to the bridge protons on C7.\n\n*   **Identifying the Major Product:** The Alder Endo Rule states that the endo product is typically the kinetic major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule can be overridden by strong steric hindrance.\n    *   In this reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. In the endo transition state, the incoming anhydride would clash severely with the methyl groups at positions C2 and C3.\n    *   The exo approach is much less sterically hindered. Due to this overwhelming steric factor, the **exo product is expected to be the major product** (it is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored).\n\n**3. Interpreting the NOESY Data**\n\n*   Since the **Exo adduct is the major product**, the unique cross-peak observed in its spectrum must correspond to the proximity unique to the exo geometry.\n*   As established, the unique proximity in the Exo adduct is between the **H_fuse** protons and the nearby **methyl groups**.\n*   The unique proximity in the minor Endo adduct would be between the **H_fuse** protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n*   The problem states the cross-peak is present in the major product. Therefore, it must be the NOE correlation between the H_fuse protons and a set of methyl protons.\n*   Let's match this to the signals given in the options:\n    *   Signal for H_fuse: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Signal for one of the methyl sets: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (or the one at ~1.0 ppm).\n*   The NOESY cross-peak connects these two signals.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak in the major (Exo) product's NOESY spectrum connects the resonance for the two equivalent protons on the fused ring portion (H_fuse) with the resonance for the six equivalent protons of the nearby methyl group set. Option D describes exactly this correlation.\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** NOE between the two methyl groups. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a bridge proton and H_fuse. This would be characteristic of the minor (Endo) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. Likely present in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** NOE between a methyl group and H_fuse. This is characteristic of the major (Exo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
