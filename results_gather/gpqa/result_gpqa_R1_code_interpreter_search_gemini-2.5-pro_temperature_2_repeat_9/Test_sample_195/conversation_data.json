    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the oscillator is conserved. In a relativistic framework, the total energy consists of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. We must use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy. The total mechanical energy $E_{mech}$ is given by:\n    $E_{mech} = T + U(x)$\n    where $T$ is the relativistic kinetic energy and $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n2.  **Potential and Kinetic Energy**\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law: $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is the work done to displace the mass from the equilibrium position ($x=0$) to a position $x$:\n        $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy $T$ of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is:\n        $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n        where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy at Two Key Points**\n    The total mechanical energy must be the same at every point in the oscillation. We consider two specific points: the point of maximum amplitude and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (turning point):**\n        Here, the displacement is $x = A$. The mass momentarily stops before reversing direction, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        -   At $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        -   The kinetic energy is $T_1 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        -   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        -   The total mechanical energy is $E_{mech} = T_1 + U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position:**\n        Here, the displacement is $x = 0$. The potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        -   At $v=v_{max}$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        -   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $T_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        -   The potential energy is $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        -   The total mechanical energy is $E_{mech} = T_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the turning point must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n    $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, we substitute our expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
