    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone. Let's deconstruct the product name: \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran system) and a ketone (carbonyl group) at the 2-position. When a carbonyl is part of a heterocyclic ring next to the heteroatom, it signifies a lactone (cyclic ester). A six-membered lactone is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **\"tetrahydro\"**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **\"(R)\" or \"(S)\"**: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the carbon at position 4 (the one bearing the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\nCH2(6)   C(2)=O\n |        |\nCH2(5)   CH2(3)\n \\      /\n  CH(4)-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\nReaction A produces the (R)-enantiomer.\nReaction B produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   This name, though not strictly IUPAC compliant, describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Structure of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH. The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (C3).\n*   The starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of this diacid. This means one of the two carboxylic acid groups has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n*   Let's assume the esterification occurred on the carboxylic group further from the ethyl substituent. The structure would be:\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-CH2CH(CH3)2`\n    This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The stereochemistry (R/S) is at the C3 position.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The ester group of starting material A is reduced by LiBH4 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --LiBH4-->  HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, eliminating a water molecule and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the final lactone product (C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone).\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B: Reduction with BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: BH3 (Borane) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group of starting material B is reduced by BH3 to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --BH3-->  HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group, displacing the isobutoxy group (which becomes isobutanol) and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the original stereocenter at C3. C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry is conserved.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
