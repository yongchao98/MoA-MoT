    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In a three-dimensional context, this means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d` where `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds. For our derivation, the constant of proportionality doesn't matter, so we can use `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume of Space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from us. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin spherical shell (`dV`) with radius `d` and thickness `dd` is the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Transforming from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance. So, we need to express our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We have two substitutions to make: one for `d` and one for `dd`.\n    *   From `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute for `d`.\n    *   To substitute for `dd`, we need to find the relationship between the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. When counting the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Deriving the Final Relation:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx⁴\nC) ~ 1/plx²\nD) ~ 1/plx¹\n\nOur derived relationship matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
