    "*   **Analyze the Observations:**\n    1.  **1H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (an alpha-proton). They have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This indicates the proton exists in two slightly different chemical environments.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** At elevated temperature, the sample separates into two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). Both peaks show the same mass spectrum (MS), which matches the expected molecular weight of the synthesized peptide. The peaks have equal intensities, suggesting a 1:1 mixture of the two species.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the product, ruling this out.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This would create a molecule with a different structure and a higher mass (e.g., adding an extra amino acid). The MS data again rules this out as both observed peaks have the expected mass.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent or a standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in either NMR or standard LC. To separate them, chiral conditions (chiral solvent, chiral resolving agent, or chiral chromatography column) are required, none of which are mentioned. Thus, this explanation is inconsistent with the observations.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This happens in molecules with two or more chiral centers when the configuration differs at only some, but not all, of them. For example, during the synthesis of a dipeptide from two L-amino acids (L,L), some racemization at one of the alpha-carbons could lead to the formation of an L,D-dipeptide. The L,L and L,D forms are diastereoisomers.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and exist in distinct chemical environments. It is expected that they will have different NMR spectra. Protons in one diastereoisomer will have slightly different chemical shifts compared to the corresponding protons in the other, leading to duplicated peaks, which is exactly what is observed for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated using standard, achiral chromatography methods like HPLC (the \"LC\" part of LC-MS). This explains the two distinct peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight, which explains why they give identical mass spectra. The \"elevated temperature\" observation is also key; it rules out easily interconverting conformers (like cis/trans isomers around a proline peptide bond, which are also a type of diastereomer called rotamers) that would coalesce into a single peak at higher temperatures. The fact that the peaks remain separate indicates a stable, configurational difference, such as an epimer formed during synthesis.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
