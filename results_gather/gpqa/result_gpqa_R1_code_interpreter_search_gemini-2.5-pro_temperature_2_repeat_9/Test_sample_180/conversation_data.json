    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial and Hypothetical Conditions**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The Sun produces neutrinos from several reactions. The problem focuses on two energy bands: 700-800 keV (Band 1) and 800-900 keV (Band 2). In the standard Sun, the neutrino flux in these bands comes from:\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** (from the pp-III branch) Have a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV, contributing to both bands.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** (from the pp-II branch) Have a strong, mono-energetic line at 862 keV, which falls entirely within Band 2.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** (from the CNO cycle, mainly ¹³N and ¹⁵O) Have continuous spectra up to ~1.7 MeV, contributing to both bands.\n*   **Hypothetical Change:** The pp-III branch stops. This branch is responsible for the reaction `⁷Be + p -> ⁸B + γ`, which leads to the production of ⁸B neutrinos.\n*   **Consequence:** The flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero everywhere. The effect is just now reaching Earth. All other neutrino sources (pp-II, CNO cycle) remain active.\n\n**2. Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Band After the Change**\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The only remaining sources contributing to this energy band are the CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`).\n    *   So, `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)`.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The remaining sources are:\n        1.  The very intense ⁷Be neutrino line at 862 keV.\n        2.  The CNO cycle neutrinos.\n    *   So, `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(862 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)`.\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes**\n\nTo find the ratio, we need to compare the sizes of these flux components. We can use known values from the Standard Solar Model.\n\n*   **Flux of the ⁷Be line:** The total flux of this single line is immense, approximately **Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹**. Since the line is at 862 keV, it contributes its entire flux to Band 2.\n\n*   **Flux of CNO neutrinos:** The total combined flux from the relevant CNO reactions (`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`) is approximately **Φ(CNO, total) ≈ 4.9 x 10⁸ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹**. This total flux is spread across a wide energy range.\n\n*   **Comparing Fluxes in Band 2:** The contribution of CNO neutrinos to Band 2 is only a small fraction of its total flux (`Φ(CNO, total)`). This is completely negligible compared to the massive flux from the ⁷Be line (`Φ(⁷Be)`).\n    *   Therefore, we can make the excellent approximation: **`Flux(Band 2) ≈ Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 4.8 x 10⁹`**.\n\n**4. Estimate the Flux in Band 1 and Calculate the Ratio**\n\n*   Now we need `Flux(Band 1)`, which is the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV range. This is a fraction of the total CNO flux (`Φ(CNO, total)`).\n*   The total CNO flux (`~4.9 x 10⁸`) is about **one-tenth (0.1)** of the ⁷Be line flux (`~4.8 x 10⁹`).\n*   The energy band of 700-800 keV is a 100 keV slice of the total CNO spectrum, which spans up to ~1700 keV. The 700-800 keV range is near the emission peak for ¹⁵O neutrinos, which are a major part of the CNO flux. It is reasonable to approximate that about **10% (or 0.1)** of the total CNO flux falls within this 100 keV band.\n*   So, `Flux(Band 1) ≈ 0.1 * Φ(CNO, total) ≈ 0.1 * (4.9 x 10⁸) = 4.9 x 10⁷`.\n\n*   **Final Ratio Calculation:**\n    `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`\n    `Ratio ≈ (0.1 * Φ(CNO, total)) / Φ(⁷Be)`\n    `Ratio ≈ (4.9 x 10⁷) / (4.8 x 10⁹)`\n    `Ratio ≈ 0.0102`\n\nThis value is approximately **0.01**.\n\nLet's double check this with the two main factors we identified:\n1.  The total CNO flux is about 1/10th of the ⁷Be flux.\n2.  The flux in Band 1 is about 1/10th of the total CNO flux.\n\n`Ratio ≈ (1/10 of CNO flux) / (Be flux) = (1/10) * (CNO flux / Be flux) ≈ (1/10) * (1/10) = 1/100 = 0.01`.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
