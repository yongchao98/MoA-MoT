    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the number of atoms in different energy states is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_j$) in an excited state with energy $E_j$ to the number of atoms ($N_i$) in a lower energy state with energy $E_i$:\n\n    $\\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{(E_j - E_i)}{kT}}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $g_j$ and $g_i$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (approximately $1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_j - E_i$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n\n3.  **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excited\" refers to the population of the higher energy level relative to a lower one (usually the ground state). We can represent this excitation ratio as $R = N_j / N_i$. Since we are observing the same transition for the iron atoms in both stars, the energy levels ($E_j, E_i$) and the statistical weights ($g_j, g_i$) are the same. Let's denote the constant term $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ as $C$.\n\n4.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star 1, with effective temperature $T_1$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $R_1 = C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}$\n    *   For star 2, with effective temperature $T_2$, the excitation ratio is:\n        $R_2 = C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}$\n\n5.  **Use the given information:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    $R_1 = 2 \\cdot R_2$\n\n6.  **Substitute and solve for the temperatures:**\n    $C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot (C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}})$\n\n    The constant $C$ cancels out:\n    $e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}$\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation and take the natural logarithm of both sides. Divide both sides by $e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}$:\n    $\\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}} = 2$\n\n    Using the property of exponents ($e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$):\n    $e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2})} = 2$\n    $e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2$\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $\\ln(e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})}) = \\ln(2)$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} (\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}) = \\ln(2)$\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} (\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}) = \\ln(2)$\n\n7.  **Substitute the numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J\n    *   The Boltzmann constant, $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 1 \\text{ K}$\n\n    The problem is designed so that this factor simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n    $1 \\cdot (\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}) = \\ln(2)$\n    $\\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the options:** This result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
