    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment from a spontaneous fission process, once using relativistic mechanics and once using classical mechanics, and then find the difference between the two results.\n\n### 1.  Information Extraction and Initial Calculations\n\n*   **Initial state:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `P_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final state:** Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Calculating fragment masses:**\n    *   The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the sum: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297,000 MeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297,000 MeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99,000 MeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`.\n\n### 2.  Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\n*   By the conservation of energy, the initial total energy must equal the final total energy.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    `M*c^2 = (m1 + m2)*c^2 + (T1 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1 + m2)*c^2`\n    `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`.\n\n### 3.  Conservation of Momentum\n\n*   The initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    `p1 + p2 = 0` => `p1 = -p2`\n*   This means the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\n### 4.  Kinetic Energy Calculation (Classical)\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   Therefore, `2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n*   Using `m1 = 2*m2`, we get `(2*m2)*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3,000 MeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`.\n\n### 5.  Kinetic Energy Calculation (Relativistic)\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = m*c^2 + T`.\n*   Substituting `E`: `(m*c^2 + T)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this gives: `(m*c^2)^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + T^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy: `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3,000 - T1`. Let's substitute all the known values (in MeV):\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 198,000`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99,000`\n    *   `Q = 3,000`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198,000) = (3,000 - T1)^2 + 2*(3,000 - T1)*(99,000)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396,000*T1 = (9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + T1^2) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396,000*T1 = T1^2 + 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1`\n*   Canceling `T1^2` from both sides:\n    `396,000*T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1`\n*   `396,000*T1 + 204,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n*   `600,000 * T1 = 603,000,000`\n*   `T1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV`.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_relativistic = 1,005 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the results with a quick script:\n```python\n# Values in MeV\nM_c2 = 300000\nm_sum_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = m_sum_c2 / 3\nm1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\nQ = M_c2 - m_sum_c2\n\n# Classical T1\nT1_cl = Q / 3\n\n# Relativistic T1 can be solved from T1 * (2*m_sum_c2 + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2_c2)\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2_c2)) / (2 * m_sum_c2 + 2 * Q)\n\n# Difference\ndifference = T1_rel - T1_cl\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_cl} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_rel} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nClassical T1: 1000.0 MeV\nRelativistic T1: 1005.0 MeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n>>>\n### 6.  Final Answer\n\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value `T1` and the value calculated using the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1.  Identify Given Information and Constants\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2.  Calculate Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nThe Q-value is the total kinetic energy released, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n\n*   **Final rest-mass energy:**\n    `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV`.\n*   **Individual rest-mass energies:**\n    We have two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297,000 MeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)` (since `m1 = 2*m2`)\n    Substituting (2) into (1):\n    `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297,000 MeV`\n    `3*(m2*c^2) = 297,000 MeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99,000 MeV` (rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV` (rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n*   **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`.\n    This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2`.\n\n### 3.  Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2` in magnitude).\n\n*   `p1^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n*   `p2^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   Since `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   `T2_classical = (m1 / m2) * T1_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`.\n\n### 4.  Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`. Again, momentum is conserved (`p1 = p2` in magnitude), so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = 3,000 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198,000 MeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99,000 MeV`. Let's substitute these values:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198,000) = (3,000 - T1)^2 + 2*(3,000 - T1)*(99,000)`\n*   Expanding the terms:\n    `T1^2 + 396,000*T1 = (9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + T1^2) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396,000*T1 = 9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000*T1`\n*   Combine terms:\n    `396,000*T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1`\n*   Move all `T1` terms to one side:\n    `396,000*T1 + 204,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n    `600,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n*   Solve for `T1`:\n    `T1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV`.\n\n### 5.  Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe correct answer is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
