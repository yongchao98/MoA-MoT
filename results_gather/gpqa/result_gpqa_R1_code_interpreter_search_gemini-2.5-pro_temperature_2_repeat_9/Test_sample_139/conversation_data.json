    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B:** Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". 277 K is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Therefore, we can deduce that **B is D₂O (Heavy Water)**.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and its Isotope:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope.\" Since we've identified D₂O, it's highly likely this isotope is Deuterium (D), the heavier isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G:** A precipitate G is formed, and when heated, it releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide, of the form M(OD)ₓ. Heating such a compound would cause it to decompose, releasing D₂O. For example, 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This suggests that the metal M in the hydroxide is Aluminum.\n    *   **Clue 4: The Organic Reaction:** The reaction of X with a keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a powerful reduction reaction that reduces both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). For example, R-C(=O)-COOH would be reduced to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygen atoms. This type of powerful reduction is characteristic of **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Since we know X contains deuterium, the logical conclusion is that **X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The \"very close analog used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" is indeed LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue 5: The Violent Reaction:** Now we put all the pieces together for the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.\n        *   X = LiAlD₄\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (from clue 3, and consistent with Aluminum being in X)\n        *   Let's hypothesize the reaction. To form Al(OD)₃, the reaction needs a source of deuterium and oxygen. X (LiAlD₄) provides the aluminum and some deuterium. To get more deuterium and the oxygen, the liquid Y must be **D₂O (Heavy Water)**.\n        *   Let's write the full reaction: **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)**\n    *   **Clue 6: Verifying Gas W:** The gas W produced in our proposed reaction is D₂ (deuterium gas). The clue states that W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   A Deuterium (D) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This perfectly matches the clue, confirming our entire reaction scheme.\n\n2.  **Identify the Substance and Elements:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1), which is present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number (Z) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of all instances of these elements. We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n        *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**.\n    *   In the formula LiAlD₄:\n        *   There are **4** atoms of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n        *   There is **1** atom of the heaviest element's isotope (Al).\n    *   Sum the masses:\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from D) + (Mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B. To verify the calculation:\n```python\n# Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Li, Al, D.\n# Lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D). Mass number of D = 2.\n# Heaviest element is Aluminum (Al). Mass number of Al = 27.\n# The formula LiAlD4 contains 4 atoms of D and 1 atom of Al.\n\n# Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium)\nmass_from_D = 4 * 2\n\n# Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)\nmass_from_Al = 1 * 27\n\n# Cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = mass_from_D + mass_from_Al\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "An analysis of the problem leads to the following conclusions:\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The melting point of B is stated as being very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is a strong indicator of heavy water, D₂O, whose melting point is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D), the isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Substance X and Organic Reaction**: The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction reaction, characteristic of reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Given that X contains deuterium, the logical conclusion is that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. LiAlD₄ is a close analog to LiAlH₄, which is widely used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Violent Reaction**: The clues describe X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This perfectly matches the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water:\n    *   **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)**\n*   **Verification of Gas W**: The gas released, W, is Deuterium gas (D₂). A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue that the gas molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Verification of Precipitate G**: The precipitate G, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would decompose upon heating to form Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B), fitting the description.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The integer mass number for the most common isotopes will be used for calculation.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element** (by atomic number): Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n*   **Heaviest Element** (by atomic number): Aluminum.\n*   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n*   There are four atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium (²H) is 2.\n    *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Mass from Deuterium) + (Mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
