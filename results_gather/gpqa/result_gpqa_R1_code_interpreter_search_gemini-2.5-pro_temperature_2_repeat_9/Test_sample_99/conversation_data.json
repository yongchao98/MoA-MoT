    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the compounds A through H.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Compound A to Compound B**\n    *   Compound A has the molecular formula C₃H₆. This formula corresponds to either propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) or cyclopropane.\n    *   The reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (Br₂/CCl₄). This is an addition reaction that occurs with alkenes.\n    *   Assuming A is propene, the reaction is:\n        CH₃-CH=CH₂ (Propene, A) + Br₂ --(CCl₄)--> CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br) (1,2-dibromopropane, B)\n    *   So, Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Compound B to Compound C**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (removal of two HBr molecules).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br) (B) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --> CH₃-C≡CH (Propyne, C) + 2 KBr + 2 H₂O\n    *   So, Compound C is propyne.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Compound C to Compound D**\n    *   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes cyclic polymerization of alkynes to form aromatic compounds.\n    *   Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene.\n        3 CH₃-C≡CH (C) --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene, D)\n    *   So, Compound D is mesitylene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Compound D to Compound E**\n    *   Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄), which performs electrophilic aromatic nitration.\n    *   The three methyl groups on mesitylene are activating and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions (positions 2, 4, 6). All these positions are equivalent.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        Mesitylene (D) + conc. HNO₃ + conc. H₂SO₄ --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) + H₂O\n    *   So, Compound E is 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Compound E to Compound F**\n    *   Compound E (a nitro compound) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (F)\n        This compound is also known as 2,4,6-trimethylaniline or mesidine.\n    *   So, Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.\n\n6.  **Step 6: Compound F to Compound G**\n    *   Compound F (an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), typically generated in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl at low temperatures (0-5°C). This is the diazotization reaction.\n    *   The reaction forms a diazonium salt:\n        2,4,6-trimethylaniline (F) + NaNO₂ + 2 HCl --> 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride (G) + NaCl + 2 H₂O\n    *   So, Compound G is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride.\n\n7.  **Step 7: Compound G to Compound H**\n    *   Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt (often with a base or acid catalyst) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride (G) + H₂O --(NaOH, warm)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (H) + N₂ + HCl\n    *   So, Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\nNow we evaluate the given statements:\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are key intermediates in the synthesis of azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2°C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, all nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal (a singlet). Similarly, the three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent, producing another singlet. Thus, its ¹H NMR spectrum shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a distinct color change to violet, purple, blue, or green. A yellow color (the color of the ferric chloride solution itself) indicates a negative test. In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the hydroxyl group is sterically hindered by the two methyl groups at the ortho positions. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with ferric ions. Therefore, H gives a negative ferric chloride test; the solution remains yellow. The statement implies that H produces a yellow color as a positive result, which is not true. The characteristic reaction of phenols does not occur. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
