    "This problem requires the application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula from the theory of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify Frames of Reference\n\n*   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the frame of reference of the stationary observer.\n*   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S, in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n### 2. Identify the Velocities\n\n*   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Lab Frame (S):**\n    This is the velocity of the moving glass as measured by the observer in the lab. Let's call this `v`. The problem states this is `v`.\n    `v` = velocity of the glass.\n\n*   **Velocity of the Light Beam relative to the Glass Frame (S'):**\n    In the frame where the glass is at rest (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium is `c/n`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass is `c/n = 1/n`. Let's call this `u'`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity as positive.\n    `u' = 1/n`.\n\n*   **Velocity of the Light Beam relative to the Lab Frame (S):**\n    This is the quantity we need to find. Let's call it `u`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula\n\nThe relativistic formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the lab frame S.\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame S'.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame S' in the lab frame S.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n### 4. Substitute the Values and Solve\n\nNow, we substitute the values from our problem into the formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo make the expression cleaner, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n`u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option C. This result is famously known as the Fizeau-Fresnel drag effect, which was experimentally verified and provided strong evidence for the theory of special relativity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nOur calculated speed matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
