    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexan-3-one, which is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has a stereocenter at carbon 5 (the carbon bonded to the methoxy group), and its configuration is specified as (S). This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. It will reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The ether linkage at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting material is chiral and enantiomerically pure (at C5), the reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   The original stereocenter (5S) remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetric molecule and is **achiral**.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The use of \"excess\" NaBH4 ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group. A molecule with stereocenters that is superimposable on its mirror image is called a **meso compound**. The mirror image of (2R, 4S) is (2S, 4R), and they are the same, identical molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the reduction of the achiral starting material produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Products in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the peak containing the enantiomers. This gives a **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have significantly different polarities and retention times. Thus, none of the peaks are expected to overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** Same 5 compounds as above.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each, leading to their separation into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   Product 5 (meso compound) is a diastereomer of the others and will also be separated, giving its own **third peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different classes of molecules and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. Therefore, we will observe 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
