    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a system that is symmetric under some symmetry group goes into a vacuum state that is not symmetric. Goldstone's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a new massless scalar particle or excitation appears, known as a Goldstone boson. Let's analyze the options in this context.\n\n1.  **A) Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the underlying physical laws have rotational symmetry (the direction of spin is arbitrary). However, in the ground state, all spins align in a specific direction, thus spontaneously breaking this rotational symmetry. The low-energy excitations from this ground state are spin waves, and their quantized particles are called magnons. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry.\n\n2.  **B) Phonon:** A crystal lattice is a periodic arrangement of atoms. The underlying laws of physics are translationally and rotationally invariant. However, the ground state of the material (the crystal lattice) is not; it only has a discrete translational symmetry. This spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry gives rise to Goldstone bosons, which in this case are the acoustic phonons.\n\n3.  **D) Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics), if we consider the up and down quarks to be massless, the theory has a global chiral symmetry SU(2)L × SU(2)R. The vacuum state of QCD spontaneously breaks this symmetry down to the diagonal subgroup SU(2)V. According to Goldstone's theorem, this should lead to the existence of three massless bosons. The pions (π+, π−, π0) are identified as these particles. Since the up and down quarks have a small, non-zero mass, the chiral symmetry is not exact to begin with. As a result, the pions are not perfectly massless but are very light compared to other hadrons. They are therefore known as \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons\".\n\n4.  **C) Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a type of topological soliton. It is a stable, non-linear, particle-like excitation in a field. While Skyrmions arise in models that often exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (like the Skyrme model which describes nucleons as solitons of a pion field), the Skyrmion itself is not a Goldstone boson. Goldstone bosons are the massless (or low-mass) fluctuations around the vacuum state, while topological solitons like Skyrmions are typically massive, stable configurations whose existence is protected by topology. They are not the quanta of the field oscillations corresponding to the broken symmetry generators.\n\nTherefore, the magnon, phonon, and pion are all (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. The Skyrmion is not.\n\n<<<C>>>"
