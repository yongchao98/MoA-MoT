    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment and Determine Products**\n\nThe mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This implies that no acidic gases like CO₂ were formed during the decomposition. Therefore, the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. It can also react with nitrogen oxides like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all these reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is an inert gas. Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen (as many salts do), the most probable identity for gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and was absorbed by the copper.\n    *   Moles of O in H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass in the original mixture must be nitrogen.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass of H - Mass of O\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Atomic mass of N ≈ 14 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Deduce the Formulas of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total elemental composition is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get simple integers, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nThis means that for every `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B, the total number of atoms corresponds to the formula H₈N₄O₅. We need to split this \"combined formula\" into two plausible salt formulas.\n\nSince they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion.\n*   The H₈N₄ portion strongly suggests two ammonium cations (NH₄⁺), which would account for N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   This leaves a remaining \"anion part\" of N₂O₅, which must be split between two anions with a total charge of 2-.\n*   The common anions of nitrogen and oxygen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   Let's see if they fit: NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = [N₂O₅]²⁻. This is a perfect match for the remaining atoms and the required charge.\n\nTherefore, the two salts must be:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n\n**(Self-Consistency Check):** Let's verify this. If we have n=0.05 moles of each salt (total moles N = n*(2+2) = 4n = 0.2 => n=0.05), the mass would be 0.05*M(NH₄NO₃) + 0.05*M(NH₄NO₂). M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol. Total mass = 0.05 * (80 + 64) = 0.05 * 144 = 7.2 g. This matches perfectly. The decomposition reactions NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O and NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O also produce quantities that exactly match all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>"
