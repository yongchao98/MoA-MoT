    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the quantum state `|alpha>`**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. We can write it as `|alpha> = N * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`, where N is the normalization constant.\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe bra corresponding to `|alpha>` is `<alpha| = N* * [<(up)|(1-i) + <(down)|(2+i)]`.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = |N|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |N|^2 * [ (1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |N|^2 * [ (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) ]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |N|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 7|N|^2`\n\nSince `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, we have `7|N|^2 = 1`, which gives `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n**2. Define the operator `A` and find its eigenvalues and eigenstates**\n\nThe operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this translates to the matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix, `σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ_1 = +hbar/2` and `λ_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ_1*I)v_1 = 0` => `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [c1, c2]^T = 0`\n    This gives `-(hbar/2)c1 + (hbar/2)c2 = 0`, which simplifies to `c1 = c2`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`, which corresponds to `|up> + |down>`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|eigen1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ_2*I)v_2 = 0` => `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [c1, c2]^T = 0`\n    This gives `(hbar/2)c1 + (hbar/2)c2 = 0`, which simplifies to `c1 = -c2`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`, which corresponds to `|up> - |down>`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|eigen2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring a given eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenstate.\n\n*   **Probability `P_1` for eigenvalue `λ_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n    `P_1 = |<eigen1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<eigen1|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n    `<eigen1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]`\n    `<eigen1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P_1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14`\n\n*   **Probability `P_2` for eigenvalue `λ_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n    `P_2 = |<eigen2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<eigen2|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) ]`\n    `<eigen2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]`\n    `<eigen2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P_2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14`\n\nChecking the probabilities: `P_1 + P_2 = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nIn decimal form, `P_1 ≈ 0.643` and `P_2 ≈ 0.357`. These values correspond to `0.64` and `0.36` in the options.\n\n**4. Find the average (expectation) value**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P_1*λ_1 + P_2*λ_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i^2) + (2 + 2i + i + i^2) ]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`, and the average value of the operator `A` is `hbar/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
