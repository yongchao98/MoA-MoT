    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Principle:** The key physical principle at play is **gravitational compression**. For planets with the same composition (i.e., made of the same mix of elements like iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.), a more massive planet will exert a stronger gravitational force on itself. This increased gravity compresses the material in its interior, forcing the atoms closer together and thus increasing the planet's overall average density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but has five times the mass. Due to the principle of gravitational compression, its own immense gravity will squeeze its material much more tightly than Earth's gravity does. Therefore, its average density must be **higher** than Earth's density.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is also made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but has only half the mass. With less mass, the self-gravitational compression will be weaker. Therefore, its average density will be **lower** than Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\nConclusion: The planet described in option (c) will have the highest density of the group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
