    "This problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, a classic example of applying the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system *before* the collision. The energy ($E$) and momentum ($p$) of a particle with rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ are given by:\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\n$p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (mc)^2} = mc\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nLet's set the rest mass of the electron (and positron) as $m_e$ and the speed of light as $c$. We'll calculate everything in terms of $m_e c^2$ for energy and $m_e c$ for momentum. The horizontal axis will be the x-axis.\n\n**Electron:**\n*   Moves from the left (positive x-direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum: $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}$.\n*   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_e = (+ \\sqrt{15} \\, m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**Positron:**\n*   Moves from the right (negative x-direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n*   Momentum: $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}$.\n*   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_p = (- \\sqrt{3} \\, m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n*   Total Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\, m_e c, 0)$.\n\n### 2. Final State: Energy and Momentum\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. Let's call them photon 1 and photon 2.\n*   The problem states they have the same energy: $E_{\\gamma 1} = E_{\\gamma 2} = E_\\gamma$.\n*   From the conservation of energy: $E_{initial} = E_{\\gamma 1} + E_{\\gamma 2} \\implies 6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n*   Therefore, the energy of each photon is $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n*   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p = E/c$. So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum and Angle Calculation\n\nNow we use the conservation of momentum.\n*   The initial momentum is purely in the x-direction. This means the final total momentum must also be purely in the x-direction.\n*   $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final} = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\, m_e c, 0)$.\n*   Let the two photons be emitted at angles $\\theta$ and $-\\phi$ with respect to the x-axis. Since one is \"upper-right\" and the other is \"lower-right\", their y-momenta must cancel out.\n*   Momentum of Photon 1: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$\n*   Momentum of Photon 2: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma 2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\phi), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\phi)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\phi, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\phi)$\n*   Total final momentum in the y-direction: $p_{y, final} = p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta - p_\\gamma \\sin\\phi$.\n*   Since $p_{y, initial} = 0$, we must have $p_\\gamma(\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\phi) = 0$, which implies $\\theta = \\phi$. This makes sense because the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude).\n\nNow, let's look at the x-component of the momentum:\n*   Total final momentum in the x-direction: $p_{x, final} = p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta + p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Equating initial and final x-momentum: $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\, m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n*   We know $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$, so we can substitute that in:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\, m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\, m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$\n*   We can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides and solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n    $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the photons, which is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$. We first find $\\theta$ and then double it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using arccos\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2*theta\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(total_angle_deg)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the angle $2\\theta$ based on the derived expression for $\\cos\\theta$. The output gives us the final answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An electron-positron annihilation converts the mass and kinetic energy of the initial particles into the energy of two photons. We will solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The energy $E$ and momentum $p$ of a particle with rest mass $m_e$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ are given by:\n\n*   $E = \\gamma m_e c^2$\n*   $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (m_e c)^2} = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nWe'll define the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis.\n\n**For the electron:**\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$\n*   Energy, $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   Momentum magnitude, $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{15} \\, m_e c$\n*   Momentum vector, $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} \\, m_e c, 0)$\n\n**For the positron:**\n*   It moves from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction.\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$\n*   Energy, $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$\n*   Momentum magnitude, $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{3} \\, m_e c$\n*   Momentum vector, $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} \\, m_e c, 0)$\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   **Total Energy:** $E_{total} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n*   **Total Momentum:** $\\vec{p}_{total} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$\n\n### 2. Final State: Photon Energy and Momentum\n\nThe initial system annihilates into two photons.\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The total energy of the two photons must equal the total initial energy: $E_{\\text{photons}} = E_{total} = 6 m_e c^2$.\n*   The problem states both photons have the same energy. Let the energy of one photon be $E_\\gamma$.\n*   $2 E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\n**Photon Momentum:**\n*   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p = E/c$.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum and Angle Calculation\n\nNow, we apply the conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the photons must equal the initial total momentum.\n\n*   The initial momentum has only an x-component. This means the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.\n*   Since the photons have the same momentum magnitude ($p_\\gamma$), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the x-axis for their y-momenta to cancel.\n*   Let the angle of the first photon be $\\theta$ and the second be $-\\theta$ with respect to the x-axis.\n\n**Momentum components:**\n*   **Photon 1:** $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma,1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$\n*   **Photon 2:** $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma,2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\theta), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\theta)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$\n\n**Total final momentum:**\n*   **y-component:** $p_{y,final} = p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta - p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta = 0$. This is consistent with the initial condition.\n*   **x-component:** $p_{x,final} = p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta + p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n\nEquating the initial and final x-momenta:\n$p_{x,total} = p_{x,final}$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$\n\nNow, substitute $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n\nSolve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons, which is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\nUsing a calculator:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n$\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe total angle is $2\\theta$:\n$2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$\n\nThe result is approximately 138 degrees, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
