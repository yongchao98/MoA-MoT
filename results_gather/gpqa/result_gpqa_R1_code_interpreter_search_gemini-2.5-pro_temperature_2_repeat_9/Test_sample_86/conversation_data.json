    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached (C₆H₄R₁R₂). A benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: A carbonyl group is a C=O double bond. This must be part of one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one substituent is a halogen atom, let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   A group with 2 carbons and a C=O group is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group. The general structure is haloacetophenone.\n    *   Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are three possible isomers:\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution)**\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution)**\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution)**\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum will show signals for the aromatic protons (on the ring) and the methyl protons (-CH₃) of the acetyl group.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet (s)**, typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm. This will be common to all three isomers.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** This is the key to distinguishing the isomers.\n        *   **Para isomer (1,4-disubstituted):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H**. One doublet will be for the protons next to the acetyl group, and the other for the protons next to the halogen. These signals typically appear between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n        *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) isomers:** These molecules lack symmetry. All four aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent. This results in a much more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, typically with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, triplets of doublets), not two simple doublets of 2H intensity.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Predictions:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)` - This is two doublets, each for two protons. This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for the **para isomer**. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons adjacent to it are shifted furthest downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)` - This is a singlet for three protons, matching the methyl of an acetyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This spectrum does not correspond to the described compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   A signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts the structure we deduced.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option B, this lacks the signals in the aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is not the correct spectrum.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes the 1H NMR spectrum that would be produced by the compound described in the question, which is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
