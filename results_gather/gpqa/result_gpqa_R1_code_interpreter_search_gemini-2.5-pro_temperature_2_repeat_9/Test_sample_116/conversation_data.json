    "**1. Reasoning and Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. It consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called atropisomerism (a form of axial chirality). This occurs when bulky groups on the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings restrict free rotation around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   Furthermore, for the molecule to be chiral, there must be no plane of symmetry. Since the substituents on each ring are different at the ortho positions (a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry make the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups attached to the second carbon atom are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone has the formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** We look for any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the central carbon and oxygen atoms and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the H atoms are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** We look for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It exhibits geometric isomerism with its *cis* counterpart, dimethyl maleate, but not optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
