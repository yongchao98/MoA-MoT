    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$). So, $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem states that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in three dimensions is given in spherical coordinates by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means:\n$n_y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$\nFor an arbitrary direction in the plane (not just along the z-axis where $\\sin\\theta=0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi=0$, which implies $\\phi=0$ (or $\\pi$). Let's define the angle $\\theta$ as the angle from the positive z-axis towards the positive x-axis. Thus, we choose $\\phi=0$.\n\nThe unit direction vector is therefore:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator representing the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n\nCombine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n(1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n(2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta$\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we use trigonometric half-angle identities:\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$b (2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nAssuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$. We can express the eigenvector as being proportional to a simpler form. If we choose $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some constant $C$, then $b = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its inner product with itself is 1. For a column vector, this means $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest phase factor, $C=1$.\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. Eigenvector components are dimensionless complex numbers. The factor $\\hbar$ gives them physical units.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Correct. This matches our derived result.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect for the same reason as A and also improperly normalized.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. These are the components of the classical direction vector $\\vec{n}$, not the quantum spinor state. Spin-1/2 eigenvectors depend on half-angles ($\\theta/2$).\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
