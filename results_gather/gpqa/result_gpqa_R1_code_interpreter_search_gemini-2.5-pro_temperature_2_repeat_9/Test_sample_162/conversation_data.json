    "Solution:\nThe user wants to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n**1. Stoichiometry and Molar Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's write down the dissolution reaction of iron(III) hydroxide, a sparingly soluble base, in an acid (represented by H⁺):\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, all of it must be converted into Fe³⁺ ions. We need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   M(Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   M(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   M(H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass (M) = 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   n = mass / Molar Mass\n    *   n = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺ in the Final Solution:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n**2. Equilibrium and pH Calculation**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is an equilibrium process governed by its solubility product constant, Ksp. The solid will be considered fully dissolved when the ion product Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ is just equal to Ksp.\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe value of Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹. We can now calculate the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] that can exist in the solution without Fe(OH)₃ precipitating.\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷ M³\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.680 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.175\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.175 = 1.825\n\nThis pH value does not match any of the options closely, suggesting there might be an issue with the standard Ksp value or the options provided. However, let's proceed with this pH to calculate the required volume of acid.\n\n**3. Calculating the Volume of Acid**\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added from the strong acid are used for two purposes:\n1.  Neutralizing the hydroxide produced from Fe(OH)₃ (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O).\n2.  Establishing the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\nMoles of H⁺ added = (Moles of H⁺ to neutralize) + (Moles of H⁺ for final pH)\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ to neutralize:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ (neutralize) = 3 * n(Fe(OH)₃) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH:**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁸²⁵ M ≈ 0.01496 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (final) = [H⁺] * V_total = 0.01496 M * 0.1 L = 0.001496 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ added:**\n    *   n(H⁺)_total = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + 0.001496 mol = 0.004303 mol\n\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M Acid:**\n    *   Volume = moles / concentration\n    *   V_acid = 0.004303 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04303 L = 43.03 cm³\n\n**4. Re-evaluation based on the provided options**\n\nOur calculated pH (1.825) and volume (43.03 cm³) do not match any of the options. Let's reconsider the problem by testing the given options. We can calculate the total H⁺ required for each pH option and see if it's consistent with the volume.\n\nLet's test Option D: pH = 2.04; V_acid = 28.05 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ provided by the acid:**\n    *   V_acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n    *   n(H⁺)_total_added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\n\n*   **Calculate the moles of H⁺ consumed and remaining in the solution:**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (neutralize) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol (as calculated before)\n    *   If pH = 2.04, then [H⁺]_final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 0.00912 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (final) = [H⁺]_final * V_total = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n\n*   **Sum of consumed and remaining H⁺:**\n    *   n(H⁺)_calculated = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol\n\nNow, let's check the condition for dissolution at pH = 2.04.\n*   If pH = 2.04, then pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ M\n*   Calculate the Ion Product Qsp:\n    *   Qsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * (10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶)³ ≈ 2.22 x 10⁻³⁸\n\nThis Qsp value (2.22 x 10⁻³⁸) is slightly less than the literature Ksp (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹). The fact they are so close (within one order of magnitude) suggests that pH ≈ 2 is the correct range for dissolution, but the values given in the problem likely rely on a slightly different Ksp value or contain a slight inconsistency.\n\nHowever, the moles of acid required (our calculation gave 0.003719 mol) is still quite different from the moles provided in option D (0.002805 mol).\n\nLet's re-examine the moles needed for neutralization: 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol. The moles of acid added in option D is 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol. These two numbers are almost identical. This implies that the problem assumes a simple stoichiometric reaction where nearly all the added acid is used to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃, leaving only a negligible amount to control the final pH. This would mean:\nVolume ≈ (3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃) / (Acid Concentration)\nVolume ≈ (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M ≈ 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. This strongly suggests the problem's intended logic is based on this direct stoichiometric calculation. If we accept this volume, we must then accept the corresponding pH of 2.04. The small discrepancy between the pH calculated from Ksp and the pH given in the option likely arises from using a slightly different Ksp value in the problem's source material.\n\nGiven the close match in the acid volume calculation, Option D is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- Volume needed for neutralization: ~28.07 cm³\n- Option D Volume: 28.05 cm³ (Excellent match)\n- Option D pH: 2.04 (Plausible pH for dissolution, though sensitive to the exact Ksp value used)\n\nTherefore, we conclude Option D is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
