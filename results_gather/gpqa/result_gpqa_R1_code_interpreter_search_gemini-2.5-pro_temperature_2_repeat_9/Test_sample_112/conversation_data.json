    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very strong indicator of an O-H stretching vibration, characteristic of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. An alcohol O-H stretch is also broad but typically appears at a higher wavenumber (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹). The position around 3000 cm⁻¹ is classic for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its presence, along with the O-H peak, further supports the existence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which has a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond in the molecule, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this mass is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. Let's calculate its mass: Mass = (1 × C) + (2 × O) + (1 × H) = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu. The presence of this fragment strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we are highly confident the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This means the molecular formula must contain at least two oxygen atoms. This immediately rules out options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we know the molecule also contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    The formula is: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n\n    *   **From our spectral data:** We have identified a C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond. This means the molecule must have at least **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**.\n            This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It could account for the C=O in a carboxylic acid, but not for the additional C=C double bond. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **D) C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**.\n            This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our findings: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n```python\n# The purpose of this code is to verify the manual calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each potential formula.\n# The DoU helps determine which formula can accommodate the functional groups identified from the spectra (a C=O double bond and a C=C double bond).\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall('([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    atoms = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'N': 0, 'O': 0, 'X': 0}\n    for element, count in parts:\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        if element == 'C':\n            atoms['C'] += count\n        elif element == 'H':\n            atoms['H'] += count\n        elif element == 'N':\nt            atoms['N'] += count\n        elif element in ['F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I']:\n            atoms['X'] += count\n    # Formula: DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    dou = atoms['C'] - atoms['H']/2 - atoms['X']/2 + atoms['N']/2 + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n}\n\n# The spectral data indicates the presence of a C=O double bond and a C=C double bond, requiring a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\nrequired_dou = 2\nprint(f\"Required Degrees of Unsaturation based on spectra: {required_dou}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DoU = {dou}\")\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "My apologies, there was an indentation typo in the generated Python script which caused it to fail. However, the reasoning leading to the conclusion remains valid and can be completed without the script. Let me briefly restate the core logic.\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:**\n    *   FTIR (broad ~3000 cm⁻¹, strong 1700 cm⁻¹) + Mass Spec (m/z=45) strongly indicate a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group. This group contains one C=O double bond. The presence of a -COOH group means the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) + ¹H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) indicate a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n2.  **Required Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A C=O double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **DoU = 2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on DoU:**\n    The formula for DoU (for CxHyOz) is: `DoU = x - (y/2) + 1`\n\n    *   A) C6H12O2: DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. (Incorrect, not enough unsaturation)\n    *   B) C6H12O: Has only one oxygen. (Incorrect, needs two for -COOH)\n    *   C) C6H10O: Has only one oxygen. (Incorrect, needs two for -COOH)\n    *   D) C6H10O2: DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. (Correct, matches the required DoU for a C=O and a C=C bond).\n\nThis calculation confirms that only the formula C6H10O2 fits all the analytical data provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
