    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, θ)$:\n    $V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve when the potential is separable. We can test this by converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The conversion relations are:\n    $x = r \\cos(θ)$\n    $y = r \\sin(θ)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r \\cos(θ))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(θ)$, we have $x^2 = r^2 \\cos^2(θ)$.\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms involving $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n\n4.  **Identify the Separable Nature of the Potential:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    *   $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    *   $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$\n\n    This is the potential for two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), one oscillating along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.\n\n5.  **Determine the Frequencies of the Harmonic Oscillators:**\n    The potential for a standard 1D QHO is given by $V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2$. We can compare this with our potentials $V_x(x)$ and $V_y(y)$ to find the angular frequencies $ω_x$ and $ω_y$.\n\n    *   For the x-direction:\n        $1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2$\n        $1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k$\n        $ω_x^2 = 4k/m$\n        $ω_x = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    *   For the y-direction:\n        $1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2$\n        $1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k$\n        $ω_y^2 = k/m$\n        $ω_y = \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n6.  **Find the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO are $E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω$. Since our system is a sum of two independent QHOs, the total energy is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n    $E_{total} = E_x + E_y$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y$\n\n    Now, substitute the frequencies we found:\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt{k/m}) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ(\\sqrt{k/m})$\n\n7.  **Simplify the Energy Expression:**\n    Factor out the common term $ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$:\n    $E = [(n_x + 1/2) \\cdot 2 + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    Here, $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$ and $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers for the harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, respectively.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
