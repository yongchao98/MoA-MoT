    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The partition function is defined as:\n\nZ = Σ_states * exp(-β * E_state)\n\nwhere the sum is over all possible microstates of the system, E is the energy of a given state, and β = 1/(kT).\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n\nFirst, we need to list all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins, and each can have 2 values (+1 or -1), there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of these 8 states. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). For convenience, let's calculate the term P = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each state. The energy will then be E = -J*P.\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):** All spins are up.\n    P = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n2.  **State (+1, +1, -1):** One spin is down.\n    P = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n    There are 3 states with one spin down: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1). By symmetry, they all have the same energy.\n    Degeneracy g = 3. Energy = J.\n\n3.  **State (+1, -1, -1):** Two spins are down.\n    P = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n    There are 3 states with two spins down: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1). By symmetry, they also have the same energy.\n    Degeneracy g = 3. Energy = J.\n\n4.  **State (-1, -1, -1):** All spins are down.\n    P = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels:\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy corresponds to all states with one spin flipped relative to the others. These are the 3 states with one spin down and the 3 states with two spins down (which is one spin up).\n    The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, as expected.\n\nNow we can write the partition function Z using the formula Z = Σ_levels * g(E) * exp(-βE):\nZ = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
