    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the change:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. A positive charge $+q$ is then introduced into the cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, the presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a surface enclosed entirely within the conducting material and surrounding the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface. This implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ and the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    \n    $q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    $q_{inner} = -q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). The induction of charge $-q$ on the inner surface means that a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This positive charge will move to the outer surface of the conductor. Let the charge on the outer surface be $q_{outer}$.\n    \n    $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since the conductor itself has no net charge)\n    $(-q) + q_{outer} = 0$\n    $q_{outer} = +q$\n    \n    So, a total charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Charge Distribution:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside its bulk material is zero. The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) create a complex electric field. The charges on the outer surface ($+q$) must arrange themselves to completely cancel this field within the conductor's material. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the only way to ensure the field inside the conductor remains zero and the surface remains an equipotential is for the charge $+q$ to distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor shields the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The non-uniformities of the charge distribution inside are canceled out by the induced charges on the inner cavity wall.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface. However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. A more direct way to see this is that the field outside is produced solely by the charges on the outer surface.\n\n    We have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. According to a result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electricity), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is $L$.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2} = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:** The variables related to the cavity's geometry and position ($r$, $s$) and the relative position of point P to the cavity ($l$, $\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n    Let's compare our result with the given options:\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derived result.\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on irrelevant parameters.\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if only the cavity's center hosted charge $q$ without the conductor.\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on irrelevant parameters.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
