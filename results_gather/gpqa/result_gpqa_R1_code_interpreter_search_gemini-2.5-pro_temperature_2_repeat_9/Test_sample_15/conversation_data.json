    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C of CH₃, C of CH₂CH₃) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group or a conformation where one of its H's is in the plane). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes (3aR, 7aS, E) specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The letters 'R' and 'S' are used to denote the absolute configuration at chiral centers. The existence of a name for a specific enantiomer implies that the molecule is chiral and that this particular form can be isolated. A meso compound (an achiral molecule with chiral centers) would not be named as a single R,S-isomer in this manner without it being clear that the molecule as a whole is achiral. The complexity of the structure, involving a bicyclic system and an exocyclic double bond with specified geometry (E), makes the presence of a symmetry element that would render the entire molecule achiral highly unlikely. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are the same as on C3. When a molecule has two identical chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is therefore achiral. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. Since the specific (2R,3R) enantiomer is given, it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH₂-CH= part of the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= part of the ring. Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) usually implies that all three substituents are on the same side of the ring's plane (all-cis configuration).\n    *   **Analysis**: Let's imagine the three -OH groups all pointing \"up\". This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the carbon atom opposite to it (e.g., the plane containing C1, O, H(on O), C4 and H's on C4). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   **Analysis**: We need to search for a chiral center. None of the carbons in the `3-methylbutanoyl` chain [ (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)- ] are chiral. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are also not chiral. For example, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to a hydrogen, the carbonyl group, and two identical `-CH₂-` groups within the ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary**:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
