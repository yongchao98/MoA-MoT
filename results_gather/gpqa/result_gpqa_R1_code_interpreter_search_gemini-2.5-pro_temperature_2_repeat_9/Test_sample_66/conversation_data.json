    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible eigenvalues for $L_{1z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$ (where $m_1$ can be -1, 0, 1) and for $L_{2z}$ are $m_2\\hbar$ (where $m_2$ can be -1, 0, 1).\n\n3.  **Identify the Target State:** We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to a final state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This state is represented in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, or more simply as $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation Law (Shortcut Method):**\n    The total angular momentum operator in the z-direction is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    When we measure the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, their eigenvalues ($m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$) must sum up to the total eigenvalue. This is a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    Therefore, any measurement outcome must satisfy the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    In our case, this means $m_1 + m_2 = -1$.\n\n    The question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Let's check if this outcome is possible by summing the proposed $m_1$ and $m_2$ values:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    This result contradicts the required condition that the sum must be -1 (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$). An event that violates a conservation law is impossible. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\n5.  **Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ after starting from the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    Here, we have $m = -1$, and on the other side, we have $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
