    "This question is asking for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge. Let's derive these potentials from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions\n\n*   `q`: The point charge.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position as a function of time.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The field point (observation point).\n*   `t`: The time of observation.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field observed at `t` was emitted by the charge.\n*   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The time taken for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is `t - t_r`. The distance it travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}`\n*   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`: This is the vector from the source's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the field point `\\vec{r}`. Its magnitude is `d = |\\vec{d}|`. With this notation, the retarded time equation becomes `c(t - t_r) = d`.\n*   `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}`: This is the velocity of the charge evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')`, the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` are given by:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nwhere `t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, we can express the charge and current densities using the Dirac delta function:\n*   `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n*   `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Scalar Potential `V`\n\nSubstituting the charge density for a point charge into the formula for `V`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\nThe integral is complicated because the retarded time `t_r'` inside the delta function's argument `\\vec{s}(t_r')` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`.\n\nA standard result from electromagnetic theory for evaluating this integral gives:\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\frac{q}{|\\vec{d}|(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}`\nwhere `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d`. The denominator factor `(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)` accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source (related to the Doppler effect).\n\nSo, the scalar potential is:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}`\nRearranging this gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option B.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Vector Potential `\\vec{A}`\n\nNow, let's find the vector potential `\\vec{A}`. We substitute the current density into the general formula:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\, \\vec{v}(t_r') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe velocity `\\vec{v}(t_r')` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be taken out of the spatial integral, being evaluated at the specific retarded time `t_r` corresponding to the charge's position `\\vec{s}(t_r)`.\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v}(t_r) \\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'`\n\nThe integral is the same one we just evaluated for the scalar potential.\n`\\int \\frac{q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nTherefore:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\vec{v} (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 V(\\vec{r}, t)) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nUsing the relationship `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)`, we find a simple relation between `\\vec{A}` and `V`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)`\n\nNow, we can substitute our expression for `V` to get the full expression for `\\vec{A}`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's check if this matches the expression for `\\vec{A}` in option B:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nWe can relate the constants using `\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)`:\n`\\frac{\\mu_o qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{(1/\\epsilon_0 c^2) qc}{4\\pi} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c}`\nSo, `\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t)` becomes:\n`\\vec{A}_{B}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\nThis is identical to the expression we derived for `\\vec{A}`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` in option B are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge, consistent with the given notation.\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nLet's briefly check the other options:\n*   A and D use the static potential form `1/r`, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation.\n*   C has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. The correct sign is `-`.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
