    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The formula CnH2n corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reaction:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all the component molecules in both mixture X and mixture Y have the same carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring. If they had different skeletons (e.g., a five-membered ring with a methyl group), hydrogenation would likely produce different products or a mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which are resistant to this reaction).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over heated platinum.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   What is Y2? It must be a C6 compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. It must not decolorize bromine water. A well-known reaction that fits the description of \"disproportionation over platinum\" is the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of cycloalkenes. A common example is the disproportionation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene.\n        `3 C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + 2 C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This suggests that the products in Y could be cyclohexane and benzene. Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y2 = Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Hydrogenation: Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane. This works.\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water: Benzene does *not* decolorize aqueous bromine water under normal conditions, unlike alkenes. This fits.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a catalytic process (heated Pt). This process is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms is conserved between the reactants (X1 + X2) and the products (Y1 + Y2).\n    *   X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n        `(C6H_a) + (C6H_b) → (C6H12) + (C6H6)`\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   So, the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must be 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (they contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds. All compounds are based on a six-membered ring.\n    *   Let's find C6 ring compounds that fit these descriptions:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond (not conjugated). Has 10 hydrogen atoms. It will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Has conjugated double bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Has two non-conjugated (isolated) double bonds. Has 8 hydrogen atoms. It will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Let's see if X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) works.\n        *   Sum of hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n        *   Both are C6 ring compounds.\n        *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated bonds.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X = {C6H10, C6H8} gives only cyclohexane. (C6H10 + H2 → C6H12; C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is `C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. An equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products. This entire scenario is chemically sound and fits all given conditions.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
