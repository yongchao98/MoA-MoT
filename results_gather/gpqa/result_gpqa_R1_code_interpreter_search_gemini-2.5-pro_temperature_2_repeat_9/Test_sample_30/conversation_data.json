    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Toluene with Nitric Acid and Sulfuric Acid**\n\nThis is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) reacts with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-director and an activating group. The nitration of toluene yields a mixture of isomers, primarily ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. In many synthetic sequences, the para isomer is the desired product due to lesser steric hindrance and easier separation. We will assume that Product 1 is the major para-isomer.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene)\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group at opposite (para) positions.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄**\n\nProduct 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes benzylic C-H bonds. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the aromatic ring will be oxidized. While stronger oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize it all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a common outcome with MnO₂ is the oxidation to an aldehyde (-CHO). This is particularly likely given the subsequent reaction step.\n\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -CHO group and a -NO₂ group at para positions.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with Acetone and Aqueous Sodium Hydroxide**\n\nProduct 2 (4-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n1.  The base (OH⁻ from NaOH) deprotonates acetone, which has acidic α-protons, to form an enolate nucleophile (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n2.  4-nitrobenzaldehyde does not have α-protons and acts as the electrophile. The acetone enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  The initial aldol addition product is a β-hydroxy ketone: 4-hydroxy-4-(4-nitrophenyl)butan-2-one.\n4.  Under the reaction conditions (especially with base catalysis), this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system.\n\nThe final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Due to sterics, the more stable E (trans) isomer is predominantly formed.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Structure:** O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nNow we need to determine the point group of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n1.  **Structure and Conformation:** The molecule consists of a 4-nitrophenyl group linked to a but-3-en-2-one chain via a C=C double bond. The presence of multiple sp²-hybridized carbons and extensive conjugation (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C bond, C=O bond) strongly favors a planar conformation for the main skeleton of heavy atoms (all C, N, and O atoms).\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cn):** The molecule is not symmetric enough to have any C₂, C₃, or higher rotation axes. For example, rotating the molecule 180° around any axis will not result in an identical structure due to the asymmetry of the butenone chain (-H on one side of the C=C, -C(O)CH₃ on the other).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. The 4-nitrophenyl group on one end is different from the acetyl group (-COCH₃) on the other.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** If we assume the heavy-atom framework is planar, this plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the framework itself and for the hydrogen atoms attached to the ring and the double bond. The only part that breaks this perfect planar symmetry is the methyl group (-CH₃). In any fixed conformation, its three hydrogen atoms will not all lie in the plane, so a static molecule would technically be asymmetric (C₁ point group). However, in chemical contexts, due to the very low barrier to rotation of the methyl group, its hydrogens are often considered to be \"smeared out\" or time-averaged, giving the group effective cylindrical symmetry. Under this common and reasonable approximation, the methyl group does not break the symmetry of the planar framework. Therefore, the plane containing the heavy atoms of the molecule is a plane of symmetry (σ).\n\n3.  **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) C₂ₕ: Requires C₂, σₕ, and i. Our molecule lacks these.\nB) D₂ₕ: Higher symmetry, also incorrect.\nC) C₃: Requires a C₃ axis. Our molecule lacks this.\nD) Cₛ: Requires a single plane of symmetry. This matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
