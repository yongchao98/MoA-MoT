    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak), which is 32% as intense as the M+ peak. This ~3:1 ratio for M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (35Cl has ~75% abundance, and 37Cl has ~25% abundance).\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak stretching from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimer form.\n*   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and the singlet (s) multiplicity is expected as this proton does not have any adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. This pattern arises because of the symmetry in the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Structure:**\n*   From MS, we know we have one Chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know we have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know these two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**5. Verification and Elimination of Other Options:**\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   Molecular Weight (with 35Cl): (7*12)+(5*1)+(35*1)+(2*16) = 156. **Matches MS.**\n    *   Functional Group: Carboxylic acid. **Matches IR.**\n    *   Substitution Pattern: Para-substituted ring with an acidic proton. **Matches NMR.**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. It would show four unique, complex signals in the aromatic region of the NMR, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride/ester. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a substituted aldehyde. It lacks the characteristic signals of a carboxylic acid (the extremely broad IR peak and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm). The NMR aromatic region would also be more complex.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is unequivocally 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
