    "*   **Analysis of the concept:** \"Regularization at high energies\" is a procedure used in physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), to handle mathematical infinities that arise in calculations. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, typically occur when considering processes at very high energies or, equivalently, at very short distances. Regularization temporarily makes these calculations finite by introducing a parameter, the \"regulator.\" This is followed by renormalization, which absorbs the infinities into the physical constants of the theory, leaving finite, predictive results. The question asks which theory does not have these intrinsic high-energy infinities and therefore does not need this procedure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs in the Standard Model, its calculations are plagued by UV divergences. QCD is a renormalizable theory, which means regularization and renormalization are essential procedures to make meaningful physical predictions. Thus, QCD *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum theory, faces a similar issue with the concept of a point charge. The self-energy of a classical point charge (the energy of the electric field it creates) is infinite. This can be seen as a high-energy/short-distance divergence. To handle this, one might have to \"regularize\" the theory by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread over a tiny volume, but this leads to other theoretical problems. So, even in this classical context, a form of high-energy problem exists.\n\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for string theory is to resolve the problem of infinities that arise in both quantum field theory and general relativity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead tiny, vibrating, one-dimensional strings. The interactions between these extended objects are \"smeared out\" over a small region of spacetime, rather than occurring at a single point. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to UV divergences in QFT. Consequently, scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite without the need for regularization. It is considered a UV-finite theory.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where the procedures of regularization and renormalization were successfully developed and applied to tame the infinities appearing in calculations (e.g., the electron's self-energy and the vacuum polarization). Therefore, QED absolutely *requires* regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the choices, only Superstring Theory is constructed in a way that is intended to be free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences from the outset, thus not requiring the procedure of regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
