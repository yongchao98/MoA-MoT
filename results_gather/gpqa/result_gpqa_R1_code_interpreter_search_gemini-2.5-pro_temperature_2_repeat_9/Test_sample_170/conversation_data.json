    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents on the benzene ring.**\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho-para* director or a *meta* director. This classification determines the primary positions of substitution.\n\n*   **Ortho-para directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally increase the electron density at these positions.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (methyl):** Activating group, ortho-para director.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating group, ortho-para director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Deactivating group, but an ortho-para director due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n\n*   **Meta directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups that withdraw electron density from the ring, especially from the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl):** Deactivating, meta director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (carboxy):** Deactivating, meta director.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the para-isomer yields.**\nThe yield of the para-isomer will be very low for meta directors and significantly higher for ortho-para directors. We can establish a rough order by separating the two groups.\n\n(Meta directors) << (Ortho-para directors)\n\nThis means that substances 4, 2, and 6 will have the lowest para yields, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest. Now, we need to order the substances within each group.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta directors (lowest para yields).**\nThe substances are 4) Nitrobenzene, 2) Ethyl benzoate, and 6) Benzoic acid.\nFor meta directors, the yield of ortho and para isomers is very small. The stronger the deactivating effect of the substituent, the more selectively it directs substitution to the meta position, and consequently, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is stronger than its corresponding ester).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for the most deactivated ring and will increase as the deactivating effect lessens.\nOrder of increasing para-yield:\n**C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**\n\n*   (4) C6H5NO2 yields only ~1% para-isomer.\n*   (6) C6H5COOH yields slightly more, ~2% para-isomer.\n*   (2) C6H5COOC2H5 yields more still, around 4-8% para-isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho-para directors (highest para yields).**\nThe substances are 1) Toluene, 5) Ethylbenzene, and 3) Chlorobenzene.\nFor ortho-para directors, the distribution between the ortho and para isomers depends on a balance of electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the attack of the electrophile at the adjacent ortho positions more effectively. As a result, a higher proportion of the substitution occurs at the sterically more accessible para position for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Para-yield: **C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)** (Approximate para yields are ~66% for toluene vs. ~71% for ethylbenzene).\n\n*   **Comparing alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive effect (-I), they direct ortho-para via their resonance effect (+R). The strong electron-withdrawal of the -Cl group deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with sterics, leads to a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The para-isomer yield for the bromination of chlorobenzene is exceptionally high (~87%). This is significantly higher than for either toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para-yield: **C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-para directors is:\n**C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the groups for the final order.**\nBy combining the ordered lists from both groups, we get the final sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
