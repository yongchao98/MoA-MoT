    "An effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that results in a truncated, non-functional protein. The two most common types of mutations that achieve this are nonsense mutations (introducing a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three). Let's analyze the given mutations to see which one causes such a change early in the gene sequence.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence is `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`.\n    *   The translation starts at the `ATG` codon. Let's establish the reading frame and the corresponding amino acid sequence:\n        *   Codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Amino Acids: `Met (M) Phe (F) Leu (L) Ala (A) Gly (G) Thr (T) ...`\n    *   The goal is to find a mutation that disrupts this sequence as early as possible to ensure the resulting protein is non-functional.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's align it with the intact sequence to find the change:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC...`\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC...`\n    *   The changes are in the second and third codons:\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine). This is a **silent mutation** (synonymous), as the amino acid remains the same.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation** (non-synonymous).\n    *   A missense mutation changes one amino acid. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein could still be partially or even fully functional. Therefore, this is not the most probable option for eliminating the compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's align it:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC...`\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The changes are in the second and third codons:\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine). Again, this is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the ribosome to stop translation.\n    *   Since this stop codon appears very early (at the 3rd codon position), the resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). Such a severely truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for knocking out the gene's function.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's align it with the intact sequence. The alignment is complex, suggesting more than a simple substitution. Comparing the start:\n        *   Intact: `ATGTTT C TCG...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATGTTT T ACG...`\n    *   There appears to be a `C` to `T` substitution at position 7, followed by an insertion. This is likely a frameshift mutation, but there are multiple changes. Regardless, this also has the potential to knock out the gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a more direct and certain path to a non-functional truncated protein. For the purposes of a multiple-choice question, the premature stop codon is the most clear-cut answer for gene inactivation.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's align it with the intact sequence. Let's find the difference:\n        *   Intact:  `...CTCGCTGGTA...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `...TACGCTACTA...`\n    *   Looking closely, the change is `GGT` (Glycine, codon 5) to `ACT` (Threonine, codon 5 in the new frame) and `ACT` (Threonine, codon 6) to `TAC` (Tyrosine, codon 6 in the new frame). This is also complicated, likely a combination of missense and frameshift. Similar to Mutant 3, while it would likely inactivate the gene, the premature stop codon in Mutant 2 provides a more certain outcome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position. This will terminate protein synthesis, resulting in a drastically shortened and non-functional polypeptide. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the function of the target gene and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
