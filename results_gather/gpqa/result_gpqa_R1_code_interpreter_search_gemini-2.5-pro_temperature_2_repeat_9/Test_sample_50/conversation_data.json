    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a potential of zero (V = 0). We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Method of Image Charges:** This problem is a classic application of the \"method of image charges.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (`V(r=R) = 0`), we can replace the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that since `d > R`, the position `b` is inside the sphere, and the image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` against the electric force from the sphere. Since the force is attractive (`q'` is opposite in sign to `q`), the work done by the external agent will be negative, and thus the potential energy of the system will be negative.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method A: Integrating the Force**\n    *   The potential energy `U` is the work done `W` to assemble the system. `W = ∫ F_ext ⋅ dr`. The external force `F_ext` is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force `F_elec` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. So, `U = W = -∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx`.\n    *   The force `F_elec` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` at `b = R^2/x`.\n    *   `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n    *   `F_elec(x) = -k * q² * R / (x * (x²-R²)/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n    *   Now, we integrate to find the energy `U`:\n        `U = - ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n        `U = k * q² * R ∫_∞^d x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n    *   Let's use a u-substitution: `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = k * q² * R * (1/2) ∫_∞^{d²-R²} 1/u² du`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/u]_∞^{d²-R²}`\n        `U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/(d² - R²) - (-1/∞)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    **Method B: Using Potential (Simpler Approach)**\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the interaction can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charges (the source of the potential) are themselves created by and proportional to the charge `q`.\n    *   Using the image charge method, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   Distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`.\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same result: `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) U = -(1/2) * kq² R / (d² - R²)\n    *   B) U = -kq² d / (d² - R²)\n    *   C) U = -(1/2) kq² d / (d² + R²)\n    *   D) U = -(1/2) kq² R² / (d² - R²)\n\n    Our calculated expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
