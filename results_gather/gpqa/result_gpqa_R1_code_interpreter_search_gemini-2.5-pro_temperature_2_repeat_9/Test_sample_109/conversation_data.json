    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Define Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be detectable by *both* observatories, it must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Positional Criterion:** The star must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** The star must be bright enough to be detected by both instruments.\n\n#### **1. Positional Criterion (Declination)**\n\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** is located in Hawaii at a latitude of approximately +20° North. A star is visible from this location if its declination (DEC) is greater than the latitude minus 90 degrees.\n    *   Visibility from Keck: DEC > 20° - 90° = **-70°**\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is located in Chile at a latitude of approximately -24° South. A star is visible from this location if its declination is less than the latitude plus 90 degrees.\n    *   Visibility from Paranal: DEC < -24° + 90° = **+66°**\n*   **Combined Positional Criterion:** To be visible from both, a star's declination must be in the range **-70° < DEC < +66°**. The problem asks us to disregard pointing limits, so we only consider whether the star can ever rise above the horizon.\n\n#### **2. Brightness Criterion (Apparent V Magnitude)**\n\n*   The **ESPRESSO** spectrograph can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 17.0 mag.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: `m_V` < 17.0\n*   The **HIRES** spectrograph can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 16.0 mag.\n    *   HIRES limit: `m_V` < 16.0\n*   **Combined Brightness Criterion:** To be observed by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, its apparent V magnitude must be **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n#### **Formula for Apparent Magnitude**\n\nWhen the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is not given directly, it must be calculated from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and interstellar absorption (`A_V`) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10pc) + A_V`\nWhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nLet's check each star against the combined criteria: **-70° < DEC < +66°** and **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star(name, ra_str, dec, apparent_mag=None, absolute_mag=None, distance_pc=None, e_b_v=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both Keck/HIRES and Paranal/ESPRESSO.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Combined criteria\n    min_dec = -70.0\n    max_dec = 66.0\n    mag_limit = 16.0\n\n    # 1. Check Declination\n    if not (min_dec < dec < max_dec):\n        print(f\"{name}: FAILED (Declination). DEC = {dec} deg is outside the observable range ({min_dec} to {max_dec} deg).\")\n        return False\n\n    # 2. Calculate and Check Apparent Magnitude\n    if apparent_mag is None:\n        dist_mod = 5 * math.log10(distance_pc / 10.0)\n        a_v = 0.0\n        if e_b_v:\n            a_v = 3.1 * e_b_v\n        final_mag = absolute_mag + dist_mod + a_v\n    else:\n        final_mag = apparent_mag\n\n    if not (final_mag < mag_limit):\n        print(f\"{name}: FAILED (Magnitude). Apparent Mag m_V = {final_mag:.2f} is not brighter than the limit of {mag_limit}.\")\n        return False\n        \n    print(f\"{name}: PASSED. DEC = {dec} deg and m_V = {final_mag:.2f}.\")\n    return True\n\n# --- Star Data and Evaluation ---\nprint(\"Evaluating stars against combined criteria (-70 < DEC < +66 and m_V < 16.0):\\n\")\n\n# Star 1\ncheck_star(name=\"Star1\", ra_str=\"15 deg\", dec=-75, absolute_mag=15.5, distance_pc=10)\n\n# Star 2\ncheck_star(name=\"Star2\", ra_str=\"30 deg\", dec=55, apparent_mag=16.5)\n\n# Star 3\ncheck_star(name=\"Star3\", ra_str=\"11 h\", dec=48, apparent_mag=15.5)\n\n# Star 4\ncheck_star(name=\"Star4\", ra_str=\"85 deg\", dec=-48, absolute_mag=15.5, e_b_v=0.4, distance_pc=10)\n\n# Star 5\ncheck_star(name=\"Star5\", ra_str=\"10 h\", dec=60, absolute_mag=16.5, distance_pc=5)\n```\n---\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEvaluating stars against combined criteria (-70 < DEC < +66 and m_V < 16.0):\n\nStar1: FAILED (Declination). DEC = -75 deg is outside the observable range (-70.0 to 66.0 deg).\nStar2: FAILED (Magnitude). Apparent Mag m_V = 16.50 is not brighter than the limit of 16.0.\nStar3: PASSED. DEC = 48 deg and m_V = 15.50.\nStar4: FAILED (Magnitude). Apparent Mag m_V = 16.74 is not brighter than the limit of 16.0.\nStar5: PASSED. DEC = 60 deg and m_V = 15.00.\n```\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Star 1:** Fails the declination check.\n*   **Star 2:** Fails the brightness check.\n*   **Star 3:** Passes both the declination and brightness checks.\n*   **Star 4:** Fails the brightness check after calculating its apparent magnitude.\n*   **Star 5:** Passes both the declination and brightness checks after calculating its apparent magnitude.\n\nThe stars that can be detected by both instruments are **Star 3 and Star 5**.\n\n<<<B>>>",
