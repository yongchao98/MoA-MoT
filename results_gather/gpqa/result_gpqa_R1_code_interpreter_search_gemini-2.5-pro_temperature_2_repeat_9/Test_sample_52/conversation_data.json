    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains 2 oxygen atoms. All options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically imply a para-substitution pattern, where there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This would account for a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets). This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a prop-1-en-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n        *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. One -CH3 group is from the prop-1-en-yl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No -CH2 Groups:** The molecule does not contain any methylene (-CH2) groups. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   **Substituent 1:** Based on the vinyl-H signals, one substituent is a prop-1-en-yl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** This must be an ester group and contain the second -CH3 group, but no -CH2 groups. The simplest possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This has the formula C2H3O2 and contains a methyl group with no methylene group.\n        *   An acetate group attached via oxygen: `-O-CO-CH3`. This also has the formula C2H3O2 and fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Assemble a plausible molecular structure and determine its formula:**\n    Let's combine the parts:\n    *   Benzene core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2 (from either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = 2 oxygens.\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate has this formula and fits every detail from the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The expected DBE for our deduced structure is:\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1\n    *   **Total Expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n    Now let's calculate the DBE for each option provided:\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but constructing a structure that fits the strict NMR data - particularly \"no CH2\" and only \"two CH3 signals\" - is not possible).\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (DBE is too low. It cannot account for a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond).\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (DBE is too high. This would require an additional ring or double bond, which is inconsistent with the NMR data).\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (DBE matches perfectly).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a given chemical formula CxHyOz.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.match(r'C(\\d+)H(\\d+)O(\\d+)', formula)\n        if not parts:\n            return f\"Invalid formula format: {formula}\"\n        C = int(parts.group(1))\n        H = int(parts.group(2))\n        dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n        return dbe\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Expected DBE based on structure: Ring(4) + C=C(1) + C=O(1) = 6\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {formula}, DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structural analysis points directly to the formula C11H12O2. The DBE calculation confirms that C11H12O2 (DBE=6) is a perfect fit, while options B (DBE=5) and C (DBE=7) are inconsistent with the required structural features. Although option A (C12H14O2) also has the correct DBE of 6, it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that also satisfies the very specific NMR constraints (di-substituted, no -CH2 groups, and exactly two -CH3 signals). Therefore, the only correct answer is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
