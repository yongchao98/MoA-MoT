    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravity of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight (radial velocity).\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) due to the Doppler effect: $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The maximum wavelength shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    For the two systems:\n    -   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    -   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the RV Semi-Amplitude Equation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) can be expressed as:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    -   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    -   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    -   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    -   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane). $M_p \\sin i$ is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is what can be determined from RV measurements alone.\n\n4.  **Identify the Relationship between Period (P) and RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** We need to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation to see how $P$ depends on $K$ and the other parameters.\n    From the equation above, we can see that for a given set of masses and inclination, $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    This means $P^{-1/3} \\propto K$, which can be rewritten as $P^{1/3} \\propto 1/K$, and finally $P \\propto 1/K^3$ or $P \\propto K^{-3}$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$). In the context of RV measurements, \"similar masses\" implies that the measured quantity, $M_p \\sin i$, is approximately the same for both planets. Therefore, all the mass-dependent terms in the equation are constant between the two systems.\n    So, we can write the ratio of the periods as:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We already found that $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$. Now we can substitute this into our period ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3}$\n    To get the numerical value, we compute $(5/7)^3$.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# The ratio P2/P1 is equal to (K1/K2)^3, where K is the RV semi-amplitude.\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the wavelength shift delta_lambda.\n# So, K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 5 / 7.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has provided the following code output: `0.3644314868804665`.\n\nThis is the numerical result of the calculation performed in the reasoning step.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n1.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is proportional to the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$.\n2.  For a given star and planet mass, the orbital period ($P$) is related to the semi-amplitude ($K$) by the formula $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  This relationship can be rearranged to find the period's dependency on the semi-amplitude: $P \\propto K^{-3}$.\n4.  To find the ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_1$, we can use the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: $P_2 / P_1 = (K_2 / K_1)^{-3} = (K_1 / K_2)^3$.\n5.  Substituting the known ratio $K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$ into the equation gives: $P_2 / P_1 = (5 / 7)^3$.\n6.  The python code calculated this value to be approximately 0.364.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated ratio of the periods is approximately 0.364, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
