    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$ <=> $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$\n\n    The problem describes a solution of the complex, which will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions. The dissociation equilibrium is the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$ <=> $Ca^{2+}$ + $EDTA^{4−}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$):**\n    The formation constant (also given as KCa-EDTA) is defined for the formation reaction:\n    $K_f$ = $\\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4−}]}$ = 5 x 10^10\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, and we want to find the concentration of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2−}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4−}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Solve the equilibrium expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f$ = $\\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)}$ = $\\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    5 x 10^10 = $\\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex form. This means that the amount of dissociation (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ $\\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n    $x^2$ = $\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2$ = 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = $\\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    x = 6.3245... x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    C) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    Our calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
