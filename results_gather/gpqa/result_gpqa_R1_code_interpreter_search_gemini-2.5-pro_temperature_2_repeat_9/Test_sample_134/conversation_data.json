    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian describing the coupling of X to fermions is given by:\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right)$\n\nFrom this Lagrangian, the interaction term between the boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$) is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis interaction vertex allows for the decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair, i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$m_X \\geq m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nSince a particle and its corresponding antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$m_X \\geq 2m_f$\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X as $m_X = 6$ GeV. Therefore, the decay is allowed for any fermion $f$ whose mass satisfies:\n$m_f \\leq \\frac{m_X}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ GeV}}{2} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, we need to compare the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) with this threshold of 3 GeV.\n\n**Lepton Masses:**\n*   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Neutrinos ($\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$): Their masses are extremely small (less than 1 eV), so decays to neutrino-antineutrino pairs are kinematically allowed but usually not listed in such options unless specified.\n\n**Quark Masses:** (Note: Quarks are confined within hadrons, so we consider their constituent or current masses as relevant scales).\n*   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Allowed.\n*   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Allowed.\n*   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Allowed.\n*   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n*   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\nIn summary, the kinematically allowed decay channels into fermion-antifermion pairs are:\n$X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n$X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n$X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n$X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n$X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n$X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n\nNow let's compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: This option includes all the allowed decays and excludes the forbidden ones ($b\\bar{b}$ and $t\\bar{t}$). This is the correct list.\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: Incorrect, as it includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays.\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: Incorrect, as it includes the forbidden $t\\bar{t}$ decay.\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$: Incorrect, as it includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$ decay.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
