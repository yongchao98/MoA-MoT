    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance.\n\n2.  **Relate Angular Size to Physical Size:** The physical diameter ($D$) of the black hole's event horizon can be found using the small-angle approximation, which relates the angular size ($\\theta$), the distance ($d$), and the diameter ($D$). The formula is $D = d \\times \\theta_{rad}$, where $\\theta$ must be in radians. The radius of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius ($R_s$), is half the diameter, so $R_s = D/2$.\n\n3.  **Convert Units:**\n    *   The distance $d$ is given in parsecs (pc) and needs to be converted to meters (m).\n        *   $d = 10^{10}$ pc\n        *   1 pc $\\approx 3.086 \\times 10^{16}$ m\n        *   $d \\approx 10^{10} \\times (3.086 \\times 10^{16}) = 3.086 \\times 10^{26}$ m\n    *   The angular size $\\theta$ is given in degrees and needs to be converted to radians.\n        *   $\\theta = 10^{-17}$ degrees\n        *   $\\theta_{rad} = \\theta_{deg} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radians\n\n4.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius ($R_s$):**\n    *   $R_s = \\frac{d \\times \\theta_{rad}}{2}$\n    *   $R_s = \\frac{(3.086 \\times 10^{26} \\text{ m}) \\times (10^{-17} \\times \\pi/180)}{2}$\n    *   $R_s \\approx \\frac{3.086 \\times \\pi}{360} \\times 10^{9} \\text{ m} \\approx 2.69 \\times 10^7$ m\n\n5.  **Use the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula:** The entropy ($S_{BH}$) of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which relates the entropy to the area of the event horizon ($A$).\n    *   $S_{BH} = \\frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \\hbar G}$\n    *   The area of a spherical event horizon is $A = 4\\pi R_s^2$.\n    *   Substituting $A$ into the formula gives: $S_{BH} = \\frac{k_B c^3 (4\\pi R_s^2)}{4 \\hbar G} = \\frac{\\pi k_B c^3 R_s^2}{\\hbar G}$\n\n6.  **Gather Physical Constants:**\n    *   Boltzmann constant ($k_B$) $\\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K\n    *   Speed of light ($c$) $\\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) $\\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n    *   Gravitational constant ($G$) $\\approx 6.67 \\times 10^{-11}$ N·m$^2$/kg$^2$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Entropy:** Now, plug all the values into the entropy formula.
