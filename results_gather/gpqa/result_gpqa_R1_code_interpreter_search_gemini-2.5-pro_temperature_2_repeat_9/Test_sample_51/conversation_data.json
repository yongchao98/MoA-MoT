    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem asks for the change in the population ratio of two energy levels of an atom at different temperatures. According to the principles of statistical mechanics for a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the number of atoms `N` in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    -   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    -   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    -   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    -   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor of Change:** The problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. This is the ratio of `R` at the temperature without spots (`T_quiet = 6000 K`) to `R` at the temperature with spots (`T_spots = 5500 K`).\n\n    Let's call this factor `F`:\n    `F = R_quiet / R_spots`\n    `F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_quiet)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_quiet)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\n    Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), we get:\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_quiet)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_quiet) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n\n    The formula for the energy of a photon is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light. To simplify calculations, we can use the `hc` constant in units of eV·nm, which is approximately 1240 eV·nm.\n\n    -   Convert wavelength `λ` to nanometers: `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n    -   Calculate `ΔE`:\n        `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** Now we have all the necessary values to substitute into the factor equation `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_quiet) ]`.\n\n    -   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n    -   Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n    -   `T_quiet = 6000 K`\n    -   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n    We will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define constants\nh_eVs = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck constant in eV*s\nc_ms = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\nk_eV_K = 8.617333262e-5  # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n\n# Given values\nwavelength_A = 1448.0      # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_quiet = 6000.0         # Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500.0         # Temperature with spots in Kelvin\n\n# Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) in eV\ndelta_E = (h_eVs * c_ms) / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the term inside the exponent\nexponent_term = (delta_E / k_eV_K) * ((1 / T_spots) - (1 / T_quiet))\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent_term)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nfactor=4.505008542055106\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the factor is approximately 4.505.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio `N₂/N₁` changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This corresponds to the calculated `R_quiet / R_spots`, which is `~4.5`. This result aligns with the provided option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem concerns the population of atomic energy levels at different temperatures in a system assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship describing this is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level 2 (`N₂`) to a lower energy level 1 (`N₁`) is given by:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the two levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the two states:** We have two states to compare:\n    *   State 1 (Quiet Sun): Temperature `T_quiet = 6000 K`. The ratio is `R_quiet`.\n    *   State 2 (Spotted Sun): Temperature `T_spots = 5500 K`. The ratio is `R_spots`.\n    Note: The problem mentions that the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots. This means `R_spots` is smaller than `R_quiet`. We are asked to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does *not* have spots compared to when it *has* spots. This translates to calculating the ratio `R_quiet / R_spots`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the factor:** Let's call the factor `F`.\n    `F = R_quiet / R_spots`\n    `F = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_quiet)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    The term for statistical weights, `(g₂ / g₁)`, is constant for the two levels and cancels out.\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_quiet)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    Using the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a - b)`, we get:\n    `F = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_quiet) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_quiet) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy difference `ΔE`:** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.

In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.\n\nA) ~2.9\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~1.1\nD) ~7.8\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
