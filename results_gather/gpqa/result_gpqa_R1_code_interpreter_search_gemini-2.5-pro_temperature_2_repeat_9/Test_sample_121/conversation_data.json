    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has an α-carbon (the methyl group) which can be brominated. The typical HVZ reaction uses PBr₃ as a catalyst, but this combination of reagents can achieve the same outcome.\n    *   **Product 1:** The α-carbon is brominated.\n        CH₃COOH → BrCH₂COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:**\n        BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate) + H₂O\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (S₂). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion from the α-carbon of ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:**\n        BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate) + NaBr\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n        *   **a) Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        *   **b) First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br) in an S₂ reaction.\n        *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming a new carbanion.\n        *   **d) Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is tethered to the other end of the pentane chain which still has a bromine atom. It performs an intramolecular S₂ attack, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1 (the carbon with the CN and COOEt groups) and C4 (the carbon directly opposite). Because the molecule possesses this plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically distinct proton environments. We must also remember that protons on the same carbon in a ring (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n\n    1.  **C2 and C6 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, on each carbon, the axial and equatorial protons are in different environments. Therefore, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) give one signal, and the two equatorial protons give a second signal.\n        *   **Signal 1:** H₂ₐₓ & H₆ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 2:** H₂ₑq & H₆ₑq (2H)\n        *(2 signals so far)*\n\n    2.  **C3 and C5 Protons:** The same logic applies here as for C2/C6. The two carbons are equivalent, but the axial and equatorial protons on them are not.\n        *   **Signal 3:** H₃ₐₓ & H₅ₐₓ (2H)\n        *   **Signal 4:** H₃ₑq & H₅ₑq (2H)\n        *(4 signals so far)*\n\n    3.  **C4 Protons:** Carbon C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. It has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. They are not interconverted by any symmetry operation and are in different chemical environments (e.g., one points towards the substituents on C1, the other away). They are diastereotopic.\n        *   **Signal 5:** H₄ₐₓ (1H)\n        *   **Signal 6:** H₄ₑq (1H)\n        *(6 signals so far)*\n\n    4.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        *   **Methylene (-OCH₂-) Protons:** Since the overall molecule is achiral, these two geminal protons are enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and give a single signal.\n        *   **Signal 7:** -OCH₂- (2H)\n        *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond.\n        *   **Signal 8:** -CH₃ (3H)\n        *(8 signals so far)*\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy adding up all the distinct signals, we have:\n6 signals from the cyclohexane ring + 2 signals from the ethyl group = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
