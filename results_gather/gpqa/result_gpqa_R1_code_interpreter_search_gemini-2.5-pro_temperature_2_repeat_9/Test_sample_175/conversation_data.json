    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. First, measuring observable `P` and getting the result `0`, and immediately after, measuring observable `Q` and getting the result `-1`.\n\n2.  **Quantum Measurement Principles:**\n    *   The possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of its corresponding operator.\n    *   The probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector `|ψ⟩` onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`. Probability = `|⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2`.\n    *   After a measurement yields an eigenvalue `λ`, the system's state \"collapses\" into the corresponding eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`. This new state becomes the starting point for any subsequent measurement.\n    *   The probability of a sequence of events is the product of the probabilities of each step. `Prob(A then B) = Prob(A) * Prob(B | after A)`.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    **Step A: Define the initial state and operators and normalize the state.**\n\n    *   Initial state vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n    *   Operator P:\n        ```\n        P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n             [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n             [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Operator Q:\n        ```\n        Q = [[1, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, -1]]\n        ```\n    *   First, we must normalize the initial state `|ψ⟩`.\n        The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n        The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n        The normalized state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n    **Step B: Find the probability of the first measurement (P=0).**\n\n    *   We need the eigenvector of operator `P` corresponding to the eigenvalue `0`.\n    *   Let's find the eigenvalues of `P` by solving `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0   ],\n              [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2 ],\n              [ 0,  1/√2,  -λ  ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n        The eigenvalues of P are `λ = 0, 1, -1`. The question asks for the outcome `P=0`, which is a valid eigenvalue.\n    *   Now, find the eigenvector `|p=0⟩` for `λ = 0` by solving `(P - 0*I)v = 0`, which is `Pv = 0`.\n        ```\n        [[0, 1/√2, 0],   [x]   [0]\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [y] = [0]\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]   [z]   [0]\n        ```\n        From the first row, `(1/√2)y = 0`, so `y=0`.\n        From the second row, `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, so `x = -z`.\n        The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`, or `x[1, 0, -1]`.\n    *   Normalize this eigenvector: The norm of `[1, 0, -1]` is `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n        The normalized eigenvector is `|p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n    *   Calculate the probability `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n        The inner product `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩` is the dot product of `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]` and `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n        `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(1/√6) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`.\n        `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n    **Step C: State Collapse and Second Measurement (Q=-1).**\n\n    *   After measuring `P=0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. The new state is `|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n    *   Now, we measure `Q` on this new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want the probability of getting `Q=-1`.\n    *   We need the eigenvector of `Q` for the eigenvalue `-1`.\n    *   `Q` is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n        The eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = -1` is `|q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`. This vector is already normalized.\n    *   Calculate the probability `Prob(Q=-1 | from |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n        The inner product is `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩`, which is the dot product of `[0, 0, 1]` and `|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n        `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`.\n        `Prob(Q=-1 | from |ψ'⟩) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n    **Step D: Calculate the Total Probability.**\n\n    *   The total probability is the product of the probabilities from Step B and Step C.\n    *   `Total Prob = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | from collapsed state) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nTo verify the result, I will use Python.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the initial state (unnormalized column vector)\npsi = np.array([[-1], [2], [1]])\n\n# Define the operators\nP = np.array([\n    [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]\n])\n\nQ = np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Normalize the initial state\nnorm_psi = np.linalg.norm(psi)\npsi_norm = psi / norm_psi\n\n# Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P\neigvals_P, eigvecs_P = np.linalg.eig(P)\n# Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0\nidx_p0 = np.where(np.isclose(eigvals_P, 0))[0][0]\neigenvector_p0 = eigvecs_P[:, idx_p0].reshape(-1, 1)\n\n# Calculate the probability of measuring P=0\n# Prob = |<eigenvector|psi_norm>|^2\nprob_p0 = np.abs(np.vdot(eigenvector_p0, psi_norm))**2\n\n# After measurement, the state collapses to the eigenvector\nstate_after_p = eigenvector_p0\n\n# Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for Q\neigvals_Q, eigvecs_Q = np.linalg.eig(Q)\n# Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1\nidx_q_neg1 = np.where(np.isclose(eigvals_Q, -1))[0][0]\neigenvector_q_neg1 = eigvecs_Q[:, idx_q_neg1].reshape(-1, 1)\n\n# Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 from the collapsed state\nprob_q_neg1_after_p = np.abs(np.vdot(eigenvector_q_neg1, state_after_p))**2\n\n# The total probability is the product of the individual probabilities\ntotal_probability = prob_p0 * prob_q_neg1_after_p\n\nprint(f\"{total_probability}\")\n```\n>>>0.16666666666666666\n\nThe python code output is approximately 0.166667, which corresponds to the fraction 1/6. This confirms the manual calculation.\n\nFinal Answer is 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>",
