    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not adjacent to any other protons. This is typical for a methyl group attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the carbonyl carbon of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is right in the range for an acetyl methyl group. All four choices are \"acetates,\" so this signal confirms the presence of the `CH3COO-` functional group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines, a doublet). This indicates a `-CH-CH3` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH3`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (from signal 2). (3+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to one other single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is directly attached to a double bond carbon (`C=CH-`). This proton is part of the `-CH=CH-CH3` system.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. Its high chemical shift (deshielding) suggests it is on a carbon atom directly attached to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the geometry (stereochemistry) of the double bond. For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement (protons on opposite sides) gives a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement (protons on the same side) gives a smaller coupling constant, typically 6-12 Hz.\n        The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** double bond.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the integration of the signals not related to the acetate group (1H + 3H + 1H = 5H), we can deduce that the alkenyl part is a propenyl group (C3H5). This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n*   The signals describe a `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment attached to the acetate oxygen.\n*   The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the double bond has a trans geometry. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, the coupling constant would be smaller (~6-12 Hz).\nB) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, the NMR spectrum for a butenyl group would be different and the total hydrogen count for the alkenyl part doesn't match.\nC) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, for the same reasons as B and A.\nD) **Trans-propenyl acetate**: Correct. The structure matches all the provided 1H NMR data: four distinct signals with the correct integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and a large coupling constant indicative of a trans double bond.\n\nThe structure of Trans-propenyl acetate and the assignment of protons is:\n\n        H (7.0 ppm, d, J=16 Hz)     H (5.5 ppm, dq)\n         \\                           /\n          C === C\n         /       \\\n      O-CO-CH3 (2.1 ppm, s)           CH3 (1.6 ppm, d)\n\n<<<D>>>"
