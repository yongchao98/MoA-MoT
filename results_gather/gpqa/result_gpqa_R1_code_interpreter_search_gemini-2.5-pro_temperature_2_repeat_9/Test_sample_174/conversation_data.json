    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole with its dipole moment `p` also along the z-axis. The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from such a dipole is a fundamental result in electromagnetism and is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the wavelength `λ` and the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\n**Part 1: Angular Dependence and Fraction of Maximum Power**\n\nThe radiated power `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`. Therefore, `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nSo, the maximum power `A` is:\n`A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\nWe want to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We substitute this value into the formula:\n`P(at 30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince we found that `A = C`, we can write:\n`P(at 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n`P(at 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n\n**Part 2: Wavelength Dependence**\n\nNow, let's analyze how the radiated power depends on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `c` is the speed of light, `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment, and `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πν`, where `ν` is the frequency, and `c = νλ`. This gives `ν = c/λ`, so we can express `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n`ω = 2πc / λ`\n\nNow, substitute this into the power formula. We are interested in the proportionality with `λ`:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴`\n`dP/dΩ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis shows that the radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is the characteristic dependence of Rayleigh scattering and electric dipole radiation.\n\nTherefore, a possible form of the function `f(λ, θ)` has a dependence of `λ⁻⁴` on the wavelength.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two parts of our analysis:\n1.  The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
