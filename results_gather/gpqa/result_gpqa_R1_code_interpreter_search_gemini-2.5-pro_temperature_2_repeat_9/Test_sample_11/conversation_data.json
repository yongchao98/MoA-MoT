    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Physics Principles**\nThis is a particle decay problem. The key principles governing this process are the **Conservation of Energy** and the **Conservation of Momentum**. Since the particles involved can move at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($\\pi^+$) at rest.\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$) moving in opposite directions.\n\nThe decay reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n### **2. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero.\n$p_{initial} = 0$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n$p_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n\nThis implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and the neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = - \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\nSo, both final particles have the same magnitude of momentum, which we'll call *p*.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy ($m_{\\pi}c^2$).\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino: Neutrinos have a very tiny mass, so we can approximate them as massless ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$). For a massless particle, the energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\nTherefore, the energy conservation equation becomes:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n### **4. Solve for the Momentum (pc)**\nNow we solve this equation for the term *pc*, which represents the momentum of each particle in energy units (MeV).\n\n1.  Isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n3.  Expand the left side:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n4.  The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n5.  Rearrange to solve for *pc*:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n### **5. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nWe can now calculate the numerical values using the provided masses and then find the kinetic energies. A Python script is suitable for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the derived formula\npc = ((m_pi_c2**2) - (m_mu_c2**2)) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# For a massless neutrino, total energy E = pc, and kinetic energy KE = E.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# First, find the total energy of the muon using conservation of energy: E_mu = E_pi - E_nu\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_nu\n# The kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy: KE = E - mc^2\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (MeV): {KE_mu}\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (MeV): {KE_nu}\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (MeV): 4.122636103151862\nKE of neutrino (MeV): 29.77736389684814\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places, we get:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$): **29.78 MeV** (approximately 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the physics and the calculation:\n\n**1. The Physics Principle: Conservation Laws**\n\nThis problem involves a particle decay. In any particle decay, two fundamental principles must be satisfied:\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Applying the Laws to the Decay**\n\nThe decay is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$) = 0\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$) = Rest Mass Energy of the pion = $m_{\\pi}c^2$\n\n*   **Final State:** The muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) are moving.\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$. By conservation of momentum:\n        $p_i = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n        $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n        This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum '$p$'.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two product particles:\n        $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of any particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2}$, where $m_0c^2$ is its rest mass energy.\n\n**3. Setting up the Energy Equation**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nLet's substitute the energy formulas for the muon and neutrino:\n*   $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Neutrinos ($\\nu$) are considered to be effectively massless in these calculations ($m_{\\nu}c^2 \\approx 0$). For a massless particle, the energy formula simplifies to $E = pc$. So, $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\nOur energy conservation equation becomes:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe now solve this equation to find the momentum '$p$' (or more conveniently, '$pc$'), and from there, we can find the kinetic energies.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Rest mass of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n*   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = E_{\\nu} - 0 = pc$\n\nLet's use the conservation of energy equation again:\n$E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\nSubstitute $E_{\\mu} = KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2$ and $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$:\n$KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\nRearranging gives the total kinetic energy released:\n$KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n$KE_{total} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThis means the sum of the kinetic energies of the two particles is 33.9 MeV.\n\nFrom the calculation performed by the code:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$) ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\nLet's check the sum: 4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92 MeV, which matches our calculation. The pair of values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
