    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the products and answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of KOH. Adamantane is a tricyclic C10 hydrocarbon (C10H16). 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The total integration is 14H, so the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon part remains C10H14.\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strongly indicates a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   This implies a molecular formula of **C10H14O**.\n*   **Deduce the structure type of Product 1:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C10H14O is calculated as: DoU = (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n    *   A C=O double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. This leaves three degrees of unsaturation for rings. Therefore, Product 1 should be a **tricyclic ketone**.\n\n**Step 2: Re-evaluating Product 1 based on subsequent reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction to form Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. So, Product 2 is an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction to form Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup, which specifically cleaves C=C double bonds.\n*   **Crucial Deduction:** The fact that Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis means it **must contain a C=C double bond**. Since Product 2 is formed by a simple reduction of the ketone in Product 1, Product 1 must have also contained that C=C double bond.\n*   **Contradiction and Resolution:**\n    *   Our initial analysis suggested Product 1 is a tricyclic ketone (DoU = 3 rings + 1 C=O = 4), which would be saturated.\n    *   The ozonolysis reaction requires Product 1 to be an unsaturated ketone. An unsaturated ketone containing one C=C and one C=O has DoU = 1+1 = 2 from functional groups.\n    *   If the formula is C10H14O (DoU=4), then DoU_rings = DoU_total - DoU_functional_groups = 4 - 2 = 2.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 1 must be a bicyclic unsaturated ketone (enone)** with the formula C10H14O. This resolves the contradiction; the initial adamantane cage must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of Product 1 and its successors based on symmetry.**\n\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 1 (4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H)) shows high symmetry. Specifically, the signal at 4.79 ppm corresponds to two equivalent protons.\n*   In an unsaturated ketone, a signal in this region could be vinylic (on the C=C bond). The equivalence of these two protons implies a symmetric `R-CH=CH-R` structure, where a plane of symmetry or a C2 axis makes the two vinylic protons and the two R groups equivalent.\n*   Let's assume the signal at 4.79 ppm belongs to the two vinylic protons of a symmetric C=C bond. So Product 1 contains a `...-CH=CH-...` fragment in a symmetric bicyclic framework.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Product 3 and the environment of the key proton.**\n\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to an alcohol. The symmetric `...-CH=CH-...` unit is preserved.\n*   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the C=C bond in Product 2 opens the ring, creating two aldehyde groups. The resulting molecule will be a single, larger ring structure containing two aldehyde groups and one alcohol group (`...OHC- ... -CH(OH)- ... -CHO...`).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, appearing at δ 9-10 ppm. The question asks for the coupling pattern of this proton.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** The coupling pattern of the aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). Let the structure be `R'-CαHn-CHO`. The multiplicity will be `n+1`.\n\n**Step 5: Deduce the substitution of the α-carbon.**\n\n*   The α-carbon in Product 3 was the allylic carbon in Products 1 and 2 (`...-Cα-CH=CH-...`). We need to determine if Cα is a CH₂ group, a CH group, or a quaternary carbon.\n*   Adamantane contains only CH and CH₂ groups. It's likely that the rearranged bicyclic structure also primarily consists of CH and CH₂ groups.\n*   Let's analyze two possibilities for the symmetric fragment in Product 1:\n    1.  The allylic carbons are CH groups: `...-CH-CH=CH-CH-...`. This is consistent with the NMR of Product 1 having signals for 2 vinylic protons and 2 allylic protons (which would be part of the 10H multiplet).\n    2.  The allylic carbons are CH₂ groups: `...-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-...`. This would mean 4 allylic protons, which could also be buried in the 10H multiplet.\n*   Let's see what each possibility leads to for the aldehyde proton in Product 3:\n    1.  If Cα is a CH group: The fragment in Product 3 is `R'-CH-CHO`. The aldehyde proton couples to one proton on Cα, which would primarily give a **doublet**. This is not an option by itself.\n    2.  If Cα is a CH₂ group: The fragment is `R'-CH₂-CHO`. The aldehyde proton couples to two protons on Cα, which would give a **triplet** (Option A), assuming the two protons are equivalent or their coupling constants are unresolved.\n*   However, a more detailed analysis is required. Aldehyde protons can exhibit long-range coupling (typically 4-bond `⁴J` coupling).\n*   Let's reconsider possibility 1 (Cα is a CH group). This gives a doublet from coupling to the α-proton. If this CH group is attached to a CH₂ group (`...-CH₂-CH(R)-CHO`), the aldehyde proton can show long-range `⁴J` coupling to the two protons of the CH₂ group. This would split the doublet into a doublet of triplets.\n\n**Final Deduction:**\n\n1.  Let's assume the allylic carbon (`Cα`) is a `CH` group, which is bonded to a `CH₂` group (`Cβ`). This scenario is plausible from the parent adamantane structure.\n2.  The fragment around the aldehyde group in Product 3 would be `...-CH₂(β)-CH(α)-CHO`.\n3.  The aldehyde proton couples to the α-proton (`³J` coupling), splitting the signal into a **doublet**.\n4.  The aldehyde proton also couples to the two β-protons (`⁴J` coupling), splitting the signal into a **triplet**.\n5.  The combination of these couplings results in a **doublet of triplets**. This matches option B and is a more specific (and thus more likely intended) answer than a simple triplet, which would require ignoring either long-range coupling or diastereotopicity.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the aldehyde proton) in product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
