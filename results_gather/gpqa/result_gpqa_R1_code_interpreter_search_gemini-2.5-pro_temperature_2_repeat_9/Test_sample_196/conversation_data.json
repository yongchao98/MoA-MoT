    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent (which must be an alkyl group, as it is less deshielding).\n    *   So far, the structure is `R-C₆H₄-COOH`, where R is an alkyl group. Now we identify the R group from the remaining signals.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: `-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: `-CH-CH₃`.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons must be the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It's a multiplet because it is adjacent to both a -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the -CH- group (1 proton), causing complex splitting.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton must be the methine (-CH-) group attached to the benzene ring. It is split by the adjacent -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the -CH₂- group (2 protons), resulting in a multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the R group:** Combining the fragments gives `Ring-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`. This is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Putting everything together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Critically, it can reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Determining the Final Product**\n\n1.  The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n2.  The reaction with red P / HI will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n3.  The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 is already an alkane chain and will not be affected by the reducing agent.\n4.  Therefore, the product is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is more systematically named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our predicted product with the given options:\nA) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\nB) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is a carboxylic acid, not a fully reduced product.\nC) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\nD) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
