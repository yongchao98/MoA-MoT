    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group). This hydrogen can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol (a compound with a hydroxyl group attached to a double-bonded carbon).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. Let's examine the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups. These alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\\\n          HC   CH\n          ||   ||\n          HC   CH\n            \\\\ //\n             O\n        ```\n        (Carbons adjacent to C=O are doubly bonded and have no H atoms).\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens. Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens (flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups), this compound readily undergoes tautomerism to form its more stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic.\n        ```\n           O               OH\n          // \\             // \\\n        H2C   C=O   <=>   HC   C-OH\n         |    |           ||   |\n        O=C   CH2         HO-C  CH\n          \\  //             \\ //\n           C=O               C-OH\n        ```\n        (This shows tautomerism).\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is also planar and possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C=C double bond. Since it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   A (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
