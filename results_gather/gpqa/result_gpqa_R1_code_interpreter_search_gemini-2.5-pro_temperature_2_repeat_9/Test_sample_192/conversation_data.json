    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax, let's call it `n(plx)`, and the parallax `plx`. This is stated as \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Mathematically, this means:\n        `dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx^5`\n        where `N` is the number of stars.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars per unit distance, let's call it `n(r)`, changes with distance `r`. Mathematically, we need to find the proportionality for:\n        `dN/dr`\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:**\n    *   The fundamental connection between distance `r` and parallax `plx` is that they are inversely proportional. The standard definition used in astronomy is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n        (where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Mathematical Strategy:**\n    *   We have a relationship in terms of `plx` (`dN/dplx`) and we want to convert it into a relationship in terms of `r` (`dN/dr`). The chain rule of calculus is the perfect tool for this transformation.\n    *   The chain rule states: `dN/dr = (dN/dplx) * (dplx/dr)`.\n    *   However, since the number of stars must be a positive quantity and `dplx/dr` is negative (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases), we should consider the relationship between the number densities. The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax range `dplx` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance range `dr`. So, `(dN/dplx) dplx = (dN/dr) dr`. We are interested in the magnitudes, so we can write:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/dplx) * |dplx/dr|`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the derivative `dplx/dr`**\n        Given `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n        Using the power rule for differentiation:\n        `dplx/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n        The absolute value is:\n        `|dplx/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Substitute into the chain rule equation.**\n        We have:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (dN/dplx) * |dplx/dr|`\n        Substitute the given proportionality `dN/dplx ∝ 1/plx⁵` and the calculated `|dplx/dr| = 1/r²`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Express everything in terms of `r`.**\n        Now, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation from Step 2:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
