    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base.\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor (nucleophile):** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, bulky base. It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C=O at C-1).\n    *   **C-2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no protons to be abstracted.\n    *   **C-6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible position for deprotonation is C-6. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C-6 to form a thermodynamically stable enolate.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is the electrophilic site for the conjugate addition.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone (nucleophilic at C-6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (usually from workup or the conjugate acid of the base) yields the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (A):**\n    *   Starting ketone structure at the relevant carbons: ...-C(Et)(Me)-C(=O)-CH₂-...-CH(Me)-...\n    *   The hydrogen at C-6 is replaced by the group derived from ethyl acrylate, which is `-CH₂CH₂COOEt`.\n    *   The final product structure has the following connections:\n        *   C-1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C-2: Substituted with one ethyl and one methyl group.\n        *   C-6: Substituted with one methyl group and one `-(CH₂)₂-COOEt` (3-ethoxy-3-oxopropyl) group.\n6.  **Name the product (A):**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted `ethyl propanoate`. This means the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to C-3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the `(...-cyclohexyl)` substituent. According to IUPAC rules, when a substituted ring is named as a substituent, the point of attachment is numbered C-1.\n    *   Let's renumber the ring based on this rule:\n        *   C-1 (of the substituent) is the original C-6 (the point of attachment). It is substituted with a methyl group.\n        *   C-2 is the original C-1, which bears the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C-3 is the original C-2, which bears an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting this together, the substituent name is:\n        *   `3-ethyl`\n        *   `1,3-dimethyl` (one methyl at the attachment point C-1, and another at C-3)\n        *   `2-oxo`\n        *   `cyclohexyl`\n    *   So, the full name for the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor (nucleophile):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which makes the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) acidic. The strong base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n4.  **The reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/cyanocarbanion is formed, which is then protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n5.  **Determine the product structure (B):**\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`) bonds to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`).\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n6.  **Name the product (B):**\n    *   We use IUPAC nomenclature. The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`. The carbon of the CN group is C-1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C-1. The chain is 6 carbons long (`hexanenitrile`).\n    *   Numbering the chain from the CN group:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   Identify and locate the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at C-4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is correct)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is correct)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is incorrect, B is incorrect)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile -> (A is correct, B is incorrect)\n\nThe only option where both products are named correctly is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
