    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis). This means the molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation around this axis.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   Structure: Quinuclidine has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions, linked by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) chains.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (and the hydrogen attached to it).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   Point Group: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes results in the **C3v** point group.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   Structure: This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core. The overall structure is highly symmetric.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Point Group: A C3 axis, a perpendicular σh, and three C2 axes perpendicular to C3 are characteristic of the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule does possess the elements of C3h symmetry (C3 and σh), D3h is a higher order, more complete description of its symmetry.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (also known as hexahydroxybenzene triscarbonate, C9O9)**\n*   Structure: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three carbonate ester rings. It is planar.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   Similar to option B, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane and passing through the center of the molecule.\n*   Point Group: The combination of these elements defines the **D3h** point group. Like molecule B, it technically \"has\" C3h symmetry, but its full point group is D3h.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate (B(O-i-Pr)3)**\n*   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B(O)3 core is planar.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   Due to the propeller-like arrangement of the three isopropoxy groups around the boron atom, there is a C3 axis passing through the boron, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups are bulky and prevent the molecule from being planar. The lowest energy conformation has C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a specific conformation (even if it's not the most stable one) that possesses a σh plane. This conformation would have the B(O)3 plane as the mirror plane, with the three isopropyl groups arranged so that for each group, one methyl is above the plane and one is below, with the C-H bond of the isopropyl's central carbon lying in the plane.\n    *   In this conformation, the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Crucially, this molecule lacks the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and it also lacks any σv planes. The bulky, asymmetric nature of the isopropyl groups prevents these additional symmetry elements.\n*   Point Group: The absence of C2 axes and σv planes means the point group cannot be D3h or C3v. The highest possible symmetry point group for triisopropyl borate is **C3h**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Molecules B and C are D3h. They have higher symmetry than C3h.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose highest possible symmetry is C3h. In questions of this type, we look for the molecule that belongs to the specified point group, not a higher symmetry supergroup.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
