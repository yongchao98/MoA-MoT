    "This problem requires us to determine which two compounds from the given options are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (except for potentially some aromatic coupling which is absent here) points towards isomers of tetramethylbenzene or other highly symmetric structures. The presence of quartets and triplets would indicate ethyl groups, which is not observed.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds:**\n\nWe need to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). Integral: 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integral: 12H.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as two separate **singlets**. Integral: 1H each.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integral: 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This results in two **singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving a single **singlet**. Integral: 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The molecule has ethyl groups. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet**.\n    *   **Summary (1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n    *   This compound can be immediately **eliminated** because the experimental spectrum only contains singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the described spectrum. Let's test the combinations.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Let's assume a 1:1 mixture.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (2H). Prehnitene contributes another singlet (2H). If these two signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrals will be 2H and 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (12H). Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each). If all three of these signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **three singlets**. The integral ratio would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination fully explains the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **Option C (Durene + Isodurene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n    *   **Option D (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), contradicting the observation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
