    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's break down the key assumptions behind this model and evaluate each option.\n\n1.  **Derivation and Assumptions of the Mott-Gurney Law:**\n    The Mott-Gurney law is derived by simultaneously solving the drift-current equation and Poisson's equation under a set of simplifying assumptions.\n    *   **Current Equation:** The total current density (J) is the sum of drift current and diffusion current. The model assumes that the applied voltage is high enough that the drift current (due to the electric field) dominates, and the diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients) can be neglected. So, J ≈ q * n(x) * μ * E(x), where q is the elementary charge, n(x) is the local carrier concentration, μ is the mobility, and E(x) is the local electric field.\n    *   **Poisson's Equation:** This equation relates the spatial variation of the electric field to the local net charge density. For an insulator where the injected charge density n(x) is much larger than the intrinsic carrier density, the equation is dE/dx = q * n(x) / ε, where ε is the permittivity (dielectric constant).\n    *   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. The contribution from the other carrier type is considered negligible. This rules out any \"two-carrier\" options.\n    *   **Trap-Free Insulator:** The material is assumed to be a perfect insulator with no electronic trap states within its bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, leading to a different J-V relationship (known as trap-limited SCLC).\n    *   **Injecting Contact:** The model assumes one contact is an \"Ohmic contact\" that acts as an infinite reservoir of carriers. This means there is no energy barrier to carrier injection from the electrode into the insulator. As soon as a voltage is applied, this contact can supply enough charge to form the space-charge region. This is a crucial boundary condition (E=0 at the injecting contact) for solving the equations. A \"Schottky contact,\" on the other hand, is a rectifying contact with an energy barrier that would limit injection, violating this assumption.\n    *   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** As mentioned above, the drift of carriers is assumed to be the sole transport mechanism. Diffusion is ignored.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   This is incorrect because the SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**. The assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible, not drift current.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** would limit the injection of carriers, violating the assumption of an unlimited supply of charge at the contact. The model requires an Ohmic contact.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for a **single-carrier** device.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   **Trap-free:** Correct.\n        *   **Single-carrier device:** Correct.\n        *   **No carrier injection barrier:** Correct. This is the definition of an ideal Ohmic injecting contact.\n        *   **Negligible diffusion current:** Correct. The current is assumed to be dominated by drift.\n        *   This statement accurately captures all the key assumptions of the Mott-Gurney model.\n\n<<<D>>>"
