    "*   **Step 1: Dilution Calculation**\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (`CH3COOH`): `moles = M * V = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol`\n    *   The initial 20.00 cm³ (`0.0200 L`) of acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Total volume of the solution before titration: `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L`\n    *   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid: `C_acid = moles / V_total = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M`\n\n*   **Step 2: Titration Reaction and Equivalence Point**\n    *   The reaction is: `CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COO- + Na+ + H2O`\n    *   To find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (`V_eq`), we use `M_acid * V_acid = M_base * V_base`.\n    *   `(0.025 M) * (40.00 mL) = (0.1 M) * V_eq`\n    *   `1.00 mmol = (0.1 M) * V_eq`\n    *   `V_eq = 10.0 mL`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n    *   25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added: `0.25 * V_eq = 0.25 * 10.0 mL = 2.50 mL`.\n    *   At this point, 25% of the `CH3COOH` has been converted to its conjugate base, `CH3COO-`. 75% of the `CH3COOH` remains.\n    *   This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH])`\n    *   First, calculate `pKa`: `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) = 4.733`\n    *   The ratio of conjugate base to acid is `[A-]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3`.\n    *   `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256`\n    *   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the `CH3COOH` has reacted with NaOH to form `CH3COO-`.\n    *   Total volume of the solution: `V_total = V_acid_diluted + V_eq = 40.00 mL + 10.0 mL = 50.0 mL = 0.0500 L`\n    *   The number of moles of `CH3COO-` formed is equal to the initial moles of `CH3COOH`, which is `0.0010 mol`.\n    *   Concentration of `CH3COO-`: `[CH3COO-] = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M`\n    *   The `CH3COO-` ion (a weak base) hydrolyzes in water: `CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-`\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, `Kb`, for this reaction.\n    *   `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) = 5.405 x 10^-10`\n    *   We can set up an ICE table to find the `[OH-]` concentration. Let `x = [OH-]`.\n    *   `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)`\n    *   Since `Kb` is very small, we can assume `0.020 - x ≈ 0.020`.\n    *   `5.405 x 10^-10 ≈ x² / 0.020`\n    *   `x² ≈ (5.405 x 10^-10) * (0.020) = 1.081 x 10^-11`\n    *   `x = [OH-] ≈ sqrt(1.081 x 10^-11) = 3.288 x 10^-6 M`\n    *   Now, calculate `pOH`: `pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) = 5.483`\n    *   Finally, calculate `pH`: `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517`\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
