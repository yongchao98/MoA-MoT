A correct identification of each product is essential.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and well-established reaction. All candidate answers correctly identify this product.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the most critical step in the sequence. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** For cyclic ketones, this rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after implicit acidic workup). The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize this is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction but a specific named rearrangement that alters the carbon skeleton. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard laboratory procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a straightforward functional group transformation. All candidate answers agree.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Analysis:** This step involves the reduction of the acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** The reagent, Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Using a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ would have resulted in an alcohol. All candidate answers correctly identified the selectivity of this reagent.\n\n**Conclusion on Product Identity:** There is unanimous agreement that the final product (Product 4) is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This is because C1 is a stereocenter, making the two faces of the C2-H and C5-H bonds different. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each. (2 types)\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent, and the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each. (2 types)\n\n### **Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. All candidate answers correctly performed this analysis and arrived at the number 6.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 7\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the chemical problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step organic synthesis. Correctly identifying the product of each step is essential.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. For cyclic ketones like this, the mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then opens to produce a contracted ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.** A common mistake would be to assume a simple elimination or substitution reaction, but the conditions are classic for this specific rearrangement.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis* and one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Matching this result with the given options:\nA) 10\nB) 8\nC) 7\nD) 6\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem involves a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and a verification of the underlying chemical principles.\n\n**1. Consensus Analysis of the Reaction Pathway:**\nFirst, I will examine all 15 candidate answers to find the consensus on the chemical reaction sequence.\n*   **Step 1:** Cyclohexanone + Br₂. All agents correctly identify this as an α-halogenation, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n*   **Step 2:** 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH/heat. This is the most critical step. All agents correctly identify this as a **Favorskii rearrangement**, a reaction known for causing ring contraction in cyclic α-halo ketones. The unanimous conclusion is that the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**. This high level of agreement on a complex reaction is a strong indicator of correctness.\n*   **Step 3:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/pyridine. All agents agree this is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an **acyl chloride**, yielding **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n*   **Step 4:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃. All agents correctly identify this reagent as a mild, selective reducing agent that converts an acyl chloride to an **aldehyde**, stopping the reaction before further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is unanimously identified as **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Consensus Analysis of the Structural Question:**\nThe core question is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Symmetry:** All agents correctly identify that the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C1 carbon of the ring.\n*   **Counting Hydrogens:** All agents follow the same logical breakdown:\n    1.  The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  The proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1) is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, but the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic** (not equivalent to each other). This gives 2 more distinct types.\n    4.  The protons on C3 and C4 are also equivalent by symmetry, and the protons on each are also diastereotopic. This gives another 2 distinct types.\n*   **Total Count:** The calculation is consistently 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is the key reaction. Misidentifying this would lead to an incorrect final product. The consensus is strong that this occurs, leading to ring contraction.\n*   **Selective Reduction:** The choice of reducing agent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is crucial. A stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ would have reduced the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol, changing the final product and the hydrogen count.\n*   **Symmetry and Diastereotopicity:** A simple count of hydrogens on each carbon is insufficient. The molecular symmetry and the concept of diastereotopic protons (protons on the same carbon that are in different chemical environments) are essential for the correct count.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical analysis is robust and consistent across all provided answers. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The task is now to match this number to the options provided in the prompt: A) 7, B) 8, C) 10, D) 6.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis. To find the final product, we must correctly identify the outcome of each reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The reaction introduces a single bromine atom at the α-position.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereotopicity):** Protons on a CH₂ group can be chemically non-equivalent if they have different spatial relationships to a stereocenter or a prochiral center in the molecule.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and one is *trans*. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set.

The identity of the final product depends on correctly identifying the outcome of each reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** α-Halogenation of a ketone.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a substitution reaction on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group), not an addition reaction to the C=O double bond.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (and an available α'-proton) triggers a rearrangement that results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group. This is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and reliable laboratory procedure. The thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike stronger reagents such as LiAlH₄ (which would produce an alcohol), it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to the aldehyde stage and stops.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the Final Product's Structure**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This symmetry makes the carbons on the left side of the plane equivalent to the carbons on the right side (C2 is equivalent to C5; C3 is equivalent to C4).\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd** distinct type.\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. They are not chemically equivalent because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2** more distinct types.\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. This results in another **2** distinct types.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently shows that the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction sets up the substrate for the subsequent key rearrangement.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic ketone intermediate, which then undergoes ring-opening with the strong base, resulting in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after acidic workup, which is implied).\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard and efficient laboratory method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Careful Point:** Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction, driving it to completion.\n\n### **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a selective reduction.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is crucial. A strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol. However, Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and milder reducing agent, which is well-known for stopping the reduction of an acyl chloride at the aldehyde stage.\n\n### **Step 5: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   **Analysis:** To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.

Determining the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** α-Halogenation of a ketone.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The reaction occurs at the α-carbon, the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered cyclopentane ring derivative.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and reliable method for activating a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. It selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing the over-reduction that would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent chemical environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider that hydrogens on the same carbon atom are not necessarily equivalent. If they have different spatial relationships to other parts of the molecule, they are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This is because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and one is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n**Matching with Options**\n\nThe calculated number is 6. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 6\nD) 7\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem involves a four-step organic synthesis followed by a structural analysis of the final product. The key is to correctly identify the product of each reaction and then analyze its symmetry.\n\n**1. Determining the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone, where a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. For cyclic ketones like this, the rearrangement results in a ring contraction. A common mistake would be to assume a simple elimination or substitution reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is crucial. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. It selectively reduces highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol, which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*, one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Matching this result with the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 7\nD) 6\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe reaction sequence must be analyzed step-by-step to correctly identify the final product.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    This is an acid- or base-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a substitution at the α-carbon, not an addition across the C=O double bond.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    This reaction involves an α-halo ketone treated with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. Instead of a simple substitution or elimination, the reaction proceeds through a bicyclic intermediate, resulting in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The -OH group of the acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    This reagent, often abbreviated as LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Unlike the more powerful reducing agent LiAlH₄, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to rapid conformational flipping of the cyclopentane ring at room temperature, the molecule has an *effective* plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is bonded to a carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other because they have a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*-like, the other is *trans*-like). The two *cis* protons are equivalent, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n*   **Final Count:**\n    Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

A correct identification of each product is essential.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the α-carbon) is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and well-established reaction.

The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** For cyclic ketones, this rearrangement results in a ring contraction.

It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Using a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ would have resulted in an alcohol. All candidate answers correctly identified the selectivity of this reagent.\n\n**Conclusion on Product Identity:** There is unanimous agreement that the final product (Product 4) is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This is because C1 is a stereocenter, making the two faces of the C2-H and C5-H bonds different. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each.

Correctly identifying the product of each step is essential.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. For cyclic ketones like this, the mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then opens to produce a contracted ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.** A common mistake would be to assume a simple elimination or substitution reaction, but the conditions are classic for this specific rearrangement.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl.

This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis* and one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set.

Consensus Analysis of the Reaction Pathway:**\nFirst, I will examine all 15 candidate answers to find the consensus on the chemical reaction sequence.\n*   **Step 1:** Cyclohexanone + Br₂. All agents correctly identify this as an α-halogenation, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n*   **Step 2:** 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH/heat. This is the most critical step. All agents correctly identify this as a **Favorskii rearrangement**, a reaction known for causing ring contraction in cyclic α-halo ketones. The unanimous conclusion is that the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**. This high level of agreement on a complex reaction is a strong indicator of correctness.\n*   **Step 3:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/pyridine. All agents agree this is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an **acyl chloride**, yielding **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n*   **Step 4:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃. All agents correctly identify this reagent as a mild, selective reducing agent that converts an acyl chloride to an **aldehyde**, stopping the reaction before further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is unanimously identified as **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Consensus Analysis of the Structural Question:**\nThe core question is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Symmetry:** All agents correctly identify that the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C1 carbon of the ring.\n*   **Counting Hydrogens:** All agents follow the same logical breakdown:\n    1.  The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  The proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1) is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, but the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic** (not equivalent to each other). This gives 2 more distinct types.\n    4.  The protons on C3 and C4 are also equivalent by symmetry, and the protons on each are also diastereotopic. This gives another 2 distinct types.\n*   **Total Count:** The calculation is consistently 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is the key reaction. Misidentifying this would lead to an incorrect final product. The consensus is strong that this occurs, leading to ring contraction.\n*   **Selective Reduction:** The choice of reducing agent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is crucial. A stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ would have reduced the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol, changing the final product and the hydrogen count.\n*   **Symmetry and Diastereotopicity:** A simple count of hydrogens on each carbon is insufficient. The molecular symmetry and the concept of diastereotopic protons (protons on the same carbon that are in different chemical environments) are essential for the correct count.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nThe chemical analysis is robust and consistent across all provided answers. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The task is now to match this number to the options provided in the prompt: A) 7, B) 8, C) 10, D) 6.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis. To find the final product, we must correctly identify the outcome of each reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The reaction introduces a single bromine atom at the α-position.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical step. The reaction mechanism involves a ring contraction. A common mistake would be to predict a simple elimination or substitution reaction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a straightforward functional group transformation.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   **Analysis:** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of this specific reagent is important. A stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ stops the reaction at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, attached to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis* and one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n**4.

A correct identification of each product is essential to determine the final structure.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone.

For cyclic ketones, it results in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group (after acidic workup, which is implied).\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a selective reduction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is critical. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol (which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Part 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogen atoms are in non-equivalent chemical environments and would produce separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). On the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the bond on the opposite side of the ring (the C3-C4 bond).\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, attached to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. They are not chemically equivalent to each other because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 are divided into two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of two equivalent hydrogens each.

Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike stronger agents (like LiAlH₄), it reduces acyl chlorides to **aldehydes** and stops the reaction at that stage, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.

The identity of the final product depends on correctly identifying the outcome of each reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction:** α-Halogenation of a ketone.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a substitution reaction on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group), not an addition reaction to the C=O double bond.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (and an available α'-proton) triggers a rearrangement that results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group. This is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and reliable laboratory procedure.

Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike stronger reagents such as LiAlH₄ (which would produce an alcohol), it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to the aldehyde stage and stops.\n\n### **Part 2: Analysis of the Final Product's Structure**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.

This is **1** distinct type.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd** distinct type.\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. They are not chemically equivalent because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction sets up the substrate for the subsequent key rearrangement.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction occurs with α-halo ketones that have an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation in the sequence. The mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic ketone intermediate, which then undergoes ring-opening with the strong base, resulting in a **ring contraction**. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid functional group (after acidic workup, which is implied).\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard and efficient laboratory method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Careful Point:** Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction, driving it to completion.\n\n### **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a selective reduction.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point:** The choice of the reducing agent is crucial. A strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol. However, Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and milder reducing agent, which is well-known for stopping the reduction of an acyl chloride at the aldehyde stage.\n\n### **Step 5: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   **Analysis:** To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.

The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** One must recognize these specific conditions and not mistake the reaction for a simple substitution or elimination.

Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. Unlike a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄ (which would produce an alcohol), it selectively reduces acyl chlorides to the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    *   **Product 2:** For cyclic ketones, this rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize these specific conditions for the Favorskii rearrangement. A simple elimination or substitution reaction would lead to an incorrect pathway.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct, driving the reaction to completion.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction.\n    *   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key.

This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is bonded to a carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other because they have a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*-like, the other is *trans*-like). The two *cis* protons are equivalent, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent, but the two protons on each carbon are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n*   **Final Count:**\n    Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) 10\nB) 7\nC) 8\nD) 6\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
