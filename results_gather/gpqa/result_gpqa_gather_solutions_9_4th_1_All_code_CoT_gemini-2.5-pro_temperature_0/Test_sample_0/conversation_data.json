This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely one can know both a state's energy and its lifetime simultaneously.\n\n### **2. State the Formula**\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving the lifetime (τ) of a state, the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as the natural linewidth, can be approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the \"width\" of the energy level).\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.

Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision of its energy. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely one can know both a state's energy and its lifetime simultaneously.\n\n### **2. State the Formula**\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving the lifetime (τ) of a state, the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as the natural linewidth, can be approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the \"width\" of the energy level).\n*   **τ** is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**. Using this value allows for a direct calculation of the energy width in electron-volts (eV), which matches the units of the options.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\nA shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"smeared out\" energy level. We will calculate this energy width for both states. The provided code output confirms these calculations:\n\n*   **Energy width for state 1 (τ = 1.0e-09 s): ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582e-07 eV**\n*   **Energy width for state 2 (τ = 1.0e-08 s): ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582e-08 eV**\n\n### **4. Determine the Condition for Resolution and Evaluate Options**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" the two levels, their energy separation must be greater than the larger of these two widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width, which is the limiting factor.\n\n**Resolution Condition:** |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nThe code output confirms the evaluation of the options against this condition:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

(Not resolvable)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship**: The most critical concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime (τ) and its energy uncertainty (ΔE). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger, more \"smeared out\" energy level.\n2.  **The Limiting Factor**: Resolution is always limited by the broader of the two energy levels, which corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s in this case). The energy separation must be greater than this larger width.\n3.  **\"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies the energy separation should be significantly larger than the energy width, so their energy distributions do not significantly overlap. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 1,500 times larger than the limiting energy width, satisfying this condition unambiguously.\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical result of **10⁻⁴ eV**.

In this case, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown and final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem is solved using the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is inherently \"smeared\" over a range (ΔE), known as the energy width or natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The relationship is approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy width in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   τ is the lifetime of the state in seconds (s).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We must calculate the energy width for both states. A shorter lifetime results in a larger energy width.\n    *   **State 1**: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the **shorter lifetime** (State 1) has the **larger energy width** (ΔE₁), which is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the condition for resolution is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare each given option to this required minimum energy difference.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.** (Resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The most critical concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime (τ) and its energy uncertainty (ΔE). A shorter lifetime leads to a broader, more uncertain energy level.\n*   **The Limiting Factor**: Resolution is always limited by the broader of the two energy levels, which corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s). The energy separation must be greater than this larger width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **Meaning of \"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies the energy separation should be significantly larger than the energy widths, so their energy distributions do not significantly overlap. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 1,500 times larger than the limiting energy width, satisfying this condition unambiguously.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers**: The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical result (10⁻⁴ eV). The variation in the final lettered choice (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of the options being presented to the agents in different random orders. The correct procedure is to ignore the letters from the candidate answers and map the unanimously agreed-upon numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) to the option list provided in the original question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be known. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving a state's lifetime (τ), the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as the natural linewidth, can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: A finite lifetime implies that the energy level is not perfectly sharp but is \"smeared\" over a range ΔE.
