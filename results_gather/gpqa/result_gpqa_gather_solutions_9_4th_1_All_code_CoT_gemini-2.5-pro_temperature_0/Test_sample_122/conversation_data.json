The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual responses, but the numerical result is unanimous. Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis and conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta's velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is 0.2, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is given as 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   Calculate the numerator (the non-relativistic distance):\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the denominator (the relativistic correction factor):\n        `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Calculate the final distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the original question:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Classical Trap**: A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n2.  **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is correctly identifying that the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time (`Δt₀`). If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be 3,000,000 km.\n3.  **Logical Sanity Check**: Time *dilation* means that time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple logical check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as the plausible answer.\n4.  **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: A mistake in applying the formula, such as multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance *shorter* than 3,000,000 km (specifically, `~2,940,000 km`, which is option C). This is physically incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution and a summary of the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The velocity of the ejecta is `v = 60,000 km/s`. Given the speed of light `c` is approximately `300,000 km/s`, the ejecta's speed is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of Special Relativity are significant and must be considered. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time measured in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is designated as the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is the product of the velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   Calculate the numerator, which represents the classical distance (ignoring relativity):\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic correction factor in the denominator:\n        `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Calculate the final distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option C. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. If the time had been measured in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be 3,000,000 km.\n*   **The Logical Check**: Time *dilation* means that from the Galaxy's perspective, more time passes than the 50 seconds measured on the ejecta's clock. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as the plausible answer.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: A mistake in applying the formula, such as multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance *shorter* than 3,000,000 km (specifically, `~2,940,000 km`, which is option A). This is physically incorrect as the Lorentz factor `γ` must be greater than or equal to 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. All the candidate answers correctly identify this as the necessary physical principle. The main discrepancy among them is the inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options. I will ignore their option lists and refer only to the one provided in the original question.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Variables and Physical Principles**: I will define the velocity (`v`), the proper time (`t_proper`), and the speed of light (`c`). I will state that because the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), time dilation must be used.\n2.  **Perform a Logical Check**: I will first calculate the \"classical\" distance, which ignores relativity. According to time dilation, the time elapsed in the stationary (Galaxy) frame is longer than the proper time, so the actual distance must be *greater* than this classical distance. This allows for a quick sanity check of the options.\n3.  **Execute the Precise Relativistic Calculation**: I will use the full time dilation formula to calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated result to the options provided in the original question to determine the final answer.

The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is 0.2, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high speed, the effects of special relativity cannot be ignored. The key concept that applies here is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time measured in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is the product of the velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the numerator, which represents the classical distance if relativity were ignored:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the denominator, which is the relativistic correction factor:\n        `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   The value of `√0.96` is approximately `0.9798`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the relativistic distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

An analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the physical method and calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta's velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is 0.2, or 20%. At such a high speed, the effects of special relativity are significant and must be used. The key concept is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame (the ejecta's clock).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the numerator, which represents the classical distance if relativity were ignored:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic correction factor in the denominator:\n        `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the actual distance by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option B. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is recognizing that the 50-second interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would have been 3,000,000 km.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: Time *dilation* means that from the Galaxy's perspective, more time passes than the 50 seconds experienced by the ejecta. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as the plausible answer.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: The Lorentz factor `γ` is always greater than or equal to 1. A calculation error, such as multiplying by `√0.96` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a physically incorrect distance less than 3,000,000 km (specifically, ~2,940,000 km, which is option C).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the physical principles, the formula, and the numerical result. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choice are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in the source materials, but the underlying physics is sound and points to a single correct value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta is moving at `v = 60,000 km/s`. Given the speed of light `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`, the ejecta's velocity is 20% of the speed of light (`v/c = 0.2`). At such a significant fraction of the speed of light, the effects of special relativity cannot be ignored. The key principle required to solve the problem is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is designated as the \"proper time\" because it is the time interval measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame (the ejecta's clock).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) measured in the Galaxy's frame is the product of the ejecta's velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   By combining these formulas, we can directly calculate the distance `d`:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic distance, which forms the numerator of the equation:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic correction factor, which is the denominator:\n        `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   The value of `√0.96` is approximately `0.9798`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the relativistic distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

Confusing this with the time in the stationary frame is a common and fundamental error.\n*   **The Classical Trap**: A non-relativistic calculation would simply be `distance = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. This approach is incorrect because it ignores the significant relativistic effects.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: The principle of time *dilation* means that time in the stationary (Galaxy) frame passes more quickly than in the moving (ejecta) frame (`Δt > Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as the plausible answer even before a full calculation is performed.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: The Lorentz factor `γ` is always greater than or equal to 1. This means the calculation involves dividing by `√(1 - v²/c²)`, which is a number less than 1, thus increasing the final distance.

If the time had been measured in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be 3,000,000 km.\n*   **The Logical Check**: Time *dilation* means that from the Galaxy's perspective, more time passes than the 50 seconds measured on the ejecta's clock. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as the plausible answer.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: A mistake in applying the formula, such as multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance *shorter* than 3,000,000 km (specifically, `~2,940,000 km`, which is option A).

If this were mistaken for the time in the Galaxy's frame, the conclusion would be incorrect.\n*   **The Classical Trap**: A common error is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This yields `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option B. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **The Logical Sanity Check**: Time *dilation* means that from the Galaxy's perspective, more than 50 seconds have passed. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, leaving only D as the plausible answer even before a full calculation.\n*   **Incorrect Application of the Lorentz Factor**: Another potential error is to incorrectly multiply by the `√(1 - v²/c²)` term instead of dividing.

The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   By combining these formulas, we can directly calculate the distance `d`:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic distance, which forms the numerator of the equation:\n        `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the relativistic correction factor, which is the denominator:\n        `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   The value of `√0.96` is approximately `0.9798`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the relativistic distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step in solving this problem is correctly identifying that the 50-second interval is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame. Confusing this with the time in the stationary frame is a common and fundamental error.\n*   **The Classical Trap**: A non-relativistic calculation would simply be `distance = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option B. This approach is incorrect because it ignores the significant relativistic effects.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check**: The principle of time *dilation* means that time in the stationary (Galaxy) frame passes more quickly than in the moving (ejecta) frame (`Δt > Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple check immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving only A as the plausible answer even before a full calculation is performed.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: The Lorentz factor `γ` is always greater than or equal to 1. This means the calculation involves dividing by `√(1 - v²/c²)`, which is a number less than 1, thus increasing the final distance. An incorrect application, such as multiplying by this factor, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a physically incorrect distance less than 3,000,000 km (specifically, option D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, all of them correctly identify the physical principles and perform the correct calculation, even if the final lettered choice varies due to inconsistent option labeling in their individual responses. The consensus on the method and numerical result is unanimous.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The ejecta's velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`. The ratio `v/c` is 0.2, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity are significant and cannot be ignored. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference and Given Information**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`)**: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame (the ejecta's clock).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**:\n    *   The distance (`d`) measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`): `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Combining these formulas gives the complete expression for the distance: `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   Calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator): `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic correction factor (the denominator): `√(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`.\n    *   Calculate the final distance: `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**:\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Classical Trap**: A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n2.  **Identifying Proper Time**: The most critical step is correctly identifying that the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time (`Δt₀`). If the problem had stated that 50 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame, the answer would simply be the classical distance (Option D).\n3.  **Logical Check (Direction of the Effect)**: Time *dilation* means that time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than the proper time (`Δt₀`). Therefore, the distance measured in the stationary frame (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. This simple logical check immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as the plausible answer.\n4.  **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor**: A mistake in applying the formula, such as multiplying by `√(1 - v²/c²)` instead of dividing, would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance *shorter* than 3,000,000 km (specifically, `~2,940,000 km`, which is option C). This is physically incorrect as the Lorentz factor `γ` must be greater than or equal to 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
