    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during an electrophilic substitution reaction (bromination), we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituent already present on the benzene ring determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) will add. Substituents are classified as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **Categorize the substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho-, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups) or halogens. In this list:\n        *   `-CH3` (in Toluene, 1) - Activating\n        *   `-C2H5` (in Ethylbenzene, 5) - Activating\n        *   `-Cl` (in Chlorobenzene, 3) - Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing\n    *   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. They are deactivating groups. In this list:\n        *   `-NO2` (in Nitrobenzene, 4) - Strongly deactivating\n        *   `-COOH` (in Benzoic acid, 6) - Deactivating\n        *   `-COOC2H5` (in Ethyl benzoate, 2) - Deactivating\n\n2.  **Analyze the meta-directors (substances 2, 4, 6):**\n    These substances will produce very little para-isomer, as the substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position. The amount of para-product will be the lowest for the most strongly deactivating group, which is the most meta-selective. The order of deactivating strength (and thus meta-selectivity) is:\n    `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`\n    Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for nitrobenzene, followed by benzoic acid, and then ethyl benzoate. Bromination of nitrobenzene gives almost exclusively the meta product. The ester group in ethyl benzoate is slightly less deactivating than the carboxylic acid group, leading to a marginally higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Yield order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n3.  **Analyze the ortho-, para-directors (substances 1, 3, 5):**\n    These substances will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho isomer is influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3)**: The methyl group is relatively small. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products, with the para isomer being favored. Typical yields are around 62-67% for the para isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5)**: The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl)**: Halogens are deactivating but ortho-, para-directing. Due to a combination of steric and electronic factors, bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para isomer, often around 89%.\n    Comparing the para-isomer yields for this group:\n    *   Yield order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n4.  **Combine the rankings:**\n    The meta-directors will have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directors.\n    *   Combined Order: (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    *   The final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n        **4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
