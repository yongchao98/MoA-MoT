    "To identify the unknown compound, we will analyze the data from each characterisation technique:\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly indicative of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas:\n\nBased on the spectroscopic evidence, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms, and at least one carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   A **carboxylic acid** contains one C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).\n*   An **alkene** contains one C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of at least 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, and N is nitrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen atom, also contradicting the carboxylic acid evidence.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O in the carboxylic acid but not for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll the provided spectral data are consistent with a molecule that is a six-carbon unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains the necessary two oxygen atoms and has the correct degree of unsaturation to account for both a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
