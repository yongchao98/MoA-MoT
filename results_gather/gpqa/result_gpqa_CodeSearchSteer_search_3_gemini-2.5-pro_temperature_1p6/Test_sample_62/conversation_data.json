    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n### 1. Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The energy for a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n*   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n### 2. Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   **E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω**\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For an infrared rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (J=0), the rotational quantum number can only increase, so the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the final state is `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n    *   **E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 3. Energy and Momentum of the Photon\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **ΔE = E_final - E_initial**\n*   **ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c` ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s) by the equation `E = pc`. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n\n*   **p = ΔE / c = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c**\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   M_x = 20 amu\n*   M_y = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (μ)**\nThe reduced mass is the effective inertial mass in a two-body system.\nμ = (M_x * M_y) / (M_x + M_y)\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)**\nThe moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR².\nI = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²)\nI ≈ 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)**\n*   First term (vibrational energy): ħω\n    *   ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Second term (rotational energy): ħ²/I\n    *   ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    *   ħ²/I ≈ (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   Total energy difference:\n    *   ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.20 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the photon's momentum (p)**\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n**p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
