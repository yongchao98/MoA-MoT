    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n\nWhen cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, an α-bromination reaction occurs, where a bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on one of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n\nHeating an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) typically leads to a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide, which opens the ring. The result is a ring contraction, converting the six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (present as its sodium salt, sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate, in the basic solution).\n\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (after acidic workup, which is implicit before the next step).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in the presence of pyridine to convert the carboxylic acid functional group into an acyl chloride. This is a standard and efficient method for this transformation.\n\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n### **Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      H\n      |\n    O=C\n      |\nH(a)-C1\n    /  \\\nH(b,c)-C2--C5-H(h,i)\n     |    |\nH(d,e)-C3--C4-H(f,g)\n```\nThere are a total of 10 hydrogens in the molecule (C₆H₁₀O). We must determine how many of these are in unique chemical environments.\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO)**: This hydrogen is unique. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **The proton on C1**: The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the hydrogen, the aldehyde group, C2, and C5, is a chiral center. The proton attached to this chiral center is in a unique environment. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **Protons on the ring carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5)**: Because C1 is a stereocenter, the entire molecule is chiral. In a chiral molecule, there are no simple planes of symmetry that would make the protons on the ring equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5**: These positions are adjacent to the chiral center but are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic to each other, and the two hydrogens on C5 are also diastereotopic. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 represent four distinct types of hydrogen. (4 distinct types)\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, C3 and C4 are not equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, and the two hydrogens on C4 are also diastereotopic. This gives another four distinct types of hydrogen. (4 distinct types)\n\nCounting all the distinct hydrogen types:\n*   1 (aldehyde H)\n*   1 (H on C1)\n*   2 (diastereotopic Hs on C2)\n*   2 (diastereotopic Hs on C3)\n*   2 (diastereotopic Hs on C4)\n*   2 (diastereotopic Hs on C5)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Barring any accidental overlap in a real spectrum (accidental isochrony), each of these ten protons is chemically unique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
