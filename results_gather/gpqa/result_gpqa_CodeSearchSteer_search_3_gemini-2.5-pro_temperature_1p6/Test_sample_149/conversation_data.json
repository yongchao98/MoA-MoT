    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees and a carbonyl group (C=O) from an aldehyde accounts for another, totaling 5.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. This gives us the fragment `-CH2-CHO`.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nCombining these pieces—a p-aminophenyl group and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO)—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**: This set of reagents is used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**: Treating the arenediazonium salt with water replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol. The intermediate product at this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**: This step involves a base (KOH) and heat, which promotes a self-condensation reaction of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde called an aldol adduct. In this case, the adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Dehydration:** The presence of heat strongly suggests that the aldol adduct will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is favored because it results in a highly stable, conjugated system. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated to form a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\nThe final product after dehydration is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to Option B.\n\n\n\n<<<B>>>"
