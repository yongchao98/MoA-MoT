    "This question requires analyzing the difference between the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the mean free path of electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1):** In a gas, all molecules are in constant, random motion. When calculating the mean free path, we must consider the relative speed between the colliding molecules, not just the speed of a single molecule. This consideration introduces a factor of the square root of 2 (√2) into the denominator of the standard formula. The formula is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ)\n    where 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules and 'σ' is the collision cross-section of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2):** In this case, a beam of very fast electrons is traveling through a gas. The electrons are moving at such a high velocity (accelerated by 1000 kV) that the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The formula for the mean free path of a particle in a field of stationary targets is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where 'n' is the number density and 'σ' is the collision cross-section, which is primarily determined by the size of the gas molecule, as the electron's size is negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the two equations, we can see the relationship between λ2 and λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ)] = √2\n\nTherefore, λ2 = √2 * λ1.\n\nSince √2 is approximately 1.414, we can evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 -> Incorrect.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> Correct, as 1.414 is greater than 1.22.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect.\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect, as 1.414 is not less than 1.22.\n\nThe mean free path of electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules scattering off each other (λ1) by a factor of approximately 1.414.\n\n<<<B>>>"
