    "The chemist's lament, \"my compounds are on top of each other,\" almost certainly refers to a failed attempt at separation using chromatography.\n\nIn synthetic organic chemistry, the most common method for purifying reaction mixtures is chromatography, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. Both techniques separate compounds based on their differential interactions with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This interaction is primarily governed by polarity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why B is the correct answer:\n\n*   **Similar Polarities:** Compounds with very similar polarities will have similar affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. This means they will travel through the chromatography system at nearly the same rate, a phenomenon known as co-elution. On a TLC plate, which is a common way to quickly analyze a reaction's progress, this results in spots that do not separate and appear as one large, overlapping spotâ€”literally \"on top of each other.\" Trying to separate such compounds with column chromatography is also challenging and often results in poor purification.\n\nThe other options are less likely for the following reasons:\n\n*   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is measured on a pure sample. It is not a technique used for separating bulk mixtures in a typical synthetic lab setting, and similar values would not prevent separation by other means like chromatography.\n*   **C) Similar boiling points:** While similar boiling points are problematic for separation by distillation, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of overlapping spots on a TLC plate or co-eluting bands from a column. Chromatography is generally a more common purification method than distillation in a synthetic organic lab unless dealing with large quantities of volatile liquids.\n*   **D) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these forces are the underlying physical reason for properties like polarity, this option is too general. It is the *similarity* of these interactions (which manifests as similar polarity) that causes the separation problem, not the mere existence of the interactions themselves.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is expressing frustration that a chromatographic separation has failed because the compounds of interest have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
