    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Volume and Number of Stars**: Consider a sphere of radius 'd' with the observer at the center. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the total number of stars (N) within this distance 'd' is proportional to the volume.\n    *   `N ∝ V`\n    *   `N ∝ d³`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This relationship is given by the formula `d = 1/plx`. More distant stars have a smaller parallax angle.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax**: By substituting the distance-parallax relationship into our expression for the number of stars, we can find the total number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value `plx`.\n    *   Since `N ∝ d³` and `d = 1/plx`, it follows that:\n    *   `N ∝ (1/plx)³ = 1/plx³`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes. This is equivalent to finding the derivative of the number of stars N with respect to parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n\n    To find this, consider a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + Δd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`ΔV`) is approximately the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness (`Δd`).\n    *   `ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd`\n    *   The number of stars (`ΔN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell: `ΔN = ρ * ΔV ≈ ρ * 4πd² * Δd`.\n\n    Now, we need to express this in terms of parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The change in distance (`Δd`) corresponding to a small change in parallax (`Δ(plx)`) is found by differentiation: `Δd/Δ(plx) ≈ d(d)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`. We are interested in the magnitude, so we take `|Δd| = (1/plx²) * |Δ(plx)|`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `Δd` into the equation for `ΔN`:\n    *   `ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * Δ(plx)`\n    *   `ΔN ≈ (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * Δ(plx)`\n\n    To find the number of stars per unit parallax, we divide by `Δ(plx)`:\n    *   `ΔN/Δ(plx) ≈ ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Therefore, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis shows that under the assumption of a uniform spatial distribution, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
