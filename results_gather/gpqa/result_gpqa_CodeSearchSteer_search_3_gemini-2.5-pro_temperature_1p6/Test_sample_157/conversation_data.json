    "A dominant-negative mutation creates a mutant protein that disrupts the function of the wild-type protein from the other allele. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to become active. The Y mutation is in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the likely molecular events:\n*   **Dimer Formation:** The cell produces both wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y) protein subunits. Because the mutation is a missense mutation in the dimerization domain and not a complete deletion, it's likely that mutant Y subunits can still dimerize with wild-type subunits, forming non-functional WT-Y heterodimers.\n*   **Interference:** These non-functional WT-Y dimers effectively sequester the WT subunits, preventing them from forming functional WT-WT homodimers. This interference is the core of the dominant-negative effect: the mutant protein antagonizes the function of the wild-type protein.\n*   **Loss of Function:** Since functional WT-WT dimers cannot form in sufficient quantities, the transcription factor cannot move to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype, even though a normal wild-type allele is present.\n*   **Protein Instability and Degradation:** Missense mutations that cause a dominant-negative effect can lead to protein instability. The malformed WT-Y heterodimers may be recognized by the cell's quality control machinery as improperly folded and targeted for destruction by the proteasome. This would lead to the degradation of not only the mutant protein but also the wild-type protein trapped with it, further ensuring the loss of function.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This aligns perfectly with the mechanism described above. The dominant-negative mutation leads to a loss of function of the wild-type allele, often by creating an unstable complex that is subsequently degraded.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutant protein could not dimerize at all, it would not interfere with the wild-type protein. The WT-WT dimers would form normally, leading to a wild-type phenotype, which would make the mutation recessive, not dominant-negative.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function phenotype, the specific mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is typically interference via the formation of non-functional dimers, not necessarily large-scale aggregation.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states the mutation is dominant-*negative*, which is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype involves the loss of function of the wild-type allele, which is often mediated by the degradation of the non-functional protein complexes formed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
