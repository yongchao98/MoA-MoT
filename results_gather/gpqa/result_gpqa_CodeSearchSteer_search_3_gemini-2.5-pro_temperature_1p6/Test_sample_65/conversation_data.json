    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parametrize the effects of new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian adheres to fundamental symmetry principles.\n\nAll operators in the SMEFT must be invariant under Lorentz symmetry and the more general Poincare symmetry. Poincare invariance, which includes both translations and Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations), is a fundamental assumption in constructing the SMEFT. The operators are built from SM fields in a way that ensures they transform as scalars under Lorentz transformations, a cornerstone of quantum field theory.\n\nWhile the Standard Model itself contains a source of CP violation, the SMEFT framework allows for additional sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. In fact, the study of these CP-violating operators is an active area of research, as they could potentially explain phenomena like the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\nCPT symmetry, which is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time-reversal (T), is considered a fundamental symmetry of any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, as guaranteed by the CPT theorem. Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
