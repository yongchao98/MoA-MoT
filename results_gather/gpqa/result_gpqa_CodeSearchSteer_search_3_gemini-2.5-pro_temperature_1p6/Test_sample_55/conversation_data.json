    "A decay from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole transitions must follow specific selection rules. These rules govern the change in the quantum numbers $n$, $l$, and $m$.\n\n**Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nFor an electric dipole transition to be \"allowed\", the following changes in the orbital angular momentum quantum number ($l$) and the magnetic quantum number ($m$) must occur:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThere is no selection rule for the principal quantum number ($n$), but for spontaneous emission, the atom must transition to a state of lower energy, meaning $n$ must decrease.\n\n**Analyzing the Transition Route**\n\nThe transition occurs in two steps, starting from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and ending at the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n1.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, $l=0$, and $m=0$.\n    *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m'=0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   For the principal quantum number, the most probable transition in a cascade is to the next lowest energy level, so we consider the intermediate state to have $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, with $n=1$, $l=0$, and $m=0$.\n    *   Let's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed:\n        *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed). $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed). This transition is possible.\n        *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed). $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (allowed). This transition is possible.\n        *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (allowed). $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (allowed). This transition is possible.\n\nAll three routes are valid according to the selection rules. Options A, C, and D present these valid pathways.\n\n**Calculating the Transition Probability**\n\nThe overall probability of a specific two-step decay path is the product of the probabilities of each step (also known as branching ratios).\n\n*   **Step 1 Probability**: The decay from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s) state to the three possible $|2,1,m\\rangle$ (2p) states is equally distributed among them due to the absence of an external field to break the symmetry. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any specific m-state ($m'=1, 0, -1$) is $1/3$.\n*   **Step 2 Probability**: From any of the $|2,1,m\\rangle$ states, the only allowed decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1 for each of the intermediate states.\n\nNow we can evaluate the probabilities for the options:\n*   **Route A**: For $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the total probability is $P = P(3s \\rightarrow 2p_{m=1}) \\times P(2p_{m=1} \\rightarrow 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$. This contradicts the $\\frac{1}{4}$ in the option.\n*   **Route C**: For $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the total probability is $P = P(3s \\rightarrow 2p_{m=-1}) \\times P(2p_{m=-1} \\rightarrow 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$. This contradicts the $\\frac{1}{4}$ in the option.\n*   **Route D**: For $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the total probability is $P = P(3s \\rightarrow 2p_{m=0}) \\times P(2p_{m=0} \\rightarrow 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$. This matches the probability given in the option.\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a corresponding probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
