    "### Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting its host star by a factor of approximately 1.65.\n\nResearchers should prioritize observing Planet_1 because it has a significantly higher likelihood of transiting. The transit probability of an exoplanet is determined by the ratio of its host star's radius to the semi-major axis of its orbit. A detailed analysis reveals that Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times greater than that of Planet_2.\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet with a circular orbit transiting its star can be estimated by the formula P ≈ R_s / a, where R_s is the stellar radius and 'a' is the planet's semi-major axis. To compare the two planets, we can set up a ratio of their transit probabilities:\n\nP₁ / P₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂)\n\nGiven that the host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2), this simplifies to:\n\nP₁ / P₂ = a₂ / a₁\n\nTo find the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which connects the orbital period (T), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_s). The law is expressed as T² ∝ a³ / M_s. Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis gives a ∝ (T² * M_s)^(1/3).\n\nUsing this relationship, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (T₂² * M_s2)^(1/3) ] / [ (T₁² * M_s1)^(1/3) ]\n\nWe are given that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2 (T₁ = T₂ / 3, so T₂ / T₁ = 3) and the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, so M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2). Substituting these values into the equation:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)\na₂ / a₁ = (9)^(1/3) * (0.5)^(1/3)\na₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nSince the ratio of the transit probabilities P₁ / P₂ is equal to a₂ / a₁, the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
