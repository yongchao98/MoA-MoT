    "The search results confirm the underlying physics principles I used. Several sources (,,) reference Kepler's Third Law in the context of binary stars:\n\nP² ∝ a³ / (M₁ + M₂)\n\nWhere P is the orbital period, 'a' is the semi-major axis, and M₁ + M₂ is the total mass of the system.\n\nFor spectroscopic binaries, where the individual stars cannot be seen but their motion is detected by the Doppler shift of their spectral lines, the search results confirm that the orbital velocities and period are the key observables (,,).\n\nThe relationship between the total mass (M_total), period (P), and the sum of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K₁ + K₂) is given by:\n\nM_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since both systems are described as having eclipses, it implies an inclination angle 'i' close to 90 degrees, which means sin(i) is approximately 1 (,,). Assuming sin³(i) is the same and close to 1 for both systems, it cancels out when taking the ratio of the two masses.\n\nThe formula for the ratio of the total masses is therefore:\n\nM₁_total / M₂_total = (P₁ / P₂) * [(K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)]³\n\nWhere:\n*   M₁_total and M₂_total are the total masses of system 1 and system 2.\n*   P₁ and P₂ are the periods of system 1 and system 2.\n*   K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ, K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ are the radial velocity amplitudes for the stars in each system.\n\nThe values given in the problem are:\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio formula:\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 years / 1 year) * [ (10 km/s + 5 km/s) / (15 km/s + 10 km/s) ]³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * [ 15 / 25 ]³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * [ 3 / 5 ]³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis calculated factor of ~0.432 means that system 1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system 2.\n\nFinal calculation is confirmed and sound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
