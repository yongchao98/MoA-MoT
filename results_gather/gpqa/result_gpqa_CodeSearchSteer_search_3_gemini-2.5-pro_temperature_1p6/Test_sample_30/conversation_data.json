    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an activating group that directs the incoming nitro group (NO2) to the *ortho* and *para* positions. This results in a mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene. While more *ortho* product may form due to the two available ortho positions compared to one para position, the *para* isomer is often favored in subsequent reactions due to less steric hindrance. We will proceed assuming the major *para* isomer is carried to the next step.\n\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing a methyl group on an aromatic ring to an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. While oxidation to the carboxylic acid is possible under certain conditions, a known process is the oxidation of *p*-nitrotoluene to the corresponding aldehyde. Specifically, one source notes that oxidizing toluene with MnO2 yields primarily benzaldehyde. Another document mentions a process for oxidizing p-nitrotoluene to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. This suggests that the aldehyde is a likely product.\n\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aromatic aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) deprotonates an α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we need to identify the symmetry elements present in its most stable conformation.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a para-substituted benzene ring, a trans (E) double bond, and a ketone functional group. The extended conjugation between the nitro group, the benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group favors a planar conformation of the entire molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cn):** There are no C2, C3, or higher-order rotation axes. A C2 axis cannot pass through the N-C bond axis of the ring because the -CH=CH-CO-CH3 side chain is not symmetric.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n\nSince the only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), the molecule belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nC) cs\n<<<C>>>"
