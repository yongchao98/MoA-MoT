    "To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope, we must consider two main criteria for each star: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and its apparent brightness compared to the instrument's capabilities.\n\n### **1. Observability from Paranal Observatory**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A telescope's pointing limit is typically defined by its maximum zenith distance. For the VLT, the safety limit is a zenith distance of 70 degrees. This means the VLT can observe objects within the declination (DEC) range of approximately **+45.4° to -90°**. Objects outside this range, specifically those with a high northern declination, are not visible from Paranal.\n\n### **2. ESPRESSO's Detection Limit**\n\nThe problem states a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. According to ESO's documentation for ESPRESSO, when used with a single Unit Telescope (1-UT) in High-Resolution (HR) mode, the limiting V-band magnitude to achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour is approximately **V ≈ 17**. Therefore, any observable star with an apparent magnitude (m_V) of 17 or brighter (i.e., m_V ≤ 17) will be considered detectable.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Each Star**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability**: Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range for the VLT.\n*   **Brightness**: Its apparent visual magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. This is significantly brighter than the m_V = 17 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability**: Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89° 15'. This is far north of the VLT's +45.4° declination limit.\n*   **Brightness**: Its apparent magnitude is about +1.98.\n*   **Conclusion**: Polaris is **not detectable** because it is not visible from Paranal Observatory.\n\n**c) Star at 10 pc**\n*   **Observability**: Its declination is given as 0°, which is on the celestial equator and easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: The apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d = 10 pc) using the distance modulus formula:\n    m_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(d)\n    m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = **15.0**\n    An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the m_V = 17 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star at 200 pc**\n*   **Observability**: Its declination is 0°, making it observable.\n*   **Brightness**:\n    m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(200) ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.5 = **21.5**\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the m_V = 17 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star at 5 pc**\n*   **Observability**: Its declination is 0°, making it observable.\n*   **Brightness**:\n    m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.5 = **13.5**\n    An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the m_V = 17 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star at 50 pc**\n*   **Observability**: Its declination is 0°, making it observable.\n*   **Brightness**:\n    m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log₁₀(50) ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.5 = **18.5**\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the m_V = 17 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe following stars would be detectable:\n1.  **Canopus** (Visible and bright enough)\n2.  **Star at 10 pc** (Visible and bright enough)\n3.  **Star at 5 pc** (Visible and bright enough)\n\nIn total, 3 of the stars listed would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
