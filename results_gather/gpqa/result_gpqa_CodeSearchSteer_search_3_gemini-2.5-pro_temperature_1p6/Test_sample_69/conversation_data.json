    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify H, B, and D:**\n    The problem states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) from sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   **B** = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide, a gas)\n    *   **D** = Cl₂ (Chlorine, a gas)\n    *   **H** = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride, a liquid solvent)\n    *   Reaction 4: SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)\n\n2.  **Identify F and G:**\n    Product C reacts with water to reform solid A and produce a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), the acids must be derived from the hydrolysis of the sulfur dioxide component. Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which is a weak acid. Sulfurous acid can disproportionate, especially in the presence of other reagents, to form sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), a strong acid, and other products. Therefore, it is plausible that the hydrolysis of the SO₂-containing compound C yields both acids.\n    *   **G** = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid)\n    *   **F** = H₂SO₄ (Sulfuric acid, a strong acid)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A(s) + H₂SO₄ + H₂SO₃. The reformation of solid A indicates that A is likely a metal or element acting as a central core for the complex C, which is released upon hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Characterize C and A:**\n    Product C is formed from solid A and 8 equivalents of gas B (SO₂). It is described as a bright red product.\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8SO₂(g) → C(bright red).\n    While the exact identity of A and C is difficult to determine without knowledge of very specific or obscure reactions, we have established that C is a complex of A with sulfur dioxide, likely having a formula of A(SO₂)₈.\n\n4.  **Identify E and its Molecular Symmetry:**\n    Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl₂). E is described as an extremely hazardous product.\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2Cl₂(g) → E\n    Given that C is a complex of A and SO₂, and it reacts with chlorine, a likely reaction is the chlorination of the SO₂ ligands to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which we already identified as compound H. Sulfuryl chloride is indeed a hazardous substance; it is toxic, corrosive, and reacts violently with water. Thus, it is highly probable that E is SO₂Cl₂.\n    *   **E** = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    The final step is to determine the molecular geometry and point group of sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂).\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The geometry is tetrahedral around the sulfur atom.\n    *   The molecule possesses a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that bisects the O-S-O and Cl-S-Cl angles.\n    *   It also has two perpendicular planes of symmetry (σᵥ). One plane contains the Cl-S-Cl atoms, and the other contains the O-S-O atoms.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<C>>>"
