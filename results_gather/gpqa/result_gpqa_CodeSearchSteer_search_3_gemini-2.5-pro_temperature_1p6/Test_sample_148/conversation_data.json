    "The observations provided strongly indicate that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. Here is a breakdown of the evidence and why it supports this conclusion over the other options.\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n*   **NMR Spectrum:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which do not arise from spin-spin coupling, suggests the existence of two different chemical environments for that proton.\n    *   **Enantiomers**, which are mirror images, have identical NMR spectra in a standard achiral solvent and would only show one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, have different physical and chemical properties. This difference in structure creates a different electronic environment around the alpha-proton for each diastereomer, leading to two distinct signals in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Rotamers** (conformational isomers, often around an amide bond) can also cause peak doubling. However, the energy barrier for rotation is often low enough that these peaks broaden and coalesce into a single average peak at elevated temperatures.\n\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks with equal intensity, while the mass spectrometry (MS) shows both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   This rules out **contamination with a precursor** (Option A) or a major side-product like a **'double coupling' product** (Option D), as these would almost certainly have different masses.\n    *   **Enantiomers** are not separable on a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute together as a single peak. Separating them requires a specialized chiral column.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, due to their different physical properties, can often be separated on standard achiral LC columns. The observation of two separate peaks is a classic sign of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n*   **Elevated Temperature:** The fact that the two peaks remain clearly defined in the LC-MS at elevated temperature is a key piece of information. This suggests that the two species are stable and do not interconvert easily, which would be expected for diastereomers (which require breaking a covalent bond to interconvert). This makes the possibility of them being rotamers much less likely, as rotamers would be expected to interconvert rapidly and coalesce at higher temperatures.\n\n*   **Source of Diastereomers:** In chemical peptide synthesis, it is a known issue that an amino acid can undergo epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) under certain reaction conditions. If one of the chiral amino acids in the peptide chain epimerizes, the result will be a mixture of two diastereomers. For example, if an L-amino acid is coupled to another L-amino acid that has partially epimerized to its D-form, the product will be a mixture of L-L and L-D peptides, which are diastereomers. The roughly equal integrals in the NMR and intensities in the LC-MS suggest this epimerization occurred to a significant extent, approaching a 1:1 mixture.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined NMR and LC-MS evidence, particularly the distinguishability by standard NMR and achiral LC and the stability at elevated temperature, the most likely explanation is the presence of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<B>>>"
