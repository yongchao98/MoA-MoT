    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe given state of the system is the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\nIn quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized. First, we find the square of the norm of `|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Operator P with Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. The eigenvector equation is `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`. For `λ=0`, this becomes `P|v⟩ = 0`.\nLet `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n\nThis yields the system of linear equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. To normalize this eigenvector, we set its norm to 1:\n`x^2 + 0^2 + (-x)^2 = 1`\n`2x^2 = 1` ⇒ `x = 1/√2`.\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n`|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector for the Operator Q with Eigenvalue -1**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nThe eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`. This vector is already normalized.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of the Sequence of Measurements**\n\nThe process involves two sequential measurements: first P, then Q.\n\n**Step 4a: Probability of measuring P = 0**\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state `|ψ_norm⟩` and the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n\n`P(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|^2`\n`⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)] * [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)^T]`\n`= (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\n`P(P=0) = |-1/√3|^2 = 1/3`.\n\nAfter this measurement, the state of the system collapses to the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n\n**Step 4b: Probability of measuring Q = -1 from the new state**\nNow, the system is in the state `|p_0⟩`. The probability of measuring the value -1 for the observable Q is:\n\n`P(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩|^2`\n`⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)^T]`\n`= (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2`\n\n`P(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2`.\n\n**Step 4c: Total Probability**\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated above:\n\n`Total Probability = P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
