    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity to particle decay.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after traveling a certain distance is determined by their lifetime and the effects of time dilation.\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay Law**: The number of particles N remaining from an initial sample N₀ after a time `t'` in the particle's own rest frame is given by:\n    N = N₀ * e^(-t'/τ)\n    where `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's lifetime appears longer due to its high velocity. This is known as time dilation. The time `t` that passes in the lab frame is related to the proper time `t'` experienced by the particle through the Lorentz factor `γ` (gamma):\n    t' = t / γ\n\n3.  **Lab Frame Time**: The particles travel a distance `L` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    t = L / v ≈ L / c\n\n### Deriving the Solution\n\nBy combining these concepts, we can find the fraction of surviving particles. The proper time `t'` experienced by the particles as they travel to the detector wall is:\nt' ≈ (L / c) / γ\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives the survival probability `P`:\nP = N/N₀ = e^(-L / (cτγ))\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (cτ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation simplifies to:\nP = e^(-k / γ)\n\nWe can now use the two scenarios given in the problem to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Survival probability (P₁): 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): 20\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-k / 20)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Survival probability (P₂): 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂): ?\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n2/3 = e^(-k / γ₂)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂\nln(1.5) = k / γ₂\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂ by substituting the expression for `k` we found in Scenario 1:\nln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis result is very close to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
