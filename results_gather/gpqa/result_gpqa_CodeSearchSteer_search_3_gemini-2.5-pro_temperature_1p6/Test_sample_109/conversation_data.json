    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star: its visibility from both observatories and whether its apparent V magnitude is bright enough for both instruments.\n\n### 1. Observability Conditions\n\n*   **Location (Declination, DEC):** A star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in Chile and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Disregarding specific pointing limits as requested, a star is observable if it rises above the horizon.\n    *   Keck is at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can observe stars with a declination greater than -70°.\n    *   Paranal is at a latitude of about -24° S. It can observe stars with a declination less than +66°.\n    *   Therefore, a star must have a declination between **-70° and +66°** to be seen from both sites.\n\n*   **Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude, m_V):** The star's brightness must be within the limits of both spectrographs.\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (m_V < 17).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (m_V < 16).\n    *   The combined requirement is that a star must be brighter than 16th magnitude, i.e., **m_V < 16**.\n\n### 2. Star-by-Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d)`. If there is interstellar dust, an absorption term (A_V) must be added. A_V is calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the -70° to +66° range, making it not visible from Keck Observatory. Thus, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star2:** DEC = +55°. This is within the observable range for both sites. However, its apparent magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES. Thus, it is too faint for HIRES.\n\n*   **Star3:** DEC = +48°. This is within the observable declination range for both observatories. The information provided is \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\". This phrasing is ambiguous. However, if we take the apparent magnitude to be the stated 15.5, it satisfies the brightness condition for both instruments (15.5 < 17 and 15.5 < 16). The additional information on color excess is considered superfluous in this interpretation.\n\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both observatories. We must calculate its apparent magnitude.\n    *   Absorption A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Apparent magnitude m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n\n*   **Star5:** DEC = +60°. This is within the declination range for both sites. We must calculate its apparent magnitude.\n    *   Apparent magnitude m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 16.5 - 5 + 5 * (0.699) = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES and the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO. Thus, this star is detectable by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, Star 5 is clearly observable by both instruments, and Star 3 is also observable under the most reasonable interpretation of the ambiguous data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
