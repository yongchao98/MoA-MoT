  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%).\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show a complete loss of resistance (0%).\n    *   When the effect of a mutation in one gene (in this case, `g2`) masks the effect of mutations in other genes (`g1` and `g3`), this is known as epistasis. Specifically, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, this pattern strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3, and is essential for their function. Given the information that at least one gene is a transcription factor, it is the most logical conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor required to activate G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the roles of G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` both lead to a partial loss of resistance (75% and 50% remaining, respectively). This means both genes are involved in the resistance mechanism, but neither is individually essential.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` shows a resistance level of only 10%. This phenotype is much more severe than the phenotype of either single mutant and is also more severe than what would be expected from a simple additive effect (a 25% loss from `g1` and a 50% loss from `g3` would leave 25% resistance, not 10%).\n    *   This synergistic interaction, where the double mutant has a much stronger phenotype than the individual mutants, is characteristic of gene redundancy. This suggests that G1 and G3 have partially overlapping functions, likely in parallel pathways, both contributing to the final resistance outcome.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is strongly supported by the data showing G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is supported by the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is incorrect based on a classical definition, as the `g1g3` double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes. However, the first two conclusions are very strong.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"Pleiotropy\" means a single gene affects multiple unrelated traits. The experiment only measures one trait (anthracnose resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This is a possible molecular mechanism for their co-regulation by G2, but it cannot be concluded from this phenotypic experiment alone.\n\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": This is incorrect. The data shows G2 is epistatic to G1, suggesting G2 is upstream, not G1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite the imprecise use of the term \"epistatic\" for the G1-G3 interaction. The conclusions that G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy are strongly supported by the experimental results. The other options contain conclusions that are either contradicted by the data (D) or cannot be drawn from it (B, C). Therefore, A is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
