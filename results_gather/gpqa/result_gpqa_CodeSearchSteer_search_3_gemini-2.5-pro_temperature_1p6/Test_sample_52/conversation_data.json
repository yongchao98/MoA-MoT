    "The problem asks to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. A step-by-step analysis of the provided information leads to the correct formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Structural Information:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C₆H₄.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (-COO-) is confirmed. This group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR spectrum shows no –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information, as it rules out alkyl groups like ethyl or propyl, which contain methylene (–CH₂) units.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n*   **Six signals total:** This implies six chemically distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n*   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely *ortho* or *para*.\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a simple doublet. This propenyl group contributes C₃H₅ to the formula.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl signal originates from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH₃**). The second methyl signal must come from the other substituent. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl group is most logically part of a methyl ester (–COOCH₃).\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two substituents on the benzene ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CHCH₃) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH₃).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of atoms to determine the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 from the benzene ring + 3 from the propenyl group + 1 from the carbonyl (C=O) of the ester + 1 from the methyl part of the ester = **11 Carbon atoms**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 from the aromatic ring + 5 from the propenyl group (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H) + 3 from the methyl ester group = **12 Hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 from the ester group (–COO–).\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis conclusion is further supported by calculating the degree of unsaturation for C₁₁H₁₂O₂:\nDegree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nThis corresponds to a benzene ring (4 units), one C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 unit), and one C=O double bond in the ester group (1 unit), which perfectly matches the proposed structure.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
