  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein.

    "The inability to express the recombinant GADD45G protein stems from a critical error within the engineered gene sequence that prematurely halts protein synthesis. A detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the direct cause.\n\nThe provided sequence is:\n`5'-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGA...-3'`\n\nTo understand what is happening, this DNA sequence must be translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence, a process done by reading the sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons.\n\n*   **1. Start Codon:** Translation begins at the first `ATG` codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (M).\n*   **2. HA-Tag Sequence:** The next nine codons, `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, translate to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the correct sequence for the intended influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag.\n*   **3. Premature Stop Codon:** The very next codon in the sequence is `TGA`.\n\nIn the universal genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it does not add an amino acid; instead, translation is terminated, and the ribosome releases the unfinished polypeptide chain.\n\nThis means that instead of producing the full-length GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag, the cell is only producing a tiny, 12-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys, as `AAA` before the `TGA` codes for Lysine). This short peptide is non-functional and would likely not be detected in the expression analysis, explaining the observed failure to overexpress the desired protein. The presence of this premature termination codon, or nonsense codon, is a common and critical error in genetic engineering that leads to the production of a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. The stop codon is TGA, not UAA, and the absence of a tRNA for a stop codon is the normal mechanism for termination, not an error.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The DNA sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide of the HA tag.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can be beneficial, its absence does not guarantee failure. A much more definitive error is present in the sequence.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The premature TGA stop codon directly after the tag sequence halts translation, preventing the synthesis of the full GADD45G protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
