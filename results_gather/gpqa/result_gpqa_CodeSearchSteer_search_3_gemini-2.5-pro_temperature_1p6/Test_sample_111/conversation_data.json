    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State `|alpha>`\n\nThe given state of the electron is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. In quantum mechanics, a physical state must be represented by a normalized vector. A state vector `|ψ>` is normalized if its inner product with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, is equal to 1.\n\nLet the state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`, where C is the normalization constant.\n\nThe inner product `<alpha|alpha>` is calculated as follows:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [((1-i)(1+i)) + ((2+i)(2-i))] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2)] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 7|C|^2 = 1`\n\nThis gives `|C|^2 = 1/7`, so `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up>` is `[1, 0]` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Determine the Operator Matrix A\n\nThe problem describes the operator `A` with matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2-level system (`up` and `down`), this results in a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nThis can be written as `A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`, which is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = hbar^2 / 4`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n\nFor `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis yields the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`, which corresponds to `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis yields `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`, corresponding to `(1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in a particular eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the system's state vector onto that eigenstate.\n\n**Probability for eigenstate `|a₁>` (with eigenvalue +hbar/2):**\n`P(a₁) = |<a₁|alpha>|^2`\n`<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] · (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n`<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 * (1+i) + 1 * (2-i))`\n`<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n\n`P(a₁) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n**Probability for eigenstate `|a₂>` (with eigenvalue -hbar/2):**\n`P(a₂) = |<a₂|alpha>|^2`\n`<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] · (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n`<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 * (1+i) - 1 * (2-i))`\n`<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n\n`P(a₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average or expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|alpha>` is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. It can also be calculated by summing the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities: `<A> = Σ λᵢ * P(λᵢ)`.\n\nUsing the second method:\n`<A> = λ₁ * P(a₁) + λ₂ * P(a₂)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14) + (-hbar/2) * (5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar / 7`\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. Comparing these results with the given options, we find that option B matches.\n\n<<<B>>>"
