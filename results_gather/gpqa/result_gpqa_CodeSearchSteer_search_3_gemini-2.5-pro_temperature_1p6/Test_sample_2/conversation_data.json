    "To determine the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in a matrix representation. The principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the use of Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 particles, provide the framework for this calculation.\n\nThe given quantum state is a linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn the standard basis where `|↑⟩` (spin-up) is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` (spin-down) is represented by `[0, 1]`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nThe corresponding \"bra\" vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are defined as:\n*   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator in question is `A = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. Substituting the matrices:\n`A = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`A = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n`A = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\nThe expectation value `⟨A⟩` is calculated using the formula `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`. A straightforward way to compute this is to use the linearity of expectation values:\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of `σ_z`, `⟨σ_z⟩`:\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]^T`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of `σ_x`, `⟨σ_x⟩`:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for `⟨A⟩`:\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
