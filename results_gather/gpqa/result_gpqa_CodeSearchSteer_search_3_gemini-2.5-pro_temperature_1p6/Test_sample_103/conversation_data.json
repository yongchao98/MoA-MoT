    "The problem provides information about two exoplanetary systems detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. To find the ratio of the orbital periods, we need to relate the given observational data—the periodic wavelength shifts—to the orbital periods of the planets.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The RV method works by detecting the \"wobble\" of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble induces a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight, known as the radial velocity. This changing velocity causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r).\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: For a star with a planet in a circular orbit, its radial velocity varies sinusoidally over time. The amplitude of this variation is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by K. The observed periodic shifts in the spectral lines are directly proportional to this amplitude. Therefore, the ratio of the measured wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n    Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = K₂ / K₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\n3.  **Relating K to Orbital Period (P)**: The radial velocity amplitude (K) is determined by the masses of the star (M*) and the planet (Mp), as well as the orbital period (P). For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    K ∝ (Mp / M*^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3))\n\n    The full formula also includes the gravitational constant (G) and the sine of the orbital inclination (sin i), but these factors cancel out when taking a ratio, assuming the orbital inclinations are similar.\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe are given the following information for the two systems:\n*   The stellar masses are identical (M₁ = M₂).\n*   The planetary masses are similar (Mp₁ ≈ Mp₂).\n*   The orbits are circular.\n\nLet's write the expression for the radial velocity amplitude for each planet:\n*   K₁ ∝ (Mp₁ / M₁^(2/3)) * (1 / P₁^(1/3))\n*   K₂ ∝ (Mp₂ / M₂^(2/3)) * (1 / P₂^(1/3))\n\nNow, let's form the ratio K₂ / K₁:\nK₂ / K₁ = [(Mp₂ / M₂^(2/3)) * (1 / P₂^(1/3))] / [(Mp₁ / M₁^(2/3)) * (1 / P₁^(1/3))]\n\nSince the masses are the same for both systems (Mp₁ ≈ Mp₂ and M₁ = M₂), the mass terms cancel out:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3))\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe already established that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we have:\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo solve for the required ratio, P₂ / P₁, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we invert the expression to find P₂ / P₁:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
