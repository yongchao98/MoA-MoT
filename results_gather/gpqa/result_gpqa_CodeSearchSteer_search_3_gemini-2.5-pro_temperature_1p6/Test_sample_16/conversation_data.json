    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex is stable, but it undergoes a slight dissociation in solution. This process can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n    Ca-EDTA²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex:\n\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** To find the concentration of the dissociated ions at equilibrium, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and assume that it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Ca-EDTA²⁻**| 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| **Ca²⁺** | 0 | +x | x |\n| **EDTA⁴⁻**| 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Solve for 'x':** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n    Because K_f is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) to simply 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n5.  **Calculate 'x':** Now, rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the calcium ion concentration [Ca²⁺].\n\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
