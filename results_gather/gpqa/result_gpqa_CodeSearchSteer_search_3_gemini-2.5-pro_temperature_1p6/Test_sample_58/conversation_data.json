    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.050 mol\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 M = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it completely dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n    *   **Step 2a: Reaction between strong acid and strong base:**\n        H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n        We have 0.080 mol of H⁺ and 0.180 mol of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n        Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   **Step 2b: Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid:**\n        CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        We have 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.100 mol of OH⁻ remaining. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n        Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the final concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n    The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions, which is a strong base. The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess strong base.\n\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:**\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n    *   **Concentration of OH⁻:**\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution:**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        pH + pOH = 14\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
