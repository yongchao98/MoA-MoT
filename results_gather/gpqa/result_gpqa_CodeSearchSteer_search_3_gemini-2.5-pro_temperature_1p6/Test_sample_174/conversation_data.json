    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength. The behavior of such a system is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n**1. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power:**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle θ with respect to the oscillation axis (the z-axis in this problem). The relationship is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at the angle where sin²(θ) is at its maximum. This occurs at θ = 90° (perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where sin²(90°) = 1.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate the value of sin²(30°):\n\nsin(30°) = 1/2\nsin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power, A.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency (ω) of oscillation, and consequently on the wavelength (λ) of the emitted radiation. The total power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (P ∝ ω⁴).\n\nSince the angular frequency is inversely related to the wavelength (ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light), the power's dependence on wavelength is:\n\nP ∝ (1/λ)⁴ or P ∝ λ⁻⁴\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ relationship is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also the principle behind Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. The power per unit solid angle, f, will have this same wavelength dependence.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the function f includes a λ⁻⁴ term.\n\n<<<A>>>"
