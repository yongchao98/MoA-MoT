    "To solve this problem, we need to relate the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE).\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The mathematical relation is:\n    \n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    \n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    \n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality: Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ / 2.\n2.  **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). Since the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    \n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    \n    To find the relationship between the uncertainties (small changes) in energy and momentum, we can differentiate this equation. This leads to the relation:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    \n    where 'v' is the velocity of the particle. This relationship shows that the uncertainty in energy is proportional to the uncertainty in momentum, with the velocity as the constant of proportionality.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and solving for Δp:\n    Δp ≈ ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n2.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    \n    Δp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n3.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n    Using the relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp:\n    *   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    \n    ΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
