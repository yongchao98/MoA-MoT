    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole.\n\n### 1. Convert Units to SI\n\nFirst, we convert the given distance and angular size into SI units (meters and radians, respectively).\n\n*   **Distance (d):**\n    The distance to the galaxy is given as `d = 10^10 parsecs`.\n    One parsec is approximately `3.086 x 10^16` meters.\n    `d = 10^10 * (3.086 x 10^16) m = 3.086 x 10^26 m`\n\n*   **Angular Size (θ):**\n    The angular size of the event horizon is `θ = 10^-17 degrees`.\n    To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`.\n    `θ = 10^-17 * (π / 180) radians ≈ 1.745 x 10^-19 radians`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (R_s)\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. We can find it using the small-angle approximation, which states that for a small angle `θ` (in radians), `θ ≈ R_s / d`.\n\n*   `R_s = θ * d`\n*   `R_s ≈ (1.745 x 10^-19 radians) * (3.086 x 10^26 m)`\n*   `R_s ≈ 5.385 x 10^7 m`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon (A)\n\nAssuming the black hole is spherical, the area of its event horizon is given by the formula for the surface area of a sphere.\n\n*   `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`\n*   `A ≈ 4 * π * (5.385 x 10^7 m)^2`\n*   `A ≈ 3.644 x 10^16 m^2`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S)\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n\n*   `S = (k * A) / (4 * l_p^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K`)\n    *   `A` is the event horizon area we calculated.\n    *   `l_p` is the Planck length (`1.616 × 10^-35 m`)\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\n*   `l_p^2 ≈ (1.616 x 10^-35 m)^2 ≈ 2.611 x 10^-70 m^2`\n*   `S ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K * 3.644 x 10^16 m^2) / (4 * 2.611 x 10^-70 m^2)`\n*   `S ≈ (5.029 x 10^-7 J/K * m^2) / (10.444 x 10^-70 m^2)`\n*   `S ≈ 4.815 x 10^62 J/K`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated entropy of the black hole is approximately `4.815 x 10^62 J/K`. The order of magnitude is therefore `10^62 J/K`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) `10^59 J/K`\nB) `10^66 J/K`\nC) `10^65 J/K`\nD) `10^62 J/K`\n\nThe calculated order of magnitude matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
