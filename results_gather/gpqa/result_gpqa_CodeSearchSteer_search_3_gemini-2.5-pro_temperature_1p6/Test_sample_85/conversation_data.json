    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents involved.\n\n**The Product:**\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction A yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction B yields the (S)-enantiomer. This product is formed by the cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\n**The Starting Materials:**\nThe proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at the other. It also possesses a stereocenter at carbon 3.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A:**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is reduced at the ester position to form 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup promotes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and subsequent cyclization do not affect the stereocenter at the 3rd position of the starting material (which becomes the 4th position in the lactone). Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-enantiomer, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B:**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Borane (BH₃) followed by an acidic workup (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a classic reagent used for the chemoselective reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. Borane reacts much more rapidly with carboxylic acids than with esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is reduced at the carboxylic acid position to form isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reduction occurs at a functional group away from the stereocenter, so the configuration is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Because the product is the (S)-enantiomer, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining the conclusions for both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
