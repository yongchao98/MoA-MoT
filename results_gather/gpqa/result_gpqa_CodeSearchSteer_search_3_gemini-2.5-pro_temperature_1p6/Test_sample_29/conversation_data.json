    "When a textile dye absorbs light, its electrons are excited to a higher energy state. Subsequently, the molecule emits light, a process known as fluorescence, to return to its ground state. The emitted light is of a lower energy and longer wavelength than the absorbed light. The color we perceive is that of the emitted or reflected light, while the color of the light absorbed is its complementary color.\n\nTo determine the color of the absorbed light, we first need to calculate the wavelength of the emitted light and identify its color. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV.\n\nThe relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\nλ = hc / E\n\nWhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   E is the energy of the light\n\nA convenient formula for converting energy in electronvolts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\nλ ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the dye emits green light.\n\nThe color of light absorbed by the compound is the complementary color of the light it emits. The complementary color of green is red. Thus, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
