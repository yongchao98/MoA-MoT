    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and then determine the pH and hydrogen ion concentration of the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Molar Concentrations of Buffer Components\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each compound:\n*   **KH₂PO₄**: This salt provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), which acts as the weak acid in the buffer system.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Weight = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O**: This salt provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is the conjugate base.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Weight = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, we find the initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = **0.03674 M**\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = **0.02809 M**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe buffer system is based on the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves the equilibrium between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\nThe relevant equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\nNow, substitute the calculated concentrations:\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion (PO₄³⁻) Concentration\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation, which is governed by Ka₃.\n\nThe relevant equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nWe rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻], as its dissociation is minimal:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n\nThis calculated value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
