    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+)`\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is benzyl prenyl ether (`Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH=C(Me)2`). The reagents are butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, followed by an acidic workup (H+). This setup is characteristic of a Wittig rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation**: BuLi will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The two likely sites are the benzylic position (`Ph-CH2-O`) and the allylic position (`O-CH2-CH=`). The benzylic protons are more acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion by the phenyl ring. Thus, deprotonation occurs at the benzylic carbon to form an ylide intermediate: `[Ph-CH]- -O-CH2-CH=C(Me)2`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Possible Rearrangements**: From this intermediate, two main rearrangement pathways are possible: the-Wittig rearrangement and the-Wittig rearrangement.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted pericyclic reaction that is generally kinetically favored, especially at low temperatures. It would proceed through a 5-membered transition state to yield *3,3-dimethyl-1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol*. However, this product is not among the options provided.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a non-concerted process that proceeds through a radical-pair intermediate. It involves the migration of the prenyl group from the oxygen to the adjacent carbanionic carbon. The stability of the benzylic radical intermediate can make this pathway competitive. The product of the-rearrangement is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol** (`HO-CH(Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Me)2`).\n\n4.  **Select the Product for A**: Since the product of the generally favored-rearrangement is not an option, and the product of the-rearrangement, *4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol*, is listed in options A and C, it is the most plausible product for reaction A.\n\n### Reaction B: `3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat`\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type**: The prompt mentions the Cope rearrangement, and the reaction conditions (a 1,5-diene system heated) strongly indicate a-sigmatropic rearrangement. The reactant has two exocyclic double bonds (`1,11-dimethylene`), which form a 1,5-diene system ripe for this type of reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stoichiometry**: The Cope rearrangement is an intramolecular isomerization. This means that the product must have the exact same molecular formula and degree of unsaturation (number of rings and double bonds) as the reactant. No atoms are gained or lost.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Product Options based on Saturation**: The starting material's name includes `hexahydro`, indicating a certain level of saturation (six hydrogens more than the fully aromatic parent system).\n    *   The product for B listed in options A and B is a *tetrahydro* derivative. This would mean a loss of two hydrogen atoms (H2), which is inconsistent with a simple thermal Cope rearrangement.\n    *   The product for B listed in options C and D is a *hexahydro* derivative. This maintains the same degree of saturation as the reactant, which is consistent with the mechanism of a Cope rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction B**: Based on the conservation of the molecular formula, the product of reaction B must be the `hexahydro` compound, eliminating options A and B.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   From the analysis of Reaction A, the product is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   From the analysis of Reaction B, the product is the **hexahydro** derivative.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct choice is the one that pairs *A = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol* with the hexahydro product for B. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
