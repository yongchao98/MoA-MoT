    "The expression on the note, `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`, provides clues to the structure of the Feynman diagram it describes. In quantum field theory, calculations for diagrams containing loops involve integrating over all possible values of the internal, undetermined momenta.\n\nA key insight comes from a standard technique called dimensional regularization, used to handle the divergences that arise in these loop integrals. When performing calculations for a Feynman diagram with a certain number of loops in four-dimensional spacetime, a factor of `1/(4π)²` (which is `1/(16π²)`) typically appears for each loop after integrating over the loop momenta.\n\nThe term `1/(4π)⁶` in the scribbled note is the crucial piece of information. If we assume each loop in the diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4π)²`, we can determine the number of loops, which we can call 'L'. The total factor would be `(1/(4π)²) ^ L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy comparing this general form to the specific term in the note, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for L gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained three loops. The powers of the coupling constants, `alpha^3` and `g^2`, indicate that the diagram has a total of five vertices, which is consistent with a three-loop diagram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
