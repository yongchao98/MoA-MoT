    "Based on the provided chemical clues, we can deduce the identities of element Y and the five fluorine compounds (A1-A5).\n\n### Identification of Element Y and the Compounds\n\n1.  **Element Y and Compound A2**: The substance A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ωF=31,96%). We can use this to determine the molar mass of element Y. If we assume the formula of A2 is YFₓ, the molar mass of Y can be calculated with the formula: M(Y) = M(F) * x * (1/ωF - 1). Using the molar mass of Fluorine (19.00 g/mol) and testing integer values for x, we find that for x=4, the molar mass of Y is approximately 101.1 g/mol. This corresponds to the element **Ruthenium (Ru)**.\n    *   Thus, Y is Ruthenium (Ru).\n    *   Compound A2 is Ruthenium tetrafluoride (RuF₄). Let's check the mass percentage: ωF(RuF₄) = (4 * 19.01) / (101.07 + 4 * 19.01) * 100% = 31.98%, which matches the given value.\n\n2.  **Five Binary Fluorides of Ruthenium**: Ruthenium is known to form several binary fluorides, including RuF₃, RuF₄, RuF₅, and RuF₆, as well as a dimeric compound (RuF₅)₂, fitting the description of five known compounds.\n\n3.  **Compound A1**: A1 is described as a \"bright-red\" substance that decomposes into A2 (RuF₄) and fluorine at 293 K. This indicates A1 has a higher oxidation state than RuF₄. Ruthenium pentafluoride, RuF₅, fits this description. While often described as green or dark brown, it can form adducts and complex species, and its decomposition to the pinkish RuF₄ could be consistent with the color change. The decomposition reaction would be: 2RuF₅ → 2RuF₄ + F₂. Furthermore, A1 is stated to oxidize xenon under normal conditions. RuF₅ is a powerful fluorinating and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon.\n    *   A1 is Ruthenium pentafluoride (RuF₅).\n\n4.  **Compound A3**: A3 also interacts with xenon and is obtained by the fluorination of Ruthenium. Ruthenium hexafluoride (RuF₆) is a stronger oxidizing agent than RuF₅ and is known to react with xenon. It is formed by direct fluorination of the metal at high temperatures.\n    *   A3 is Ruthenium hexafluoride (RuF₆).\n\n5.  **Compound A5 and A4**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Ruthenium metal) to a hot concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A known reaction involves the reduction of RuF₅ (A1) to produce lower fluorides. For example, RuF₅ can be reduced by various elements. It's plausible A4 is also a ruthenium fluoride. A known synthesis method involves reducing RuF₅ with iodine to produce RuF₃. The reaction mentioned hints at a comproportionation reaction. Given that we have identified RuF₄, RuF₅, and RuF₆, the remaining common fluorides are RuF₃ and potentially a complex. If A4 is RuF₅ and Y is Ru, the reaction 4RuF₅ + Ru → 5RuF₄ could occur. However, the problem states that by adding Y to A4, we obtain A5. Let's reconsider the compounds.\n\nBased on the reactions with Xenon and the high oxidation states, the most likely candidates for the higher fluorides are established:\n*   A1: RuF₅\n*   A2: RuF₄\n*   A3: RuF₆\n\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be lower oxidation state fluorides or related species. A common lower fluoride is RuF₃. Let's assign A5 as RuF₃. The problem states \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" Ruthenium(III) fluoride is noted as insoluble in water, but many metal fluorides do hydrolyze.\n\nLet's re-examine the A4 to A5 reaction: **Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio)**. This translates to **Ru + A4 → A5**. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction where Ruthenium metal (oxidation state 0) reacts with a higher-oxidation-state fluoride (A4) to form a fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n\nA known reaction is: **3RuF₅ + 2Ru → 5RuF₃**. While not a 1:1 ratio, it establishes the plausibility of such a reaction.\n\nLet's reconsider the identity of A4. It is described as being in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could refer to a solution in an anhydrous solvent like HF.\n\nConsidering the most common fluorides are RuF₃, RuF₄, and RuF₅, let's test the possibility that **A4 is Ruthenium(V) fluoride, RuF₅**.\n\n*   Molar Mass of RuF₅ = 101.07 + (5 * 19.00) = **196.07 g/mol**.\n\nThis value falls squarely in the range of **180-200 g/mol**. None of the options match this directly. Let's re-read the molecular weight options and re-check our work.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 140-160\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nLet's calculate the molar masses for all identified Ru fluorides:\n*   RuF₃: 101.07 + 3*19.00 = 158.07 g/mol\n*   RuF₄: 101.07 + 4*19.00 = 177.07 g/mol\n*   RuF₅: 101.07 + 5*19.00 = 196.07 g/mol\n*   RuF₆: 101.07 + 6*19.00 = 215.07 g/mol\n\nThe clue states that A5 is obtained by adding Ruthenium metal to A4. This implies A4 has a higher oxidation state than A5.\nLet's assume A4 is RuF₄. Its molecular weight is 177.07 g/mol. This value falls within the range D) 160-180.\nIf A4 = RuF₄, a possible reaction is: **RuF₄ + Ru → 2RuF₂** (hypothetical) or formation of other lower fluorides.\n\nLet's assume A4 is RuF₃. Its molecular weight is 158.07 g/mol. This falls within the range A) 140-160. This is less likely, as adding Ru metal to RuF₃ would require forming a fluoride with an oxidation state lower than +3, which is less common.\n\nThe most chemically sound interpretation identifies the compounds as various known fluorides of Ruthenium. Let's reconsider the set:\n*   Y = Ru\n*   A1 = RuF₅\n*   A2 = RuF₄ (MW = 177.07 g/mol)\n*   A3 = RuF₆ (MW = 215.07 g/mol)\n*   A4 = ?\n*   A5 = RuF₃ (MW = 158.07 g/mol)\n\nLet's fit A4 into the reaction: **Ru + A4 -> RuF₃**.\nA comproportionation reaction to form RuF₃ would need A4 to have an oxidation state greater than +3. The candidates are RuF₄, RuF₅, or RuF₆.\n\nIf A4 is RuF₄, the molecular weight is ~177 g/mol. This fits range D.\nIf A4 is RuF₅, the molecular weight is ~196 g/mol. This does not fit any range.\nIf A4 is RuF₆, the molecular weight is ~215 g/mol. This does not fit any range.\n\nBased on the provided options, the most plausible candidate for A4 is **RuF₄**, with a molecular weight of 177.07 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of the clues:\n*   Five binary compounds: RuF₃, RuF₄, RuF₅, RuF₆, (RuF₅)₂ - Plausible.\n*   A1 (bright-red) -> A2 (ωF=31,96%) + F₂. Let's say A1=RuF₅ and A2=RuF₄. The colors are variable, but the chemistry is sound. A2 is RuF₄ (ωF=31.98%).\n*   A1 and A3 oxidize xenon: RuF₅ and RuF₆ are strong oxidizers capable of this.\n*   A3 from fluorination of Y: RuF₆ is made by direct fluorination of Ru.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio): This remains the most ambiguous step. However, if we must choose from the list, assigning the known fluorides to the clues leads to A4 most likely being RuF₄ based on its molecular weight fitting one of the options.\n\nThe molecular weight of RuF₄ is 177.07 g/mol, which is in the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
