    "The search results confirm the underlying physics used in the calculation.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's properties (temperature and radius), the planet's albedo, and its distance from the star (semi-major axis). For a planet orbiting a given star, the equilibrium temperature T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance 'a'. This confirms the relationship `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`, which was the first step in the derivation.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results clearly state Kepler's Third Law: The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). When comparing two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of the squares of their periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semi-major axes: `(P1/P2)² = (a1/a2)³`. This confirms the second part of the calculation.\n\n3.  **Planet Mass:** The more precise form of Kepler's Third Law includes the mass of the star and the planet. However, it is noted that the planet's mass is often negligible compared to the star's mass and is not considered in the basic relationship. Since the problem does not provide the star's mass, it is standard practice to use the simplified, proportional relationship, meaning the provided mass ratios are indeed extraneous information.\n\nThe calculation steps remain solid:\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature Ratio to Orbital Distance Ratio:**\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    *   Given T₁ / T₂ ≈ 1.4, then a₂ / a₁ ≈ 1.4² = 1.96.\n    *   T₂ / T₃ = √(a₃ / a₂)\n    *   Given T₂ / T₃ ≈ 2.3, then a₃ / a₂ ≈ 2.3² = 5.29.\n\n2.  **Find the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio (a₃ / a₁):**\n    *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Period Ratio (P₃ / P₁):**\n    *   (P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁)³\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.386.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\nThe final conclusion is consistent and based on standard astronomical formulas confirmed by the search.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to present to the user.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (a), which is the semi-major axis for a circular orbit.\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is:\nT_i / T_j = √(a_j / a_i)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\nT_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\nT_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T₁ / T₂)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n*   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (T₂ / T₃)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply these ratios:\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (a) from the star (P² ∝ a³). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n(P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁)³\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we substitute the value of a₃ / a₁ calculated in Step 2:\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.386\n\nThe factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and albedo is not needed for this calculation, as the albedo is uniform and the planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of all steps and information. The question is straightforward if one knows the correct formulas. The extra data (masses, albedo value, TTV method) is there to potentially confuse, but it's not needed for the solution under standard assumptions. The calculation is correct. The result is B.\n\nFinal answer should be presented clearly based on these steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$. To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is related to its orbital distance (a) by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the orbital distance.\n*   A is the albedo.\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and A are constant for all three planets. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between any two planets (i and j) in the system is:\n\nT_i / T_j = √(a_j / a_i)\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   For Planet 1 and Planet 2: a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n*   For Planet 2 and Planet 3: a₃/a₂ = (T₂/T₃)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a₃/a₁), we multiply the individual ratios:\n\na₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\n\n(P₃/P₁)² = (a₃/a₁)³\n\nP₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₃/a₁ we found in Step 2:\n\nP₃/P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The additional information provided in the problem, such as the mass ratios and the specific albedo value, is not necessary for this calculation because planetary masses are generally negligible compared to the stellar mass, and the albedo cancels out as it is the same for all planets.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of about 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
