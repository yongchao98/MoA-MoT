    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n#### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has one chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the attack of the hydride on the prochiral ketone is not random. The existing (S) stereocenter at C5 directs the approach of the hydride ion, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are formed in unequal amounts.\n\n#### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric, achiral molecule with two ketone groups.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of both ketones produces pentane-2,4-diol, which has two chiral centers (at C2 and C4). Three stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined and analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers. The meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other and will be separated. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. Therefore, Reaction II will show **two peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and are expected to have different retention times. Thus, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction: 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomeric products will be separated, just as in normal-phase HPLC, giving **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the three stereoisomers. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II, the total number of peaks will be the sum from both reactions: 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
