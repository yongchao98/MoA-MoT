    "The fundamental principle at play here is electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts electrons from the conductor. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n3.  **Distribution of Outer Charge:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the absence of any other external electric fields, this `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface. The internal configuration of the cavity and the exact position of the charge `+q` within it are shielded from the outside.\n4.  **Electric Field Outside:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The electric field at the external point P is created by the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the field at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor is given by the formula for a point charge. The distance `l` from the cavity's center, the distance `s` between the centers, and the angle `\\(\\theta\\)` are all irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
