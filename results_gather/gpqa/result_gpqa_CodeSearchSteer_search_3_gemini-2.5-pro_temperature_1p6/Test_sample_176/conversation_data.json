    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the star's radius.\n    *   `T` is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 (L₁) to that of Star 2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) ² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the temperature of a black body to the peak wavelength (λ_em) of its emitted spectrum in its own rest frame:\n    λ_em = b / T  (where 'b' is Wien's constant)\n    This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_em. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_em₂ / λ_em₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect formula for light. The radial velocity causes a shift in the wavelength.\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_em₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. This velocity causes a Doppler shift. Assuming it is a recessional velocity (moving away), the wavelength is redshifted. Using the non-relativistic approximation (since v ≪ c):\n        λ_obs₂ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n        where c is the speed of light (≈ 300,000 km/s).\n\n6.  **Connecting the Ratios:** Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have:\n    λ_em₁ = λ_em₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature ratio calculation:\n    λ_em₂ / λ_em₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Now, plug in the values for v₂ and c:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333...)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
