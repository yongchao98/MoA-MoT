    "To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The total energy is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges in the system.\n\nThe system consists of:\n*   One particle with charge `q_c = 2e` fixed at a point P.\n*   Twelve identical particles, each with charge `q_s = 2e`, constrained to a distance `r = 2 m` from point P. This means they lie on the surface of a sphere of radius `r` centered at P.\n\nThe total potential energy (`E_total`) can be divided into two parts:\n1.  **`E_center-sphere`**: The interaction energy between the central charge `q_c` and the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n2.  **`E_sphere-sphere`**: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n### 1. Energy of Interaction between the Center and the Sphere (`E_center-sphere`)\nThe distance between the central charge and each of the 12 surface charges is fixed at `r = 2 m`. The potential energy for each pair is given by Coulomb's law:\n`E_pair = k * (q_c * q_s) / r`\nSince there are 12 such identical interactions, this part of the energy is:\n`E_center-sphere = 12 * k * (2e * 2e) / r = 12 * k * 4e^2 / r`\n\n### 2. Energy of Interaction among the Charges on the Sphere (`E_sphere-sphere`)\nFor the total energy of the system to be at a minimum, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum over all unique pairs of the 12 charges:\n`E_sphere-sphere = Σ_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12} k * (q_s * q_s) / r_ij = k * (2e)^2 * Σ_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12} (1 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n\nThis sum `Σ (1 / r_ij)` for an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r` can be written as `(1/r) * E*_{12}`, where `E*_{12}` is the dimensionless energy coefficient for N=12. The value for `E*_{12}` is approximately 49.165314.\n\n### Calculation of Total Energy\nCombining the two components:\n`E_total = E_center-sphere + E_sphere-sphere`\n`E_total = (12 * k * 4e^2 / r) + (k * 4e^2 * E*_{12} / r)`\n`E_total = (k * 4e^2 / r) * (12 + E*_{12})`\n`E_total = (k * 4e^2 / r) * (12 + 49.165314)`\n`E_total = (k * 4e^2 / r) * (61.165314)`\n\nNow, we plug in the physical constants:\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`.\n*   Elementary charge, `e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e ≈ 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   Radius of the sphere, `r = 2 m`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `k * 4e^2 / r`:\n`k * 4e^2 / r = (8.98755 × 10^9 * (2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19)^2) / 2`\n`k * 4e^2 / r ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.026788 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`k * 4e^2 / r ≈ 9.22851 × 10^-28 / 2 ≈ 4.614255 × 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, multiply by the factor `(61.165314)`:\n`E_total ≈ (4.614255 × 10^-28) * 61.165314`\n`E_total ≈ 2.82236 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding the result to three decimal places gives `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
