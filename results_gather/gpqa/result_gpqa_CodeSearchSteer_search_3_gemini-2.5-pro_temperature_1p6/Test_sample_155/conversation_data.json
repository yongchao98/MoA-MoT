    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-(E)-alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a stereospecific syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack can happen from either the top or bottom face with equal probability. This results in the formation of a *trans*-epoxide as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers).\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a ring-opening reaction that proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition. The incoming nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen bridge, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon it attacks.\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral *meso* compound. Thus, Reaction 1 yields a single product.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-(Z)-alkene with mCPBA is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This forms a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane) is a *meso* compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent *anti*-addition of water opens the *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon leads to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Reaction 2, therefore, produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **Isomer A:** *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   **Isomer B:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Isomer C:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n**Stereochemical Relationships:**\n*   Isomers B and C are enantiomers of each other.\n*   Isomer A is a diastereomer of both Isomer B and Isomer C.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column cannot differentiate between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair (Isomers B and C) will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated on an achiral column. The *meso* compound (Isomer A) is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different retention time, appearing as a separate peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment. In this environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, allowing them to be separated. Therefore, Isomer B and Isomer C will have different retention times and appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound (Isomer A), being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
