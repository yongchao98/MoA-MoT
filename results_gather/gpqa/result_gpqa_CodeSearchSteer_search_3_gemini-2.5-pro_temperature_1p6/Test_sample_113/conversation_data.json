    "Here is a breakdown of the reagents required for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n\n*   While sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the necessary cyanide ions, the reaction is significantly accelerated in the presence of an acid.\n*   An acid (represented as H₃O⁺) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and susceptible to attack by the cyanide nucleophile.\n*   Alternatively, the acid reacts with NaCN to generate hydrogen cyanide (HCN) *in situ*. The cyanide ion then attacks the carbonyl, and the resulting alkoxide intermediate is protonated by HCN.\n*   Therefore, reagent **A** must be an acid, such as **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction is generally slow and requires heating under reflux.\n*   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis involves protonating the nitrile, which makes it more reactive towards a water molecule. After a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide intermediate and then to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n*   A strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a standard and effective reagent for this hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would be much less effective for complete hydrolysis.\n*   Therefore, reagent **B** is a strong acid, **HCl**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
