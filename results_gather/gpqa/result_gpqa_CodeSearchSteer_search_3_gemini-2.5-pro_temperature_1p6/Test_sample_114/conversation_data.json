    "The provided search results confirm the fundamental principles used in the initial thought process. Specifically, they reiterate that all electron-positron annihilation processes must obey the laws of conservation of energy and linear momentum. The process described is an example of relativistic kinematics, where the total 4-momentum (a vector combining energy and 3D momentum) is conserved. When the initial net momentum is not zero, the resulting photons are not emitted back-to-back (i.e., not at 180 degrees).\n\nMy step-by-step derivation of the photon angle based on these conservation laws is a standard approach to this type of problem. The calculation yielded approximately 138.2 degrees, which strongly corresponds to option C. The search did not provide a direct calculator or an identical problem setup, but the underlying physics is thoroughly validated. The key is that the initial momentum of the system dictates the final momentum, forcing the photons into a configuration where their combined momentum matches the initial state. My calculation correctly implements this.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n        *   Energy, E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c².\n        *   Momentum, p_e = √((E_e/c)² - (m_e*c)²) = √((4*m_e*c)² - (m_e*c)²) = √(15) * m_e * c.\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n        *   Energy, E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c².\n        *   Momentum, p_p = √((E_p/c)² - (m_e*c)²) = √((2*m_e*c)² - (m_e*c)²) = √(3) * m_e * c.\n\n2.  **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. This total energy is equally distributed between the two photons.\n        *   E_total = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c².\n        *   Energy per photon, E_ph = E_total / 2 = 3*m_e*c².\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The total initial momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, we subtract the magnitudes.\n        *   p_total = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c.\n        This total initial momentum must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons.\n\n3.  **Final State and Angle Calculation:**\n    *   The momentum of each photon is p_ph = E_ph / c = 3*m_e*c.\n    *   Since the photons' energies are equal and one moves to the upper-right and the other to the lower-right, their paths must be symmetric around the horizontal axis. Let θ be the angle of each photon with respect to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The total momentum of the photons in the direction of the initial collision is the sum of their horizontal momentum components: p_final = p_ph*cos(θ) + p_ph*cos(θ) = 2*p_ph*cos(θ).\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: (√15 - √3)*m_e*c = 2 * (3*m_e*c) * cos(θ).\n    *   Solving for cos(θ): cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6.\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568.\n        *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°.\n    *   The angle *between* the two photons is 2θ.\n        *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
