    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two aromatic compounds present in the mixture.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the options:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, it has two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two equivalent protons at positions 3 and 6, which will produce a single singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in one singlet for all 12 methyl protons.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, leading to one aromatic singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the ones at positions 1 and 4, and the ones at positions 2 and 3. This results in two aliphatic singlets, each integrating to 6 protons (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and two aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments and will produce two separate singlets.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three non-equivalent sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair, the C2, and the C5. This would lead to three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two aromatic singlets (1H each) and three aliphatic singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in one singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups would show coupling, resulting in a quartet for the two CH2 groups and a triplet for the two CH3 groups.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet, one aliphatic quartet, and one aliphatic triplet. This does not match the observation of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nThe problem states the mixture contains two compounds and shows a total of two aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB also provides one singlet (2H). A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **two singlets** of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1). This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. A mixture would show three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Mixture C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. A mixture would show three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet, not singlets as observed. This option is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe only combination of compounds that matches the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
