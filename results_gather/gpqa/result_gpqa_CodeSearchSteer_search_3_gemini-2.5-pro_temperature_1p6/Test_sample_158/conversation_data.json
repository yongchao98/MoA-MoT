    "The observation of a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths in a quasar's spectrum is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha emission line. This prominent feature is a key indicator of the quasar's redshift, as the absorption at shorter wavelengths is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest—a series of absorption lines from intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm). The redshift (z) of the quasar can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nGiven the observed wavelength (λ_observed) of 790 nm and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) of 121.6 nm, the redshift is:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.5\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance can be calculated using the parameters of the specified Lambda-CDM cosmological model: a Hubble constant (H₀) of 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, a matter density parameter (Ω_m) of 0.3, a dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) of 0.7, and a flat universe (implying the curvature parameter Ω_k is 0).\n\nThe comoving distance is calculated by integrating the Hubble parameter over redshift. For a flat universe, the formula for comoving distance (D_C) is:\n\nD_C = (c / H₀) ∫[0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nwhere 'c' is the speed of light.\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with the values z = 5.5, H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ω_m = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8964 Mpc, which is about 8.96 Gpc.\n\nComparing this calculated distance with the given options:\nA) 8 Gpc\nB) 9 Gpc\nC) 6 Gpc\nD) 7 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 9 Gpc aligns with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
