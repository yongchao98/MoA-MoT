    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Identify the Relevant Neutrino Sources\nThe question asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands, Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV), under the hypothetical condition that the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain has stopped.\n\nFirst, let's identify the neutrino-producing reactions and their energy ranges:\n*   **pp-I chain:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos with energies up to 420 keV. These do not contribute to the bands in question.\n*   **pp-II chain:** Produces monoenergetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). The primary line has an energy of 861 keV, with a much smaller contribution from a 384 keV line. The 861 keV line falls squarely within **Band 2**.\n*   **pp-III chain:** Produces high-energy `⁸B` (Boron-8) neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos would normally contribute a small flux to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n*   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O, with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. This cycle contributes a continuous flux to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\nThe prompt states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This has two main consequences:\n1.  The flux of `⁸B` neutrinos becomes zero.\n2.  All other reactions, including the pp-II chain and the CNO cycle, continue.\n\nAn important detail noted in the prompt is that the stoppage of the pp-III branch is a \"red herring.\" The contribution of `⁸B` neutrinos in the 700-900 keV range is insignificant compared to the other sources, so its removal does not meaningfully change the flux ratio in this specific energy region.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the existing flux ratio in this energy range, ignoring the `⁸B` contribution.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Flux in Each Band\nWith the pp-III branch turned off, the remaining sources of neutrino flux in the specified bands are:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only contribution comes from the continuous spectrum of **CNO neutrinos**.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The flux here is composed of two parts: the very strong, monoenergetic **⁷Be neutrino line** at 861 keV and the continuous background from **CNO neutrinos**.\n\nThe total flux of the ⁷Be line is immensely greater than the integrated flux of CNO neutrinos over a 100 keV band. Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Estimate the Flux Ratio\nWe need to calculate the ratio: Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n*   Flux(Band 1) ≈ Flux from CNO cycle in a 100 keV band.\n*   Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux from the ⁸⁶¹ keV ⁷Be line.\n\nTo find the ratio without using precise differential flux charts, we can use order-of-magnitude estimates based on the total fluxes from each process:\n*   The total flux from the **⁷Be line** is approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n*   The total flux from the entire **CNO cycle** is approximately 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the total CNO flux is about 1/10th of the total ⁷Be flux.\n\nNext, we need to estimate what fraction of the total CNO flux falls within the 100 keV window of Band 1. The CNO spectrum extends up to 1.73 MeV. A 100 keV slice near the middle of its range represents a fraction of its total flux. A reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate for this fraction is also about 1/10.\n\nCombining these estimations:\n*   Flux(Band 1) ≈ (Fraction of CNO flux in the band) × (Total CNO flux)\n*   Flux(Band 1) ≈ (0.1) × (0.1 × Total ⁷Be Flux)\n*   Flux(Band 1) ≈ 0.01 × Total ⁷Be Flux\n\nNow, we can calculate the final ratio:\nRatio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (0.01 × Total ⁷Be Flux) / (Total ⁷Be Flux)\n\n**Ratio ≈ 0.01**\n\nThis corresponds to the option (10⁻²).\n\n<<<C>>>"
