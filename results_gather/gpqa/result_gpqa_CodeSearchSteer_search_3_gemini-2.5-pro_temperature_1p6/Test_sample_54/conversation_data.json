    "To identify the unknown organic compound, the provided 1H NMR data will be systematically analyzed and compared to the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal indicates three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (a singlet). This chemical shift and multiplicity are characteristic of the methyl group protons in an acetate (CH₃COO-) moiety. All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d). This means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This corresponds to a CH₃-CH= group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is from a single proton (1H) in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons have smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-15 Hz. The large J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* stereochemistry about the double bond. This eliminates the *cis* isomers, options (A) and (D).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to another single vinylic proton (1H). The multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n### Structure Elucidation:\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound has the following structural features:\n1.  An acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n2.  A *trans*-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=).\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. This is known as propenyl acetate. The (E) isomer corresponds to the *trans* configuration. The IUPAC name is (1E)-prop-1-en-1-yl acetate.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect stereochemistry (*cis*) and contains a butenyl group (4 carbons) instead of a propenyl group (3 carbons).\n*   **B) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correctly identifies the *trans* stereochemistry and the propenyl group. The structure perfectly matches the fragments deduced from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) Trans-butenyl acetate:** While it has the correct stereochemistry (*trans*), it has a butenyl group, which is inconsistent with the fragmentation pattern (specifically the dq and d signals for the vinyl and methyl protons).\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect stereochemistry (*cis*), which contradicts the large coupling constant.\n\nThe data is fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
