    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement characteristic of 1,5-dienes, which are molecules with two carbon-carbon double bonds separated by three single bonds. Heating is a typical condition to initiate this concerted pericyclic reaction.\n\nTo determine the product, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the starting molecule:** The starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is:\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Locate the 1,5-diene system:** The core of the molecule that participates in the rearrangement is the `C₂=C₃-C₄-C₅-C₆=C₇` chain. This constitutes a substituted hexa-1,5-diene system.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement:** This rearrangement involves the breaking of the sigma (single) bond between C-4 and C-5 and the formation of a new sigma bond between C-2 and C-7. Simultaneously, the pi (double) bonds shift from C-2/C-3 and C-6/C-7 to C-3/C-4 and C-5/C-6.\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The rearrangement results in a new carbon skeleton. By tracing the connections in the new molecule, we find the longest carbon chain that includes both new double bonds. The resulting structure is:\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n5.  **Name the product:** Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the longest chain containing the two double bonds has ten carbon atoms, making it a decadiene. Numbering from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest locants (from the left in the structure drawn above), the double bonds are at positions 1 and 5. The substituents are a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (This is identical to B)\nD) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\nThe calculated product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
