    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first deduce the structure of the product.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent. This reagent is known to reduce a wide variety of oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as carbon-carbon double and triple bonds, completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, it will reduce:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Alcohols (-OH) to alkanes (-H).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product:**\nThe starting molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has several functional groups and sites of unsaturation that will be reduced:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (an aldehyde, -CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n\nThis means the original cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring. The substituents will be two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds within a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\nwhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by simply counting the number of rings and pi bonds in the structure.\n\n*   The product is a substituted **cyclohexane**.\n*   This structure contains **one ring**.\n*   Since all the double bonds were reduced, it contains **zero pi bonds**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe presence of the single ring in the saturated cyclohexane structure gives it an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
