    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by the formula: `Mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12, this becomes `m / (12n + m)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28% (or 0.1428): `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`. This value is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which simplifies to `7m ≈ 12n + m`, or `6m ≈ 12n`, giving the ratio `m/n = 2`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and its general molecular formula is (CH₂)ₙ or CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane used as an industrial solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ with n=6.\n\nTherefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know one of them is Z, so let Y₁ = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, both components must convert to cyclohexane. The hydrogenation of Y₁ (cyclohexane) yields cyclohexane (no reaction). The hydrogenation of Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it must be a saturated or aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), the \"only one substance\" rule might be violated depending on reaction conditions. However, a very common and stable C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is a liquid at room temperature. Its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane: C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂.\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**. This mixture fits all the given descriptions.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and a crucial reaction\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂, that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n*   The overall reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂ (in equimolar amounts).\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y: **X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆**\n*   Since hydrogenation of both X₁ and X₂ gives only cyclohexane, both X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ hydrocarbons that have a six-carbon skeleton (e.g., they are cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene isomers).\n*   The condition that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X guides the choice of specific isomers. For instance, if one component were a cyclohexadiene, it would have to be 1,4-cyclohexadiene, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the conservation of atoms in the chemical reaction. We can determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by summing the hydrogen atoms in the products (mixture Y).\n\n*   Reactants: One molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂.\n*   Products: One molecule of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and one molecule of benzene (C₆H₆).\n\nBy the principle of atom conservation, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction:\n\nTotal H in (X₁ + X₂) = Total H in (C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆)\nTotal H = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene)\n**Total H = 18**\n\nThe two liquids in the equimolar mixture X are most likely cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). In a disproportionation reaction, the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, confirming our result.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
