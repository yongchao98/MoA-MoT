    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas Treatment Results**:\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: A calcium hydroxide solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: The formation of CuO indicates that the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas from the mixture. The mass increase of 0.80 g is from the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. This means 0.80 g of oxygen atoms were present in the gas entering the tube.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C)**: At standard temperature and pressure, 2.24 liters of the final gas were collected.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify the Gaseous Products**: The decomposition of the salts at 200°C produced only gases.\n    *   The salts must contain hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen to produce the observed products. Ammonium salts of oxoanions are likely candidates.\n    *   Let's assume the oxidizing gas that reacted with copper was nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂.\n    *   The 0.80 g mass increase in tube №3 corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. Based on the reaction stoichiometry, this means **0.05 mol of N₂O** was decomposed, producing **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n    *   The total remaining gas C is 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ was produced in tube №3, the other 0.05 mol must have been an inert gas from the initial decomposition that did not react. The most likely candidate is also N₂.\n    *   Therefore, the initial gas mixture from heating salts A and B was: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**: We need to find two salts in an equimolar mixture that decompose to yield these specific amounts of gases without leaving a solid residue.\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) at around 200°C yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the mixture contains **0.05 mol of Salt A (NH₄NO₃)** and **0.05 mol of Salt B (NH₄NO₂)**.\n        *   0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂O + (0.05 × 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.1 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.05 × 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.1 mol H₂O\n    *   **Total Products**: 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.1 + 0.1) mol H₂O = **0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.2 mol H₂O**. This perfectly matches our derived gas mixture.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass**:\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃)**: 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂)**: 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = 9 + 8 = **17 atoms**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
