    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Compound A (C₃H₆):** This is propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂).\n*   **Compound B:** Propene reacts with bromine (Br₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) via an addition reaction to form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br)).\n*   **Compound C:** 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a double dehydrohalogenation reaction to yield propyne (CH₃-C≡CH).\n*   **Compound D:** When propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene.\n*   **Compound E:** Mesitylene (D) reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) to form 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n*   **Compound F:** The nitro compound (E) is reduced with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) to form 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine).\n*   **Compound G:** 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) at low temperatures to form the corresponding diazonium salt, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride.\n*   **Compound H:** The diazonium salt (G) reacts with sodium hydroxide or is warmed with water, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a red, blue, green, or purple coloration due to the formation of a complex with the iron(III) ion. While some hindered phenols may not give a positive test, a yellow color is generally not the expected positive result and may simply be the color of the ferric chloride solution itself, indicating no reaction. Research shows that 2,4,6-trimethylphenol is oxidized by Fe(III) complexes, but a characteristic yellow color for the standard test is not a documented positive result. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect.\n\n**B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its symmetrical structure, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will appear as one singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. Similarly, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and will give another singlet. Thus, the spectrum correctly consists of two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**C) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne (CH₃-C≡CH). Propyne is a colorless, flammable gas at standard temperature and pressure, with a boiling point of -23.2 °C. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines, including substituted anilines like this one, are important intermediates in the chemical industry, particularly for the production of dyes. This statement is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
