    "To identify the unknown white solid, we must systematically analyze each piece of spectral data.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This suggests the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (assuming the chlorine is the 35Cl isotope).\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options (using 35Cl):\n        *   Phenyl chloroformate (C7H5ClO2): MW = 7(12) + 5(1) + 35.5 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This fits.\n        *   3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C7H5ClO2): MW = 156.5. This fits.\n        *   2-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2): MW = 156.5. This fits.\n        *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2): MW = 156.5. This fits.\n    *   The mass spectrometry data confirms the molecular formula is likely C7H5ClO2, which is consistent with all four possible answers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm-1 is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate option A (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and B (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H that is typically less broad and an aldehyde C=O). Both 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D) are consistent with the IR data.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent and the two protons on the other side equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining options:\n        *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,2-disubstituted (*ortho*) benzene ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would give a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n        *   D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,4-disubstituted (*para*) benzene ring. Its symmetry would produce exactly the pattern observed: two doublets, each for two protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at the lower field (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine appear at the higher field (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows the correct molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring is 1,4-(*para*).\n\n<<<D>>>"
