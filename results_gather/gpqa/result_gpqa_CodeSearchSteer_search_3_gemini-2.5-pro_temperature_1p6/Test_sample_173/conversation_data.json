    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Given Information\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, E = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n*   The ratio of the rest-masses is m₁ = 2m₂.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses of the fragments:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n(2m₂) + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nNext, we convert these masses into their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): E₁ = m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): E₂ = m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe total energy is conserved. The energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments.\n\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy T is given by p²/2m, where p is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   p₁ = p₂\n*   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)\n*   m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n*   2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\n*   T₂_classical = 2T₁_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical = 1 GeV\n\n### 5. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². The kinetic energy T is E - m₀c². From this, we derive the relation for momentum: (pc)² = T(T + 2m₀c²).\n\nAgain, by conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂:\n*   (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²\n*   T₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²) = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁ and the rest-mass energies are m₁c² = 198 GeV and m₂c² = 99 GeV.\n*   T₁(T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁)((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\n*   T₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(3 - T₁ + 198)\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)(201 - T₁)\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 201T₁ - 3T₁ + T₁²\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁ + T₁²\n*   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n*   600T₁ = 603\n*   T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation for T₁ is:\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nTo express the answer in MeV, we use the conversion 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
