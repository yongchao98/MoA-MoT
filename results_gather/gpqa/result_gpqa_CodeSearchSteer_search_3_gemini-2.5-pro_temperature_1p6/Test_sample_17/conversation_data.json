    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\nwhere `nₓ` and `nᵧ` are the number densities of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nThis can be rewritten in terms of abundances relative to hydrogen (H):\n\n`[X/Y] = ([X/H] - [Y/H])`\n\nwhere `[X/H] = log₁₀(nₓ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₓ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex`\n*   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex`\n\nWe can use the relationship `[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁` to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for Star 1, `[Si/H]₁`.\n\n`0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0`\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 dex`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex`\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex`\n\nSimilarly, we use the relationship `[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂` to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for Star 2, `[Si/H]₂`.\n\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂`\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex`\n\n### **4. Determine the Ratio of Silicon Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. In this context, this refers to the ratio of their silicon abundances (the ratio of silicon number density to hydrogen number density). Let this ratio be `R`.\n\n`R = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`\n\nTo find this ratio, we can take the logarithm:\n\n`log₁₀(R) = log₁₀((nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁) - log₁₀((nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂)`\n\nFrom the definition of `[X/H]`, we can express `log₁₀(nₓ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ` as `[X/H] + log₁₀(nₓ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`.\n\n`log₁₀(R) = ([Si/H]₁ + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - ([Si/H]₂ + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n\nThe solar silicon abundance term `log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ` cancels out:\n\n`log₁₀(R) = [Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂`\n\nNow, substitute the values we calculated:\n\n`log₁₀(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm:\n\n`R = 10⁰.⁶`\n`R ≈ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The extra information provided in the problem, such as the stellar masses and the absolute abundances of Mg and Fe in the Sun, is not needed for this calculation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms (abundances) in the photosphere of Star 1 to Star 2 is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
