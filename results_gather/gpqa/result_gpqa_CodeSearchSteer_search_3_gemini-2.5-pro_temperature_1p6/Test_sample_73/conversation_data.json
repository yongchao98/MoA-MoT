    "The decay of a single atomic nucleus follows an exponential distribution, which has a \"memoryless\" property. This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already been observed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past 50 minutes.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The probability of decay `P` within a time `t` is given by the formula: `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can plug these values into the formula:\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nTo find the decay constant `λ`, we would take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can substitute the expression for `λ` we found earlier:\n`P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68)/100) * 150)`\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`, the equation becomes:\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n\nSince `e` and `ln` are inverse functions, they cancel each other out:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
