    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Core Physics\n\nThe problem relates the population of two energy levels of an atom to the temperature of the environment. Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this relationship is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n```\nN_a / N_b = (g_a / g_b) * exp(-(E_a - E_b) / (k * T))\n```\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_a` and `N_b` are the number of atoms in states `a` and `b`.\n*   `g_a` and `g_b` are the statistical weights of the states (we can assume the ratio `g_a / g_b` is a constant `C`).\n*   `E_a` and `E_b` are the energies of the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Ratio's Behavior\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (`N_1 / N_2`) *decreases* when the star has spots. When the star has spots, its effective temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K.\n\nLet's analyze how the ratio `R = N_a / N_b` changes with temperature `T`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `a` is the higher energy level (`E_a > E_b`)**. The ratio is `R = N_higher / N_lower`. The term `-(E_a - E_b)` is negative. If temperature `T` decreases, `1/T` increases, and `-(E_a - E_b) / kT` becomes more negative. Therefore, `exp(...)` decreases, and the ratio `R` decreases.\n\n*   **Case 2: `a` is the lower energy level (`E_a < E_b`)**. The ratio is `R = N_lower / N_higher`. The term `-(E_a - E_b)` is positive. If temperature `T` decreases, `1/T` increases, and `-(E_a - E_b) / kT` becomes more positive. Therefore, `exp(...)` increases, and the ratio `R` increases.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio *decreases* as the temperature *decreases*. This matches **Case 1**. Therefore, we can conclude that Level 1 is the higher energy level and Level 2 is the lower energy level.\n\nSo, the ratio of interest is `R = N_1 / N_2 = N_higher / N_lower`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n\n`ΔE = E_1 - E_2 = h * c / λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` (Planck's constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` (speed of light) = 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nWe will need the value `ΔE / k`, where `k` (Boltzmann constant) is 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n```\nΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\nΔE / k = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.381e-23)\nΔE / k ≈ 99,420 K\n```\n\n### 4. Calculate the Factor of Change\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios: `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\nThe temperatures are:\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nLet's write the expression for the factor:\n```\nR_nospots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nR_spots   = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n```\nNow, plug in the values:\n```\nFactor = exp[ -99420 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99420 * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99420 * (-500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99420 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 1.506 ]\nFactor ≈ 4.508\n```\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
