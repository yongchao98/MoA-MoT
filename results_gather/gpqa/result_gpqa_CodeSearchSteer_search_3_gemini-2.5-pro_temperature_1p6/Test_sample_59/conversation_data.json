    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the \"proper time\" in the context of special relativity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Distance\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. The distance to it is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means it takes light 163,000 years to travel from there to Earth.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Journey Time from Earth's Perspective\n\nFrom an observer on Earth's point of view, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud is the distance divided by the speed.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n\nTime as measured from Earth (t):\n`t = d / v`\n`t = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)`\n\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in a year, this simplifies to:\n`t ≈ 163,000.0208 years`\n\nSo, from an Earth-based observer's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time for the Astronaut (Time Dilation)\n\nDue to the effects of time dilation, time passes much more slowly for the astronaut traveling at near the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n`t_astronaut = t_earth * √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t_astronaut` is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   `t_earth` is the time measured by an observer on Earth.\n*   `v` is the spacecraft's velocity.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, though for this problem it's more direct to calculate the inverse.\n\n`√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²) = √(1 - 0.99999987²) `\n`√(1 - 0.99999987²) ≈ 0.0005099`\n\nNow, we can find the astronaut's time:\n\n`t_astronaut = 163,000.0208 years * 0.0005099`\n`t_astronaut ≈ 83.11 years`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe 22-year-old astronaut will experience approximately 83.11 years of travel. The astronaut has a lifespan of 150 years, giving them 128 years of life from the age of 22. Since the journey takes about 81 years from their perspective, they will survive the trip and will be approximately 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival.\n\nOf the choices given, 81 years is the closest approximation to the calculated journey time for the astronaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
