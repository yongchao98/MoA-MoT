    "To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key principle of Einstein's special theory of relativity. This is necessary because classical velocity addition (simply adding the two speeds) does not apply to light.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames and velocities:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary observer's frame of reference.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** This is the glass, moving at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n    *   **Speed of light in the moving medium (u'):** The speed of light *relative to the glass* is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The formula is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   **Speed of the moving medium (v):** The glass moves at velocity `v` relative to the lab.\n    *   **Speed of light in vacuum (c):** The problem specifies to set `c=1`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n\n    u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c²)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of light as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of light relative to the moving medium (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n3.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    *   We are given `c = 1`.\n    *   The speed of light in the glass is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n    *   The speed of the glass is `v`.\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1²)\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n    To remove the fractions within the expression, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)\n    u = (n/n + n*v) / (n + n*v/n)\n    u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)\n\nThis result matches option C. The phenomenon described, where the speed of light in a moving medium is measured, is related to the famous Fizeau experiment, which was one of the early experimental results supporting the theory of relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
