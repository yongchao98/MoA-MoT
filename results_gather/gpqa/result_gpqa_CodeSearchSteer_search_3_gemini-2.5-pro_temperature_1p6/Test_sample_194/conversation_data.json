    "### Analysis of the Planetary System\n\nTo determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet, we must first establish the geometric conditions that allow for both a transit (the planet passing in front of the star) and an occultation (the planet passing behind the star).\n\n1.  **System Inclination**: The problem states that two planets share the same circular orbital plane. This means they share the same orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight. We can determine this inclination from the data provided for the first planet.\n\n2.  **Impact Parameter**: The impact parameter (`b`) is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the midpoint of a transit, measured in units of the star's radius. A transit is generally considered to occur if the planet's center passes across the stellar disk, which corresponds to an impact parameter `b ≤ 1`.\n\n3.  **Relating Parameters**: The impact parameter is defined by the formula: `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Determine the System's Geometry**: For the first planet, we have `b1 = 0.2`. Using the formula, we can write:\n    `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`.\n    This equation links the semi-major axis (`a1`) and the shared inclination (`i`) of the first planet.\n\n2.  **Condition for the Second Planet**: For the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter (`b2`) must also be less than or equal to 1. To find the *maximum* possible orbital period, we need to find the *maximum* possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`). This occurs at the limit of the transit condition, which is `b2 = 1`.\n    `1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s`.\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can now set up a ratio of the two equations from steps 1 and 2 to solve for the relationship between `a1` and `a2_max`:\n    `(a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s` / `(a1 * cos(i)) / R_s` = `1 / 0.2`\n    By canceling out the common terms (`cos(i)` and `R_s`), we get:\n    `a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`.\n    This shows that the maximum semi-major axis for the second transiting planet is 5 times that of the first planet. Notably, the radii of the star and the planets are not needed for this calculation, as they cancel out.\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). This can be expressed as `P² ∝ a³`. We can use this relationship to find the period of the second planet (`P2_max`).\n    `(P2_max / P1)² = (a2_max / a1)³`\n    Given `P1 = 3 days` and `a2_max / a1 = 5`, we can solve for `P2_max`:\n    `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 days * (5)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 * (5 * sqrt(5))`\n    `P2_max = 15 * 2.236...`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54 days`\n\nBased on this calculation, the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
