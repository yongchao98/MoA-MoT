    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift of an object for its Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the cutoff wavelength for light penetrating Earth's atmosphere.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ_rest)**: The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) spectral line is part of the Lyman series of hydrogen, occurring when an electron transitions from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. Its rest wavelength is approximately 1216 Ångströms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff (λ_obs_min)**: Earth's atmosphere, particularly ozone, absorbs most incoming ultraviolet radiation. This atmospheric absorption creates a \"cutoff,\" preventing UV light with wavelengths shorter than about 3200-3500 Å from reaching ground-based telescopes. While there isn't a single sharp cutoff, direct ground-based observations become practically impossible below this range. For a Damped Lyman-alpha system, for instance, direct ground-based observations are restricted to redshifts of approximately z > 1.7.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The cosmological redshift, denoted by *z*, stretches the wavelength of light as it travels from a distant source to an observer. The relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given by the formula: `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`. To find the minimum redshift, we need to find the value of *z* that shifts the 1216 Å Lyα line just into the observable window.\n\nUsing a conservative minimum observable wavelength of ~3500 Å from the ground:\n\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_obs = 3500 Å\n*   z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\n*   z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n*   z ≈ 2.878 - 1\n*   z ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 1.9. Therefore, a Lyman-alpha absorption system must have a redshift of at least z ≈ 1.9 for the 1216 Å line to be shifted to a wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
