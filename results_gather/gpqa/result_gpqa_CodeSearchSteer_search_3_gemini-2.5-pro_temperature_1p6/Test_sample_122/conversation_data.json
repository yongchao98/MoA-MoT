    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because the supernova ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time for the ejecta will pass slower than for an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s\n*   **Proper time in ejecta's frame (Δt₀):** 50 s\n*   **Speed of light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s\n\n**2. Understand the Physics:**\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This effect, called time dilation, is significant at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nThe key is to first calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame, and then use that time to find the distance the ejecta travels from the Galaxy's perspective.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor, represented by the Greek letter gamma (γ), quantifies the magnitude of time dilation. The formula is:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   v = 60,000 km/s\n*   c = 300,000 km/s\n*   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n*   v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n**4. Calculate Time Dilation (Δt):**\nNow, we find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt) using the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\n*   Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51.03 seconds pass in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**5. Calculate the Distance:**\nFinally, calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame.\n\nDistance = velocity × time (in the Galaxy's frame)\nDistance = v * Δt\nDistance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\nDistance ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis calculated distance is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. If we assume the Lorentz factor was rounded to 1.02 for the problem, the calculation would be:\nDistance = 60,000 km/s * (1.02 * 50 s) = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
