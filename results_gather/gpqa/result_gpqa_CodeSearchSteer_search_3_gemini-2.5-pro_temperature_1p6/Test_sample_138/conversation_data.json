    "The reaction described involves treating a compound with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water. These reagents generate nitrous acid (HONO) *in situ*. This specific reaction is a well-known method for the synthesis of α-diketones (1,2-diketones) from ketones.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds by the oxidation of the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) of a ketone. The ketone's α-methylene group (a -CH₂- group next to the C=O) is converted into a second carbonyl group.\n\nLet's analyze the two reactions:\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A starting material `A` reacts to form `4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione`. This product is an α-diketone. To form this product via α-oxidation, the starting material must have been a ketone with one of the carbonyl groups already present. Therefore, `A` must be **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. The reaction oxidizes the methylene group at the C-2 position, adjacent to the existing carbonyl group at C-1.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** A starting material `B` reacts to form `5-methylhexane-2,3-dione`. This is also an α-diketone. Applying the same logic, the starting material must have been a ketone with a carbonyl group at either position 2 or 3. The most plausible starting material is **5-methylhexan-2-one**. In this molecule, the ketone at C-2 activates the adjacent methylene group at C-3, which is then oxidized to yield the 2,3-dione.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct starting materials are:\n*   **A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**\n*   **B = 5-methylhexan-2-one**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
