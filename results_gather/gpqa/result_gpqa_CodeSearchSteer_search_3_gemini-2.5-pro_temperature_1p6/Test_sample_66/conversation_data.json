    "This problem can be solved by applying the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the System's State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by the ket $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Relate Total and Individual Angular Momentum:** The total orbital angular momentum operator for the z-component, $\\hat{L}_z$, is the sum of the individual operators for each electron:\n    $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of the Z-Component:** When measuring the eigenvalues of these operators, the eigenvalues must also add up. The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_z$ is $m\\hbar$, while the eigenvalues of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ are $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$ respectively. Therefore, a fundamental selection rule for the quantum numbers is:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Problem:**\n    *   The system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. This means that any measurement of the individual z-components must yield results ($m_{l1}, m_{l2}$) that sum to -1.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1. So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in a state where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's check if this desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system:\n    $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\n    This result, -2, is not equal to the system's total magnetic quantum number, $m=-1$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The state described by $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$ is an impossible outcome for a system whose total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This is because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\nThe expansion of the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$ in terms of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ only contains terms for which $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. Specifically, the expansion is a superposition of the states $|m_{l1}=0, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=0\\rangle$. The state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ does not appear in this expansion, so its probability amplitude is zero.\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
