    "For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is given by a spherically symmetric quadratic function of the radial distance `r`. The energy eigenvalues for this system are quantized and can be expressed in terms of a principal quantum number, n, which can take any non-negative integer value (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy of a given state is determined by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω.\n\nHere, `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant, and `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe different energy levels are characterized as follows:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy state of the system.\n    E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level, known as its degeneracy (g_n), is determined by the number of ways the integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of three non-negative integers (n = n_x + n_y + n_z). The formula for the degeneracy is:\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2.\n\nFor the third excited state, we set n=3. The degeneracy is calculated as:\ng₃ = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10.\n\nThese 10 states correspond to the following combinations of the quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z):\n*   (3,0,0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states\n*   (2,1,0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states\n*   (1,1,1): 1 state\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
