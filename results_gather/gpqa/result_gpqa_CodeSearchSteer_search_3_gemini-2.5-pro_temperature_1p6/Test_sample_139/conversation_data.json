    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B:**\nThe melting point of Substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n*   Given the value is \"very close to 277 K,\" Substance B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W:**\nThe reaction of Substance X with liquid Y releases Gas W. A key clue is that a molecule of Gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   A Deuterium (D or ²H) atom contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n*   The violent reaction suggests the release of hydrogen gas, and the presence of heavy water (B) and the neutron/proton count strongly points to Gas W being **D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of the Reaction and Substance X:**\n*   Substance X reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce a gas (W=D₂) and a precipitate (G). Heating G produces B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal hydride reacting with water.\n*   The prompt states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D). Thus, X is a deuteride.\n*   The reaction that produces D₂ gas is the reaction of a deuterated hydride with heavy water. For example: Metal-Deuteride + D₂O → Metal-Hydroxide-d + D₂. The precipitate G would be the resulting deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating would decompose and release heavy water (D₂O).\n*   The problem mentions that X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n*   A crucial clue is the reaction with a keto acid. The product of this reaction contains only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (containing a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) has three oxygen atoms.\n*   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A reduction of a keto acid with LiAlH₄ would result in a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl, -OH, groups), which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a milder reducing agent and typically only reduces ketones, not carboxylic acids. The product of its reaction with a keto acid would still have three oxygen atoms (a hydroxy acid).\n*   Therefore, the more powerful reducing agent is implicated. Substance X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those elements.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). It is present as 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13). It is present as 1 atom.\n*   **Atomic Masses (approximate integer mass for calculation):**\n    *   Mass of Deuterium (D or ²H) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n*   **Sum of masses for the lightest element (Hydrogen):**\n    *   There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n*   **Sum of masses for the heaviest element (Aluminum):**\n    *   There is 1 aluminum atom.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass of Aluminum) + (Total mass of Deuterium) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
