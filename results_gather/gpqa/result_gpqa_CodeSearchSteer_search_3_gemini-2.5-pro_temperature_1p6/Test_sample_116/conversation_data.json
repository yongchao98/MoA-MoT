    "Based on the analysis of the four compounds, here is the determination of which ones exhibit optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)CO2CH3. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are optically active, and methyl lactate exists as D and L optical isomers.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** With the formula (C6H5)2CO, benzophenone is the simplest diaromatic ketone. The molecule is symmetrical and does not possess a chiral center. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups, meaning it is only bonded to three groups. Due to its symmetry, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond, gives the molecule a plane of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while compounds 3 and 4 are not. Therefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
