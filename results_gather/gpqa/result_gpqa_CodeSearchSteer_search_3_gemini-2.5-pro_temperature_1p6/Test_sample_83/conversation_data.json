    "When solving high-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods, the problem is often converted into a large system of ordinary differential equations. The solution to this system involves a matrix exponential function, which is then approximated by a fractional, or rational, function.\n\nThe key factor in converting the resulting sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the ability to decompose this fractional approximation into a sum of simpler terms through a partial fraction expansion. This decomposition splits the single large computational problem into several smaller, independent linear algebraic systems. These independent systems can then be solved simultaneously on different processors, which is the essence of the parallel algorithm. Each processor handles one of the terms from the partial fraction expansion, allowing for concurrent computation and significantly speeding up the total solution time.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n*   **C) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation**: This mathematical technique directly enables the division of the problem into independent sub-tasks suitable for parallel processing.\n\nThe other options are less central to the parallelization strategy:\n*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions**: This typically complicates, rather than enables, parallelization.\n*   **B) Stability analysis**: This is a crucial requirement for any numerical algorithm (sequential or parallel) but is not the mechanism for converting one to the other.\n*   **D) Complex roots of fractional approximation**: The nature of the roots (whether real or complex) affects the details of the partial fraction expansion but is not the fundamental principle that allows for parallelization. Some methods are specifically designed to use only real arithmetic.\n\n<<<C>>>"
