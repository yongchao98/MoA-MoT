    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion. They account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, c, meaning the field experienced at an observation point **r** at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{tr}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nThe subscript \"tr\" signifies that all terms inside the brackets—the distance vector **d**, its magnitude *d*, and the charge's velocity **v**—must be evaluated at the retarded time *tr*.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, the denominator can be rewritten:\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the scalar potential V gives:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option A precisely. It's also worth noting that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by the formula $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which can be verified using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because it uses a plus sign in the denominator, which is inconsistent with the Liénard-Wiechert formulation.\n- **Option C** incorrectly uses the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the retardation effects of a moving charge, and it uses the instantaneous distance *r* instead of the retarded distance *d*.\n- **Option D** is incorrect for the same reasons as C and additionally presents a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n\n<<<A>>>"
