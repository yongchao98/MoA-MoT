    "Here is the analysis of each option to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, the one with greater mass will have stronger gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material more tightly, a phenomenon known as gravitational compression. This compression leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth but made of the same \"stuff\" will be compressed more by its own gravity and will have a density *greater* than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as the previous point, this planet has less mass and therefore weaker gravity. With less gravitational compression, its materials will be less compacted, resulting in an overall density that is *lower* than Earth's 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the four scenarios, the planet described in option (c) is the only one that would have a density definitively higher than Earth's density of 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n<<<A>>>"
