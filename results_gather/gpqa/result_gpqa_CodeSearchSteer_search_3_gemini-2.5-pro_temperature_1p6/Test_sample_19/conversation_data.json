    "The impulse approximation is a foundational concept in nuclear physics that simplifies complex many-body interactions. It treats the interaction of a projectile (like a lepton) with a nucleus as a sum of independent interactions with each of the individual nucleons. This approximation hinges on the idea that the interaction is very rapid and involves a large momentum transfer. The correct set of assumptions that jointly imply this approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the primary assumption. It posits that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, ignoring more complex interactions like meson-exchange currents where the probe interacts with the forces between nucleons.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption, often associated with the *Plane Wave* Impulse Approximation (PWIA), means that the incoming probe and the outgoing struck nucleon do not interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is also referred to as neglecting initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI). More advanced models, like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA), relax this assumption but it is core to the basic impulse approximation framework.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** During the brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the nucleon is treated as if it is a free particle, unbound by the nuclear potential. This \"neglect-of-binding\" is a central part of the approximation and is considered valid when the collision time is extremely short.\n\nThe third statement, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks within the nucleon, is related to a different level of approximation. It concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, which determines the nucleon's form factors, rather than the behavior of the nucleon as a whole within the nucleus during the scattering event. The impulse approximation can be and is used in relativistic frameworks where the internal quark structure is treated relativistically.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
