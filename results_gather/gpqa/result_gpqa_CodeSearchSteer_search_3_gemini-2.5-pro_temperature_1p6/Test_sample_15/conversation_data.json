    "An organic compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and typically lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters ((3aR,7aS)) and around a double bond ((E)). The designation of a specific enantiomer indicates that the molecule is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral meso compound. Meso compounds are optically inactive due to this internal symmetry.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It has two chiral centers, but it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer, and they are non-superimposable. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a -CH2-CH=CH- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2-CH= portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and thus optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three stereocenters. Assuming the \"s\" notation refers to a *cis* arrangement where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring, the molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotational symmetry (C3) and three planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a chiral center and does not have any other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
