    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r) within a sphere of radius R, we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume V.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. We need to calculate ∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates gives zero for r > 0. However, the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where the divergence is undefined. Because of this singularity, the standard Divergence Theorem cannot be directly applied to the entire sphere.\n\nTo handle the singularity, we can apply the Divergence Theorem to a volume V' which is the sphere of radius R excluding a small sphere of radius ε around the origin. Within this volume V', the vector field is well-defined and its divergence is zero.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem for the volume V' states:\n∫ᵥ' (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nSince ∇ ⋅ **f** = 0 within V', the volume integral is zero. The boundary of V' consists of two surfaces: the outer sphere of radius R (S_R) and the inner sphere of radius ε (S_ε). Therefore, the total flux is the sum of the flux through the outer sphere and the flux through the inner sphere.\n\n∮ₛ_ʀ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) + ∮ₛ_ε (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = 0\n\nThe normal vector for the surface integral points outward from the volume. For the outer sphere S_R, the normal is **r̂**. For the inner sphere S_ε, the normal pointing out of V' is -**r̂**.\n\nSo, ∮ₛ_ʀ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) - ∮ₛ_ε (**f** ⋅ d**S'**) = 0, where d**S'** has the outward normal **r̂**.\nThis implies that the flux through the outer sphere is equal to the flux through the inner sphere.\n\nLet's calculate the flux through a sphere of any radius 'a':\nThe surface element on a sphere is d**S** = a² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\nThe dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/a² **r̂**) ⋅ (a² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**) = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nThe surface integral (flux) is:\n∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫₀²π [-cos(θ)]₀π dφ = ∫₀²π (1 - (-1)) dφ = ∫₀²π 2 dφ = 4π.\n\nThis result is independent of the radius of the sphere. Therefore, the flux through the outer sphere of radius R is 4π.\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the field throughout the entire sphere of radius R is equivalent to the total flux emanating from the sources within the volume. Since the only source (singularity) is at the origin, the integral is equal to the flux through the surface enclosing it. The divergence of the field (1/r²) **r̂** is more accurately represented by 4π times the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, 4πδ³(**r**). The volume integral of this delta function over a sphere containing the origin is 1, so the integral evaluates to 4π.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
