    "To solve this problem, we need to follow two main steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots.**\n    The star's brightness is at its maximum when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The brightness is at its minimum when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. The amplitude of the variation is the relative difference between these maximum and minimum brightness levels.\n\n    The flux (brightness) emitted per unit area of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴, where T is the effective temperature.\n\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with an effective temperature T_eff = 6000 K, faces the observer. We can normalize this flux to 1.\n        F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction of its area (the filling factor, f = 0.20) covered by cooler spots and the rest (1 - f = 0.80) at the normal photospheric temperature.\n        *   Temperature of spots, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n        *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts.\n        *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n    The relative flux drop, or amplitude (A), is calculated as:\n    A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    A = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    A = 1 - (1 - f) - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 5000 K\n\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    A = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]\n    A = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]\n    A ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\n    A ≈ 0.1035\n\n2.  **Determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude.**\n    When a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit (the amplitude of the signal) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n    Transit Depth (A) = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n    We need to find the radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) that produces a transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots (A ≈ 0.1035).\n\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~0.39\n    B) ~0.11\n    C) ~0.07\n    D) ~0.32\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.32 is a very close match to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
