    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires deductive reasoning based on the provided reactions and spectral data. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactions\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C) to form product **1**. The spectral data for product **1** indicates a ketone (IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹) and has a ¹H NMR spectrum. Adamantane derivatives are known to undergo cage rearrangements under such harsh conditions.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product **1** is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. This means product **2** is an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product **2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This two-step process is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to form carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones).\n\n### Step 2: Deduce the Structures of the Intermediates\n\n1.  The ozonolysis in Reaction 3 indicates that product **2** must contain a C=C double bond.\n2.  Since product **2** is formed by the reduction of product **1**, and the MPV reduction converts a ketone to an alcohol without affecting a C=C bond, product **1** must be an **unsaturated ketone**.\n3.  The ¹H NMR spectrum of product **1** shows a signal at 4.79 ppm with an integration of 2H. This is characteristic of two equivalent vinylic protons, which points to a symmetrical `–CH=CH–` group within the molecule. The presence of this group is consistent with product **1** being an unsaturated ketone.\n4.  Ozonolysis of the symmetrical `–CH=CH–` group in product **2** (the unsaturated alcohol) will cleave this bond and form two aldehyde (`–CHO`) groups. This results in product **3**, which is a **dialdehyde alcohol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Coupling Pattern for Product 3\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product **3** (excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton). In a dialdehyde alcohol, the aldehyde protons (`–CHO`) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing around 9-10 ppm in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe splitting pattern of an aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon atom (`Cβ`), following the n+1 rule, and can be influenced by long-range coupling in rigid systems.\n\nLet's denote the aldehyde proton as H_ald and the adjacent carbon as Cβ. The structure around the aldehyde group is `...-Cγ-Cβ-CHO`.\nThe splitting pattern options are:\n*   **Triplet:** This would occur if Cβ is a CH₂ group and only 3-bond coupling is considered (n=2, so n+1=3).\n*   **Pentet:** This would require coupling to four equivalent protons on Cβ, which is impossible.\n*   **Doublet of Triplets:** This pattern arises when H_ald couples to two different sets of protons: one single proton and one pair of equivalent protons. This is consistent with a structure where Cβ is a CH group (coupling to one proton, Hβ, creating a doublet) and Cγ is a CH₂ group (coupling to two protons, Hγ, creating a triplet), with both ³J (H_ald-Hβ) and long-range ⁴J (H_ald-Hγ) couplings being significant. The resulting pattern would be each peak of the doublet being further split into a triplet. This `...-CH₂-CH-CHO` fragment is plausible in a rearranged cage molecule.\n*   **Triplet of Triplets:** This would imply coupling to two different pairs of equivalent protons.\n\nGiven the rigid, caged nature of adamantane and its rearrangement products, long-range (⁴J) coupling is common. A doublet of triplets is a complex pattern that arises from such specific structural arrangements. The logical deduction points to a scenario where the aldehyde proton is coupled to one proton on the adjacent carbon and two protons on the next carbon in the framework.\n\nThus, the local structure required is **`...–CH₂–CH–CHO`**. This leads to the aldehyde proton signal being split into a doublet by the single proton on the adjacent carbon, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two protons on the next carbon.\n\n<<<D>>>"
