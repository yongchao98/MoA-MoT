    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-step Synthesis of Product 4**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr₃, this combination of reagents also achieves the same outcome. The acetic anhydride can activate the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate, which then reacts with bromine at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano and the ester groups (the α-carbon).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon to form a carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    *   This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br), displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation.\n        *   Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br\n    *   The problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" which means the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    *   This carbanion undergoes a favorable intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the structure of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. We assume the spectrum is taken at room temperature, where the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nDue to rapid ring-flipping and rotation around single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry plane dictates the equivalence of the protons. The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires us to consider diastereotopicity.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** The C1 carbon of the ring is a prochiral center (bonded to four different groups: CN, COOEt, C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring). This makes the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ of the ethyl group diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C1:** This carbon has no protons.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 atom lies on the plane of symmetry. The two geminal protons on C4 are located symmetrically with respect to the plane and are therefore chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes the proton set on C2 equivalent to the set on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic because of the prochiral center at C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This results in two signals from these four protons: one for the H-2/H-6 \"axial-like\" protons and one for the H-2/H-6 \"equatorial-like\" protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The proton set on C3 is equivalent to the set on C5. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 5 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 3 (ethyl group) + 5 (ring) = 8.\n\nThere are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product 4.\n\nFinal answer corresponds to option D.\n<<<D>>>"
