    "The experiment described points to a key process in the adaptive immune response occurring within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence:\n*   **Oral Antigen Delivery:** Administering the rotavirus proteins orally targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), of which the Peyer's patches are a major component.\n*   **Peyer's Patches:** These are known sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. The presence of fluorescence indicates the viral proteins have successfully reached these sites.\n*   **Proliferating Cells:** An active immune response involves the rapid division (proliferation) of lymphocytes that have recognized a specific antigen.\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain:** This is the most crucial piece of information. The variable region of an antibody determines its specificity for an antigen. An increase in variability within this region in a proliferating B cell population is the hallmark of affinity maturation.\n\nThis process of introducing numerous point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes is called **somatic hypermutation (SHM)**. It occurs in activated B cells within specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are found in Peyer's patches. The goal of SHM is to generate B cells that produce antibodies with progressively higher affinity for the antigen.\n\nHere is why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (though it can be activated by antibodies) and involves a cascade of proteins to fight infection. It does not involve mutating B cell genes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B and T cell receptors by combining V, D, and J gene segments. However, it occurs in primary lymphoid organs (like the bone marrow for B cells) *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen, not in proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch *after* antigen exposure.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, which alters the antibody's function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). It does not affect the variable region, and therefore does not generate the observed variability in the antigen-binding site.\n\nTherefore, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches is a direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
