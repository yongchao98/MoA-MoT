    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) relative to the total cobalt concentration. This calculation relies on the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand, thiocyanate ([SCN⁻]).\n\nThe species present in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species. The fraction of each species can be calculated using the following formulas, which are derived from the equilibrium expressions.\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (α₂) is given by the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nFirst, we will calculate each term in the denominator using the provided data:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nThe individual terms are:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, we calculate the sum in the denominator (Σ):\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe term in the numerator corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, approximately 16.9% of the cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n<<<B>>>"
