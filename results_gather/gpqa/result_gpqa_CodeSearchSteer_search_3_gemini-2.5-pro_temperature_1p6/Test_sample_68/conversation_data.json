    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we must first calculate the characteristic distance the $X^0$ particle travels in the bubble chamber before decaying. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and relativistic momentum.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Relativistic Parameters\n\nFirst, we determine the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$), which describes the time dilation and length contraction effects for an object moving at relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m c^2$). In particle physics units where energy and mass are often given in GeV and GeV/$c^2$ respectively, the formula simplifies to:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass $m_{X^0} = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nThe particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is dilated by this factor compared to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The proper lifetime is given as $\\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}$s.\n\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_{0} \\approx 7.918 \\times (8\\times10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length\n\nThe mean decay length ($L$) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by multiplying the particle's velocity ($v$) by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$). For relativistic particles, it's often more convenient to calculate it using the particle's momentum ($p$). The formula is $L = \\frac{p}{m}\\tau_0$.\n\nFirst, we find the momentum $p$:\n\n$p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} \\text{ GeV/c} \\approx \\sqrt{729 - 11.628} \\text{ GeV/c} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV/c}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay length $L$:\n\n$L = \\frac{p}{m} c \\tau_{0} \\approx \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV/c}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. In this context, \"observing\" a decay means distinguishing the decay products from the initial particle's track. This is only possible if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$.\n\nThe probability that a particle survives for a distance $x$ before decaying follows an exponential decay law: $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$. The fraction of decays that can be observed (i.e., those that occur at a distance greater than the resolution $d$) is given by this probability evaluated at $x=d$.\n\nWe require this fraction to be at least 30%:\n\n$e^{-d/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the boundary condition for the resolution $d$, we solve for the equality:\n\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx - (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the minimum requirement for the detector) that would still allow for the observation of at least 30% of the decays. Comparing our calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m to the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe value calculated is closest to option C. The discrepancy of about 9% might stem from slight imprecision in the provided problem data. However, option C is the only one in the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<C>>>"
