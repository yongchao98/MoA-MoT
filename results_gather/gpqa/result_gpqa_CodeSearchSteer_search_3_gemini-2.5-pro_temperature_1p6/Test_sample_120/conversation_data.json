    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method in organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The key principles governing this reaction are:\n\n*   **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are considered \"soft\" nucleophiles and react under conditions similar to basic nucleophiles. They attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is an S_N_2-type reaction.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom where the new bond is formed, characteristic of an S_N_2 mechanism.\n\nFollowing these principles, we can determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi).\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Me₂CuLi provides a methyl anion (Me⁻) as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**:\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and the oxygen atom.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is part of two ring systems, making it a quaternary carbon.\n    *   Carbon C6 is bonded to C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon.\n    *   The methyl nucleophile will attack the less sterically hindered carbon, which is C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group at C6 occurs via an S_N_2 mechanism, leading to an inversion of the stereocenter.\n    *   The initial configuration at C6 is (S). Following the attack and inversion, the new stereocenter will have an (R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction and will retain their original (R) configurations.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide cleaves, and upon workup, an alcohol (-OH) group is formed at C1. The stereochemistry at C1, which was (R), is retained.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   The -OH group is at C1. There is also a methyl group at C1 from the starting material.\n    *   The incoming methyl group attaches to the former C6, which becomes C2 in the new IUPAC numbering of the product.\n    *   The methyl group from the original C3 is now at C4.\n    *   The methyl group from the original C4 is now at C5.\n    *   The product is, therefore, a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   The stereochemistry is as follows:\n        *   C1 remains (R).\n        *   C2 (originally C6) inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   C4 (originally C3) remains (R).\n        *   C5 (originally C4) remains (R).\n\nThe final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
