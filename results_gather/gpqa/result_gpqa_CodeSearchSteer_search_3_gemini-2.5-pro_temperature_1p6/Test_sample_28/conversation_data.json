    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that halts the production of the gene's protein product or creates a completely non-functional version of it. Analyzing the provided mutant sequences reveals the nature of each change and its probable impact.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** This sequence contains a *missense mutation*. The third codon is changed from `CTC` to `TAC`. This substitutes one amino acid (Leucine) for another (Tyrosine) in the resulting protein. While this change could potentially disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed; the protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** This sequence contains a *nonsense mutation*. The third codon is changed from `CTC` to `TAA`. `TAA` is a stop codon, which signals the cellular machinery to terminate protein synthesis prematurely. This mutation, occurring so early in the gene, will result in a severely truncated, two-amino-acid-long peptide that is virtually certain to be non-functional. This type of mutation is very likely to \"knock out\" the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** This sequence contains significant alterations. If interpreted as a single base insertion, it would cause a *frameshift mutation*. A frameshift alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from that point forward and usually leading to a premature stop codon downstream. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** This sequence appears to have multiple changes, including a missense mutation and the deletion of a codon. An in-frame deletion of one amino acid, while potentially damaging, is often less severe than a mutation that stops translation entirely or alters the entire reading frame.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense (Mutant 2) and frameshift (Mutant 3) mutations are highly effective at inactivating a gene. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 is a clear, unambiguous point mutation that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is a classic and highly reliable way to ensure a non-functional product, as the resulting mRNA is often targeted for destruction by a cellular process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Given the options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 provides the highest probability of eliminating the targeted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
