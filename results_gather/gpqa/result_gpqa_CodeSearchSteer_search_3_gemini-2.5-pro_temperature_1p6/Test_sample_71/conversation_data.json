    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n\nThe reaction of a 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compound with sodium iodide is a method for generating a highly reactive diene, which can then be trapped in a Diels-Alder reaction. While the provided reagent, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is obscure, a common and structurally similar reagent used for this purpose is 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene (α,α,α',α'-tetrabromo-o-xylene). This reagent reacts with NaI to form o-xylylene (also known as o-quinodimethane), a reactive diene. It is probable that the provided reagent is either a typo for this common precursor or an alternative precursor that also generates o-xylylene.\n\no-Xylylene acts as the diene in a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction). The 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds and acts as the dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one o-xylylene molecule adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This forms a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**. The addition is expected to occur on the *exo* face of the norbornadiene system due to steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)\n\nAqueous acid is used to deprotect tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group at the C7 position of the bicyclic core is cleaved to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction transforms Product 1 into **Product 2**, the corresponding alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2\n*   **Reagent:** Sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\n\nThis set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The hydroxyl group at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). This yields **Product 3**, which is the large double-adduct with a ketone group at the C7 position.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3\n*   **Condition:** Heated at 150°C\n\nHeating a Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This is entropically favored as it increases the number of molecules. In this case, the double-adduct (Product 3) breaks down.\nThe retro-Diels-Alder reaction regenerates the original diene and dienophile components. The dienophile, however, has been modified in the preceding steps.\n\n*   The two o-xylylene molecules are released.\n*   The central bicyclic core is left behind. It started as 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, was converted to the alcohol, and then to the ketone. The retro-Diels-Alder reaction reforms the double bonds. Therefore, the initial product of this step is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n\nHowever, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable. An analysis of its highly symmetric structure (C₂ᵥ point group) reveals that it has only **two** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: the two bridgehead protons {H1, H4} are one set, and the four vinyl protons {H2, H3, H5, H6} are the second set. Since \"2\" is not among the given options (A) 7, B) 10, C) 8, D) 4), this cannot be the final product.\n\nThe heating step must cause a further transformation. Thermolysis of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one can lead to elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene, or it can undergo skeletal rearrangement. Given the options, a plausible rearrangement is to a stable C₇H₆O isomer. One such isomer is **benzaldehyde** (C₆H₅CHO). This deep skeletal rearrangement is considered plausible in the context of advanced organic chemistry problems where non-obvious transformations lead to simple, stable products.\n\n**Analysis of Final Product 4 (Benzaldehyde)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** There are 6 hydrogen atoms in total.\n*   **Chemical Equivalence:** We need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    1.  The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment.\n    2.  The two ortho-protons (adjacent to the -CHO group) are equivalent to each other due to the molecule's plane of symmetry.\n    3.  The two meta-protons are also equivalent to each other.\n    4.  The single para-proton (opposite the -CHO group) is in a unique environment.\n\nTherefore, there are four chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in benzaldehyde.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, benzaldehyde, is 4.\n\n"
