    "The problem is to find the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`).\n\nThis is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded sphere are equivalent to the field and potential of the original charge `q` plus an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    *   The image charge `q'` has a magnitude of `-q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `d'` from the center of the sphere, where `d' = R²/d`. The image charge lies on the same line connecting the center and the external charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The correct method involves understanding that the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at distance `d` from the center is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point.\n\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and its image `q'` (at `d' = R²/d`) is:\n        `distance = d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the position of `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n    *   Now, we can calculate the potential energy `U`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because as the charge `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge on the sphere builds up gradually. The work done is an integral that results in this factor.\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d² - R²) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression matches option D. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the potential energy of the system is lower than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n\n<<<D>>>"
