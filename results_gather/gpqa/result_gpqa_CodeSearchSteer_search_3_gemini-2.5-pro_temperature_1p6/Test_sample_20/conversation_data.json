    "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate questions:\n1.  Which compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism?\n2.  Which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism?\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible isomers, which typically involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the position of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is generally required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens can participate in tautomerization. In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound, which strongly favors its formation.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a C=C double bond, and each carbon of the double bond is attached to a hydrogen atom and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). There are no chiral centers in the molecule. It has a center of inversion and is achiral, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the answers for both parts:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
