    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe annihilation process is governed by the law of conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    The system initially consists of a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄).\n    *   The proton is at rest, so its energy is its rest energy, `E_p = m_p * c²`.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Therefore, its energy is approximately its rest energy, `E_p̄ = m_p̄ * c²`.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are equal. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   So, the total initial energy is `E_initial ≈ 2 * m_p * c² = 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV`.\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻.\n    *   All four particles have the same rest mass, `m_A`, and will have the same total energy, `E_A`, due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is zero).\n    *   The rest energy of particle A is given as `m_A * c² = 300 MeV`.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula `E_A = γ * m_A * c²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: `E_final = 4 * E_A = 4 * γ * m_A * c²`.\n\n**2. Equating Initial and Final Energy**\n\nAccording to the conservation of energy:\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`1876 MeV = 4 * γ * (300 MeV)`\n\n**3. Solving for the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ`:\n`γ = 1876 MeV / (4 * 300 MeV)`\n`γ = 1876 / 1200`\n`γ ≈ 1.5633`\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity (v)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nWe need to solve for `v`:\n`γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)`\n`1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ²`\n`v²/c² = 1 - (1 / γ²)`\n`v/c = sqrt(1 - (1 / γ²))`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `γ`:\n`v/c = sqrt(1 - (1 / 1.5633²))`\n`v/c = sqrt(1 - (1 / 2.444))`\n`v/c = sqrt(1 - 0.409)`\n`v/c = sqrt(0.591)`\n`v/c ≈ 0.7688`\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately `v ≈ 0.77c`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
