    "The derivation performed in the thought process is confirmed by multiple physics resources. Specifically, a problem sheet from a university course confirms the method of using the conservation of total energy.\n\n1.  **Define the system and states:** The system is a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We consider two states:\n    *   State 1: The mass is at its maximum amplitude, $x=A$. At this point, its velocity is zero ($v=0$), and its potential energy is maximum, $U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   State 2: The mass is at the equilibrium position, $x=0$. At this point, its potential energy is zero ($U=0$), and its speed is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of Conservation of Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of the system, which is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring, must be conserved. The total relativistic energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, which is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its relativistic kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$). The total energy of our system is therefore $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy in State 1:**\n    *   At $x=A$, $v=0$, so the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy is $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy in State 2:**\n    *   At $x=0$, $v=v_{max}$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The total energy is $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\n    *   According to the conservation of energy, the total energy in State 1 equals the total energy in State 2.\n        $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n    *   Divide by $mc^2$ to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, solve for $v_{max}$. First, invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B. As a check, in the classical (non-relativistic) limit where the speed of light $c$ is considered infinite, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ becomes very small. Using a binomial approximation, the relativistic formula correctly reduces to the classical result, $v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, which is option D.\n\n<<<B>>>"
