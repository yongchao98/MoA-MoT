    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of each type of bond. The chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's expand this structure:\n```\n      CH3                   CH3               CH3\n       |                     |                 |\n  H3C--C==CH -- CH2 -- CH -- CH2 -- CH==C -- CH3\n   1   2     3      4       5     6    7   (with attached methyls)\n```\nNow, let's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 2 (in the first (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (in CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (in the last (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 6 (in the first (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (in CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (in the last (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBased on the expanded structure, we count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds (`=`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** The backbone has 8 carbons. The number of bonds in the backbone (single or double) is 8 - 1 = 7. We have 2 double bonds, so there are 7 - 2 = 5 single bonds in the chain. In addition, there are methyl groups attached: two on the first carbon, one on the fourth, and two on the seventh. This accounts for 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C single bonds connecting the methyl groups to the main chain. Therefore, the total number of C-C single bonds is 5 + 4 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule. It's the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization = (9 × C-C) + (2 × C=C) + (22 × C-H)\nΔH_atomization = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of a compound can be calculated using the following equation, which applies Hess's Law:\n\nΔH_f = [ (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of constituent elements in their standard state) ] - (Enthalpy of atomization of the molecule)\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the enthalpies of atomization for the elements (12 moles of Carbon and 22 moles of Hydrogen).\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon, C(s) → C(g): 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   The bond energy of H-H (H2 → 2H) is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to form 2 moles of H atoms. The enthalpy of atomization for hydrogen is for the formation of 1 mole of H atoms (½ H2 → H), so it is 100 kJ/mol / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nSum of ΔH_atomization for elements = (12 mol × ΔH_atom(C)) + (22 mol × ΔH_atom(H))\nSum of ΔH_atomization for elements = (12 × 1000 kJ) + (22 × 50 kJ)\nSum of ΔH_atomization for elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of formation of the molecule:\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert the Answer to the Correct Units**\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/mol or kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22:\nMolar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) = **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get 11.45 kJ/g. This value matches option B.\n\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   B) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   C) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization, not formation)\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong)\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>"
