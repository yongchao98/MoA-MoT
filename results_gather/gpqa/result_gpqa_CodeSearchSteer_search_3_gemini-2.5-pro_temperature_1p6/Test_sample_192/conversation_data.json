    "The solution to this problem involves a few steps of logic based on the fundamental relationship between stellar parallax and distance.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This relationship is expressed as:\n`plx ∝ 1/r`\n\nThis means that as the distance to a star increases, its observed parallax angle decreases.\n\n**2. Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) observed varies with parallax as:\n`N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\nWe can substitute the relationship from step 1 into this equation to express the number of stars as a function of distance `r`:\n`N ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵`\n`N ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis tells us that the *total* number of stars within a certain distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of that distance.\n\n**3. Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\nThe question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is asking for the stellar number density with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of the total number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r` (dN/dr).\n\nGiven `N ∝ r⁵`, let's introduce a constant of proportionality `k`, so `N = k * r⁵`.\nNow, we find the derivative:\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to the fourth power of the distance:\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r⁴\nB) ~ r⁵\nC) ~ r³\nD) ~ r²\n\nThe correct choice is A because the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
