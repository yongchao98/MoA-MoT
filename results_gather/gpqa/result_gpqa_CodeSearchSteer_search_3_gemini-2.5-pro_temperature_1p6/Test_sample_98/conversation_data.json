    "To identify the unknown compound, we will analyze the provided spectral data and compare it with the expected data for each of the possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows two key absorption peaks:\n1.  **A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broadness is a hallmark feature distinguishing it from the sharper O-H stretch of an alcohol.\n2.  **A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a saturated, dimerized carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth of these peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group type but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\nThe 1H NMR data provides the most crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers through the complex splitting patterns. The `n+1 rule` states that a signal for a proton will be split into `n+1` peaks by `n` equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent groups of protons, complex multiplets are observed.\n\nWe are looking for a compound that has two specific complex signals:\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of 2 protons (giving the **t**riplet).\n    *   A group of 3 protons (giving the **q**uartet).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of 2 protons (giving the first **t**riplet).\n    *   A different group of 2 protons (giving the second **t**riplet).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Proposed Structures\n\nLet's analyze the methine protons (CH groups) in each structure, as they are the most likely candidates to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Structure A) `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`** and **D) `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`**: These molecules contain methyl and ethyl groups, but no single proton has the required three distinct neighboring proton groups to produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`. For instance, in structure D, the proton at C4 is coupled to a CH group (1H, doublet) and a CH3 group (3H, quartet), which would result in a doublet of quartets (dq), not a `dtq`. The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH2 group (2H, triplet) and a CH group (1H, doublet), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). Neither A nor D matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Structure B) `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`**: In this structure (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid), the methine proton at C3 is coupled to two CH2 groups and one CH group. This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. However, the methine proton at C2 is only coupled to one CH group and one CH2 group, resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). This structure accounts for the `dtt` signal but not the `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C) `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`**: The IUPAC name for this compound is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. Let's analyze the splitting for its two methine protons, labelled H(b) and H(e) below:\n\n    `HOOC-CH2(h)-CH(e)(CH2(f)CH3(g))-CH(b)(CH2(c)CH3(d))-CH3(a)`\n\n    1.  **Analysis of proton H(b):** This proton is on carbon 4. Its neighbors are on adjacent carbons:\n        *   The **`CH3`** group at C5 (3 protons, H(a)) -> splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n        *   The **`CH`** group at C3 (1 proton, H(e)) -> splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The **`CH2`** of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons, H(c)) -> splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for proton H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first described signal.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of proton H(e):** This proton is on carbon 3. Its neighbors are on adjacent carbons:\n        *   The **`CH2`** group at C2 (2 protons, H(h)) -> splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   The **`CH`** group at C4 (1 proton, H(b)) -> splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The **`CH2`** of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons, H(f)) -> splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for proton H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second described signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, is consistent with all the provided spectral data. It is the only compound that contains two different methine protons whose environments would lead to a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
