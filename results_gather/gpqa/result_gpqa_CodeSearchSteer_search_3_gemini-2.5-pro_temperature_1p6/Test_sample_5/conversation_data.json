    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass *m* in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = ½ kr² + ³⁄₂ kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard conversions to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = (½ + ³⁄₂)kx² + ½ ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction.\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx² = ½ (4k)x²\nVᵧ(y) = ½ ky²\n\nThe energy of a 2D quantum system with a separable potential is the sum of the energies of the independent 1D systems.\nE = Eₓ + Eᵧ\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = ½ kₑff q² are given by Eₙ = (n + ½)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = √(kₑff/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\nThe energy is Eₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)).\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\nThe angular frequency is ωᵧ = √(k/m).\nThe energy is Eᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m).\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of Eₓ and Eᵧ:\nE = Eₓ + Eᵧ = (nₓ + ½)2ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2(nₓ + ½) + (nᵧ + ½)]ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + ³⁄₂)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
