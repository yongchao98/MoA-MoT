    "To identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and compare it with the structures of the given options.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    This formula provides the types and numbers of atoms present, which all potential structures must match. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one, fitting the total of 5.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is indicative of a C=O double bond. This frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** A broad signal integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift is significantly downfield, suggesting it is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH₂-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm) is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n\n### **Evaluation of Proposed Structures**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate (CH₃CH₂COO-C₆H₄-NH₂):** This structure is an isomer but would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group of the propionate at a much more upfield position (~2.2-2.6 ppm) because it is attached to a carbonyl group, not an oxygen atom. This contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃):** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ - Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester C=O, matching the IR bands.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has an ethyl group giving a triplet and a quartet at the expected shifts for an ethyl ester. It has a primary amine group consistent with the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. It has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring which would produce two doublets, and the electron-donating/withdrawing nature of the substituents explains the observed chemical shifts.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide (CH₃CH₂O-C₆H₄-CONH₂):** This structure has a 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which would lead to a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets. Also, the carbonyl stretch for an amide typically appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (CH₃CH₂O-C₆H₄-NHCHO):** This compound is a secondary amide. It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. It would also show a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) around 8.0-8.5 ppm and an N-H proton signal, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the IR and ¹H NMR data, all evidence points to the compound being ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
