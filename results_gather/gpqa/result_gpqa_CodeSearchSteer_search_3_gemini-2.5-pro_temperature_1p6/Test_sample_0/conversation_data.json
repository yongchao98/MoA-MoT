    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their natural linewidths. The natural linewidth (ΔE) of a quantum state is determined by its lifetime (τ) due to the time-energy uncertainty principle.\n\nThe uncertainty principle states:\nΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). The linewidth, or the uncertainty in the energy of the state, can be approximated as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis phenomenon is also known as lifetime broadening or natural broadening. States with shorter lifetimes have broader energy widths, while those with longer lifetimes have narrower widths.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual widths:\nEnergy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nEnergy Difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\nEnergy Difference > (6.582 + 0.6582) x 10⁻⁷ eV\nEnergy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's compare this required energy difference with the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only energy difference that is sufficiently large to allow for a clear resolution of the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
