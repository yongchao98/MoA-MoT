    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X:**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   A very downfield, broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   Two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) aromatic ring. The downfield position of the 8.0 ppm signal indicates these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The remaining signals represent an alkyl substituent:\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a methine (-CH-) group attached directly to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a single proton (the methine).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** Putting the pieces together, the alkyl group is a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃], which is attached to a para-substituted benzoic acid. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n    *   The reaction involves treating Compound X with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Red phosphorus and HI are known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes, specifically to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction essentially removes the oxygen atoms and replaces them with hydrogen atoms. The general reaction is R-COOH → R-CH₃.\n    *   For example, acetic acid is reduced to ethane using this reagent.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Final Product:**\n\n    *   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring are inert under these conditions.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Options:**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene matches the deduced final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
