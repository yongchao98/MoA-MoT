    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, let's break down the information provided about the compound:\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The ring itself has the formula -C₆H₄-.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** This functional group must be part of the substituents. A carbonyl group contains one carbon atom.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring. This serves as one of the substituents.\n\nBased on these facts, the most plausible structure is a haloacetophenone. This structure consists of a halogen on the benzene ring and an acetyl group (-COCH₃) as the other substituent. This combination satisfies all the conditions: a di-substituted benzene ring, a total of 8 carbons (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group), a carbonyl group (in the acetyl group), and a halogen attached to the ring.\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options. The substitution pattern on the benzene ring (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the appearance of the aromatic proton signals.\n\n*   **Para (1,4) substitution:** This is a symmetrical arrangement. It would result in two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Due to the symmetry, the spectrum typically shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Ortho (1,2) or Meta (1,3) substitution:** These patterns are less symmetrical and would produce a more complex spectrum with four separate signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (usually ~6.5-8.5 ppm) and incorrectly suggests only one aromatic proton. This data does not correspond to the described compound.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to two protons (2H). This pattern is characteristic of a para-substituted aromatic ring. The signal at 2.3 ppm is a singlet integrating to three protons (3H), which is the classic signal for a methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH₃). Protons on carbons attached to an aromatic ring typically appear between 2.0-3.0 ppm. The chemical shifts in the aromatic region are downfield, consistent with the deshielding effect of two electron-withdrawing groups (the carbonyl and the halogen). This data perfectly matches the structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    The signal at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. While an aldehyde contains a carbonyl group, this data does not fit a structure with an aromatic-halogen bond and 8 total carbons correctly.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option shows no signals in the aromatic proton region, indicating it is not an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly describes a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
