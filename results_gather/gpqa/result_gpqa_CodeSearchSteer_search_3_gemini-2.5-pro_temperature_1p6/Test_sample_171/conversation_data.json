    "The reasoning behind the answer is based on the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N<sub>j</sub>) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N<sub>i</sub>) is given by:\n\n(N<sub>j</sub> / N<sub>i</sub>) = (g<sub>j</sub> / g<sub>i</sub>) * exp [ - (E<sub>j</sub> - E<sub>i</sub>) / (k * T) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   (g<sub>j</sub> / g<sub>i</sub>) is the ratio of the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   (E<sub>j</sub> - E<sub>i</sub>) is the energy difference between the levels, which we can call ΔE.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe term \"excitation\" typically refers to this ratio. The problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio (N<sub>j</sub> / N<sub>i</sub>) for star 1 is double the ratio for star 2.\n\nLet T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> be the temperatures of star 1 and star 2, respectively. We can set up the following relationship:\n\n(N<sub>j</sub> / N<sub>i</sub>)₁ = 2 * (N<sub>j</sub> / N<sub>i</sub>)₂\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann equation into this relationship:\n\n(g<sub>j</sub> / g<sub>i</sub>) * exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₁) ] = 2 * (g<sub>j</sub> / g<sub>i</sub>) * exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₂) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g) are properties of the specific iron atom's energy levels and are the same for both stars, so the term (g<sub>j</sub> / g<sub>i</sub>) cancels out:\n\nexp [ - ΔE / (k * T₁) ] = 2 * exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₂) ]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln { exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₁) ] } = ln { 2 * exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₂) ] }\n\n- ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln { exp [ - ΔE / (k * T₂) ] }\n\n- ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = [ ΔE / (k * T₂) ] - [ ΔE / (k * T₁) ]\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]\n\nCombine the terms in the brackets:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. This means the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into our derived equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
