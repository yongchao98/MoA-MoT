    "To determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must first deduce the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the given reaction sequence.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This is a standard protection reaction that converts the aldehyde into a 1,3-dithiolane. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This forms a lithiated dithiolane, B, which acts as a nucleophilic carbanion. This type of reaction, creating a nucleophilic acyl anion equivalent, is a key part of the Corey-Seebach reaction.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. An ethyl group from bromoethane replaces the proton that was removed from the C2 position. Since there was already an ethyl group from propionaldehyde at C2, the product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithioacetal (dithiolane) C back to a carbonyl compound. The carbon atom that was part of the dithiolane ring (C2) is converted back to a carbonyl group (C=O). Since this carbon is bonded to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone, D, is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction, a method used to convert ketones and aldehydes into alkenes.\n    *   **Ylide formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. A strong base (BuLi) then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus, creating a phosphorus ylide. The ylide formed is Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Wittig reaction**: The ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the Wittig reagent (the ylide). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   **Final Product E**: The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃PO. The final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### ¹³C-NMR Analysis of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n\nThe structure of the final product E is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C = C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecule. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond, and also a plane of symmetry co-planar with the double bond (assuming a planar conformation).\n\n*   **Carbon Environments**:\n    1.  **sp² Carbons**: There are two carbons in the central double bond (C3 and C4). Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two carbons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n    2.  **Ethyl Groups**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Because of the high symmetry, all four ethyl groups are in identical chemical environments.\n        *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Within the four equivalent ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce a second signal.\n        *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a third signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀H₂₀), the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene results in only three unique carbon environments.\n\nThe expected signals are:\n1.  One signal for the two equivalent sp² carbons (C=C).\n2.  One signal for the four equivalent sp³ methylene carbons (-CH₂-).\n3.  One signal for the four equivalent sp³ methyl carbons (-CH₃).\n\nThis gives a total of **3** signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
