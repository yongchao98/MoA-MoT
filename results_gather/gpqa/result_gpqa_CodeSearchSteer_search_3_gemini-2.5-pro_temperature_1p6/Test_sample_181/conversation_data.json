    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the behavior of a space-charge-limited current under a specific set of ideal conditions. To determine which statement is true, each condition must be carefully examined against the established theory.\n\nThe derivation of the Mott-Gurney law is based on the following primary assumptions:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device**: The model assumes that the current is transported by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes. This means it is not applicable to two-carrier (bipolar) devices.\n*   **Trap-Free Insulator**: The equation is valid for a material that is perfectly insulating, with a negligible intrinsic carrier concentration. Furthermore, it assumes there are no defect states (traps) within the energy gap that can immobilize the injected charge carriers. The presence of traps significantly alters the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts**: The model requires \"Ohmic\" or non-rectifying contacts, which means there is no energy barrier to the injection of charge carriers from the electrodes into the semiconductor. This ensures that the supply of carriers is not a limiting factor. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would violate this condition.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current**: The derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the charge transport is driven entirely by the electric field (drift current). The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately combines the key requirements: a single-carrier system, the absence of traps, Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier), and a current dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is specifically for single-carrier devices.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the space-charge-limited current is fundamentally a drift-dominated phenomenon. Neglecting the drift current would contradict the basis of the model.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of an ideal Ohmic contact.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes all the necessary conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
