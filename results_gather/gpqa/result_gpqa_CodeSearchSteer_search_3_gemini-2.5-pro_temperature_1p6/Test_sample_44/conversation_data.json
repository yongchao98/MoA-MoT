    "This problem requires calculating the energies for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, let's define the energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a given quantum state *n* is:\n\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n\nThe problem provides a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n\n*   E_n = n² * E\n\nThis gives us the energy for each level:\n*   n=1: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   n=2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   n=3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   n=4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSpin-1/2 particles are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by both the energy level quantum number (n) and the spin quantum number (m_s = +1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### System Energy Calculations\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles in their respective states.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   The lowest energy level (n=1) can hold two particles. Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E.\n*   The next two particles fill the second energy level (n=2). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n*   E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\n*   E_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the next-lowest energy configuration. There are two possibilities to consider for a single-particle promotion from the ground state:\n*   **Promotion 1:** Move a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Promotion 2:** Move a particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nAnother possibility is promoting a particle from the first excited state configuration:\n*   Move the particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n\nComparing these possible excited state energies (18E, 20E, and 22E), the lowest value above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Thus, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
