    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow these steps.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its host star's temperature (T_eff) and radius (R_star), as well as the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*) and albedo (A). The relationship is:\n\nT_eq ∝ T_eff * √(R_star / a)\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * √(R_star / a₁)] / [T_eff * √(R_star / a₂)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_eff and R_star are constant and cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n### 2. Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift in the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (*a*). For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (inclination i = 90°), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods, the formula is:\n\nK = M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, *a*:\n\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K₂²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms for G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Determining the Input Ratios\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   **Mass Ratio:** M_p1 = 7 M_earth and M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K):** The radial velocity is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute these ratios back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25/49) * (9/16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nNow, use this ratio to find the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
