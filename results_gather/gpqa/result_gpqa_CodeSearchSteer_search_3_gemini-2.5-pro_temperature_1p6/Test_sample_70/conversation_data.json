    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of radiative equilibrium and celestial mechanics.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance (a) from its host star, assuming the planets have the same albedo. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the planet's average distance from its star. This gives the relationship:\n\nP² ∝ a³ or a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nBy combining these two relationships, we can establish a direct correlation between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that the orbital periods of the planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
