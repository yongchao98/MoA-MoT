    "An N-sided polygon with a very large number of sides (N approaching infinity) and a constant apothem 'a' approximates a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius 'r' of the circle.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function. The angle θ for the minima is given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ ≈ m * (λ / D)\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   m is a constant corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFrom the search results, the constants for the first two minima are approximately m₁ = 1.22 and m₂ = 2.23.\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle, so r = a. The diameter of the aperture is therefore D = 2r = 2a.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n1.  **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * (λ / D) = 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\n2.  **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * (λ / D) = 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ/a) - (0.610 * λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 - 0.610) * (λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * (λ/a)\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option D. Using more precise values for the constants from the zeros of the Bessel function (1.2197 and 2.233) yields a result of approximately 0.5066 λ/a, confirming that D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
