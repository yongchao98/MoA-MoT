    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction (S_y) for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State**: The un-normalized spin state |ψ⟩ is represented by the column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ =\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State**: A quantum state vector must be normalized, meaning the inner product of the state with itself equals 1. First, we find the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket |ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ| = ( (3i)*, 4* ) = (-3i, 4)\n\n    Now, we calculate the inner product:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n    The normalization constant is 1/√25 = 1/5. However, we can also calculate the expectation value using the un-normalized state and divide by the normalization factor at the end.\n\n3.  **Define the Spin Operator S_y**: The spin operator for the y-direction is given by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n    S_y = \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value**: The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.\n\n    First, let's compute S_y|ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\n    Next, we compute the full bracket ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (-3i, 4) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{ħ}{2}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2} [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2} [12i^2 - 12]\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2} [-12 - 12]\n    = \\frac{ħ}{2} [-24] = -12ħ\n\n    Finally, we divide by the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = \\frac{-12ħ}{25}\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
