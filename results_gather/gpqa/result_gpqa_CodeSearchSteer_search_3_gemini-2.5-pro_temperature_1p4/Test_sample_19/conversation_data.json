    "The \"impulse\" approximation in nuclear physics rests on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a high-energy probe interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction is very fast and localized to a single nucleon.\n\nThe assumptions that collectively define this approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a foundational element, often called the one-body current approximation. It posits that the incoming probe interacts with just one nucleon at a time, and the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus are merely spectators.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particles interact with the spectator nucleons. This is a key part of what is known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), where final-state interactions (FSI) are neglected. In essence, the particles' paths are not distorted by the nuclear medium.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** The impulse approximation is valid at high energy and momentum transfers. This makes the interaction time so short that the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be considered negligible during the collision itself. The procedure is to determine the interaction for a free nucleon and then apply that within the nuclear context.\n\nThe assumption that the quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic is a separate consideration related to the modeling of the nucleon's internal structure and is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be used with both relativistic and non-relativistic models.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
