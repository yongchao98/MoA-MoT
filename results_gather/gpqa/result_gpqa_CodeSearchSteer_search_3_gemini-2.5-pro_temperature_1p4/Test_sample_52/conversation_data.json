    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Components from the Spectra:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This group contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the final molecular formula will be C*x*H*y*O2.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond). The splitting patterns described are \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by one other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group contributes C3H5 to the formula.\n    *   **¹H NMR - –CH3 signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No –CH2 signals:** The explicit absence of any signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups is a crucial clue that helps eliminate other possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 aromatic ring.\n    *   We have a C3H5 propenyl group.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and a methyl group (-CH3). These must form the second substituent. The only way to combine these without a -CH2- group is either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n        *   Ester/methyl fragment: C2H3O2\n    *   Total atoms = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2\n    *   **Total Formula = C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The other options are inconsistent with the spectral data. For instance, C12H14O2 (D) would require additional -CH2- groups (like in an ethyl ester) or more substituents on the ring, both of which are contradicted by the provided information.\n\n<<<B>>>"
