    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the equation:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states:\n\n**State 1: All spins are up**\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n*   E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n**State 2: All spins are down**\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n*   E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states have the same energy level, E = -3J.\n\n**State 3: Two spins are up, one is down**\nThere are three such configurations:\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n**State 4: One spin is up, two are down**\nThere are also three such configurations:\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n*   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nThese six states all share the same energy level, E = J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states, grouped by their energy levels (degeneracy):\nZ = Σ_i (degeneracy of state i) * e^(-βE_i)\n\nWe have two energy levels:\n*   E₁ = -3J with a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   E₂ = J with a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nTherefore, the partition function is:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
