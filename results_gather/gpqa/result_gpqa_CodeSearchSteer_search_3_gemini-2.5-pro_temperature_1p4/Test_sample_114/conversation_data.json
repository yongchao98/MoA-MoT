    "To determine the angle between the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron and positron before the collision. The energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²` and its momentum by `p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c`, where `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, and `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**For the electron:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n*   Energy (E_e) = 4 * mc²\n*   Momentum (p_e) = √((4mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(16m²c⁴ - m²c⁴)/c = √(15) * mc\n    This momentum is directed along the positive horizontal axis.\n\n**For the positron:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n*   Energy (E_p) = 2 * mc²\n*   Momentum (p_p) = √((2mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(4m²c⁴ - m²c⁴)/c = √(3) * mc\n    This momentum is directed along the negative horizontal axis.\n\n**Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n*   Total Energy (E_tot) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n*   Total Momentum (P_tot) = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * mc\n    The total initial momentum is entirely in the horizontal direction.\n\n### 2. Final State: Two Photons\nThe collision produces two photons. According to the problem statement:\n*   The two photons have equal energy (E_γ).\n*   One photon moves in the \"upper-right\" direction, and the other in the \"lower-right\" direction.\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation Laws\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n*   E_tot = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n*   6mc² = 2E_γ\n*   E_γ = 3mc²\nEach photon has an energy of 3mc².\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe momentum of a photon is given by `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n*   p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc\n\nThe total momentum must be conserved in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. Let θ be the angle each photon's path makes with the horizontal axis. Since one is \"upper-right\" and the other is \"lower-right\", their vertical momentum components are equal and opposite, and their horizontal components add up.\n\n*   **Vertical Momentum (y-direction):** The initial vertical momentum is zero. The final vertical momentum is `p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`. This is consistent and confirms the symmetric emission angles.\n\n*   **Horizontal Momentum (x-direction):** The total initial horizontal momentum must equal the total final horizontal momentum.\n    *   P_tot = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n### 4. Calculating the Angle\nWe can now solve for the angle θ by simplifying the equation for the conservation of horizontal momentum.\n\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. This angle is the sum of the angle of the upper photon (θ) and the magnitude of the angle of the lower photon (θ).\n*   Total Angle = θ + θ = 2θ\n*   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1 degrees ≈ 138.2 degrees\n\nThis value is very close to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<D>>>"
