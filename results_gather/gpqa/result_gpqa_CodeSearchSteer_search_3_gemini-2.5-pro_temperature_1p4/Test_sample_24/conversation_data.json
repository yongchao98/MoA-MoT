    "My analysis of the reactions is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol (pinacol) to a carbonyl compound is known as the Pinacol rearrangement. This reaction proceeds through a carbocation intermediate and often involves a 1,2-alkyl or aryl shift. When cyclic diols are used, this rearrangement can lead to ring contraction or expansion, forming spirocyclic systems. Specifically, acid-catalyzed rearrangement of decalin-diol derivatives is a known method to produce spiro[4.5]decanone structures. This supports the conclusion that reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** The rearrangement of an ether using a strong base like butyllithium (BuLi) is characteristic of a Wittig rearrangement. The search results confirm that there are different types, including the-Wittig and-Wittig rearrangements. The reaction of an ether with BuLi involves deprotonation to form a carbanion, followed by the migration of an alkyl or aryl group. Specifically, a-Wittig rearrangement involves the migration of a group from the ether oxygen to the adjacent carbanionic carbon. Applying this to reactant `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` (`Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`), deprotonation at the benzylic carbon (`-CH2-Ph`) by BuLi would generate the necessary carbanion. A subsequent-migration of the allylic group (`-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`) from the oxygen to the carbanion, followed by protonation, yields the product `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol` (`HO-CH(Ph)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`). The use of a ketone as reactant B is not consistent with the reagents (`BuLi`) which would act as a nucleophile to give a different product, not the simple alcohol shown. Therefore, B is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\nCombining these findings, reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` and reactant B is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
