    "To determine the correct option, we will calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction, the relative speed is not a simple subtraction. We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. The formula for the relative speed (v_rel) between two objects with velocities v₁ and v₂ as measured by a stationary observer is:\n\nv_rel = |v₁ - v₂| / (1 - (v₁v₂ / c²))\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate its energy (E₁):\n    E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate its energy (E₂):\n    E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total energy of the system (E_total):**\n\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nThese results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
