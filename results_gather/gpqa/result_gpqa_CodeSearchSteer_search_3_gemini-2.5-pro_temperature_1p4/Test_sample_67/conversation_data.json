    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. The expectation value of the magnetic moment of the particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the +Y axis) at a specific frequency, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin is aligned with the Z-axis. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the spin vector begins to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz⟩, therefore oscillates.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector, ⟨**S**⟩, in a magnetic field **B** is given by the equation:\n\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ (⟨**S**⟩ × **B**)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation shows that the spin vector precesses around the magnetic field vector **B** with an angular frequency of:\n\nω = γB\n\nThis angular frequency is the Larmor frequency.\n\nLet's break down the components. The magnetic field is **B** = B**ŷ**. The expectation value of the spin is ⟨**S**⟩ = (⟨Sx⟩, ⟨Sy⟩, ⟨Sz⟩). The cross product results in a set of differential equations:\n*   d⟨Sx⟩/dt = -γB⟨Sz⟩\n*   d⟨Sy⟩/dt = 0\n*   d⟨Sz⟩/dt = γB⟨Sx⟩\n\nTaking the time derivative of the third equation and substituting the first equation into it, we get:\n\nd²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨Sx⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨Sz⟩) = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is γB. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
