    "The reaction sequence and the final product have been determined through chemical principles, and this reasoning is well-supported by the search results.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1**\n    *   Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which will yield 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n    *   2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this strongly suggests a Favorskii rearrangement, which involves a ring contraction. This reaction converts the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone into a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a specific, bulky reducing agent used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   Therefore, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Analysis of Product 4: Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n    *   The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n    *   Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like reflection through this plane) or by rapid conformational changes are chemically equivalent. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n    *   Let's count the distinct sets of protons:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (one \"above\" the ring, one \"below\") are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. The same applies to C5. Due to the symmetry plane, the \"top\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"top\" proton on C5, and the \"bottom\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"bottom\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes the C3 and C4 positions equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the \"top\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent and the \"bottom\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing these up, we have 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
