    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 (⁶Li) nucleus, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass:**\nThe nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which is ⁶Li. The search results provide the atomic mass of ⁶Li. According to multiple sources, the relative atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122 atomic mass units (u). An atomic mass unit (u) is equivalent to 931.5 MeV/c².\n\nTo find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons from the atomic mass. The mass of an electron is approximately 0.000549 u.\n\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.000549 u = 0.001647 u\n*   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.015122 u - 0.001647 u = 6.013475 u\n\nNow, convert the rest mass to MeV/c²:\n\n*   m₀ = 6.013475 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u\n*   m₀ ≈ 5601.553 MeV/c²\n\nThe rest energy (E₀) is therefore approximately 5601.553 MeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe nucleus travels at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.571428\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γ * E₀).\n\n*   E = 3.571428 * 5601.553 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20005.54 MeV\n\n**4. Convert Energy to GeV and Compare:**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the total energy to GeV:\n\n*   E ≈ 20005.54 MeV / 1000 MeV/GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.00554 GeV\n\nThis value is very close to option B. Let's recalculate with higher precision to confirm.\n\n*   Atomic Mass of ⁶Li: 6.015122 u\n*   Mass of 3 electrons: 3 * 0.0005485799 u = 0.0016457397 u\n*   Nuclear Mass of ⁶Li: 6.015122 u - 0.0016457397 u = 6.01347626 u\n*   Rest Energy (E₀) in u: 6.01347626 u * c²\n*   Rest Energy in MeV: 6.01347626 * 931.494 MeV = 5601.52 MeV\n*   Lorentz Factor (γ): 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857\n*   Total Energy (E) = 5601.52 MeV * 3.57142857 ≈ 20005.4 MeV\n*   Total Energy (E) in GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 20.0054 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy might arise from the exact mass values or conversion factors used in the problem's source material. However, based on the standard values found, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer. Let's re-evaluate using the atomic mass directly, as this is a common practice in such problems if the ion's charge state isn't specified as fully stripped.\n\n*   Rest Energy from atomic mass: 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5603.08 MeV\n*   Total Energy = 3.571428 * 5603.08 MeV = 20011.0 MeV = 20.011 GeV\n\nThis result is still closest to 20.132 GeV. The small difference points to slightly different constants being used for the problem's options. Let's check the calculation if the answer 20.132 GeV were correct.\n\n*   E = 20.132 GeV = 20132 MeV\n*   E₀ = E / γ = 20132 MeV / 3.571428 = 5636.96 MeV\n*   m₀ = 5636.96 MeV / 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0515 u\n\nThis mass is slightly higher than the accepted mass of ⁶Li, but it is the energy that matches one of the provided options. Given the choices, there might be a rounding or a specific value for the mass of ⁶Li intended for this problem. Nevertheless, our calculation strongly points towards the answer being in the 20 GeV range.\n\nFinal check of calculation steps:\n*   v = 0.96c -> γ = 3.5714\n*   m₀(⁶Li nucleus) ≈ 6.0135 u -> E₀ ≈ 5601.5 MeV\n*   E = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.5714 * 5601.5 MeV ≈ 20005 MeV = 20.005 GeV\n\nThe closest answer is 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
