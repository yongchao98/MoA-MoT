    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Moles of H+ and OH- Ions\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 moles\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from H2SO4 (a diprotic acid):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since H2SO4 provides 2 H+ ions per molecule:\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.18 moles\n\n*   **Total Moles of H+:**\n    *   Total H+ = 0.10 mol (from HCl) + 0.18 mol (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.5 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per molecule:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L × 2 = 0.20 moles\n\n### 2. Determine the Heat Released from Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\n*   We compare the total moles of H+ (0.28 mol) with the total moles of OH- (0.20 mol).\n*   The OH- ions are the limiting reactant, so only 0.20 moles of water will be formed from the neutralization.\n*   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat of Neutralization (Q_neut):**\n    *   Q_neut = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of neutralization\n    *   Q_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 3. Determine the Heat Released from Precipitation\n\nIn this mixture, barium ions (Ba²⁺) from Ba(OH)₂ react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from H₂SO₄ to form a precipitate, BaSO₄.\n\nBa²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\n*   **Moles of Ba²⁺ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Moles = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 moles\n\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles\n\n*   The SO₄²⁻ ions are the limiting reactant for the precipitation. Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ precipitate will be formed.\n*   The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄ (also referred to as the heat of crystallization) is -4.5 kcal/mol.\n*   **Heat of Precipitation (Q_precip):**\n    *   Q_precip = Moles of BaSO₄ formed × Enthalpy of precipitation\n    *   Q_precip = 0.09 mol × (-4.5 kcal/mol) = -0.405 kcal\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy Change\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the heat released from neutralization and the heat released from precipitation.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy (ΔH):**\n    *   ΔH = Q_neut + Q_precip\n    *   ΔH = -2.74 kcal + (-0.405 kcal) = -3.145 kcal\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) -11.42 kcal\nB) -16.0 kJ\nC) -2.72 kcal\nD) -3.80 kcal\n\nThe calculated value of -3.145 kcal is closest to -2.72 kcal. The small discrepancy arises from slight variations in the standard enthalpy values used. For instance, if only the heat of neutralization is considered (-2.74 kcal), option C is the nearest answer. It is possible the contribution from the heat of precipitation is considered negligible or is ignored for the purpose of the question.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the closest option. The heat from neutralization alone is -2.74 kcal. This is very close to option C.\n\nFinal calculation confirms that the heat of neutralization is the primary contributor.\n*   Heat of Neutralization: -2.74 kcal\n*   Heat of Precipitation: -0.405 kcal\n*   Total Heat Released: -3.145 kcal\n\nGiven the options, option C, which primarily reflects the heat of neutralization, is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
