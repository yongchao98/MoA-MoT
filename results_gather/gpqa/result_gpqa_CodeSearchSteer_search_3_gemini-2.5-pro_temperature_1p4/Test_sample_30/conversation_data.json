    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group is an ortho-, para- director. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is p-nitrotoluene.\n    *   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n2.  **Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.** This step is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. While strong oxidizing conditions can lead to a carboxylic acid, the specific conditions for the next step strongly suggest the formation of an aldehyde. Controlled oxidation of toluene derivatives with manganese dioxide can yield benzaldehydes.\n    *   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n3.  **Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.** These are the classic conditions for a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. P-nitrobenzaldehyde, an aromatic aldehyde without α-hydrogens, reacts with the enolate of acetone. The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates under these conditions to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\nThe structure of product 3 is O₂N−C₆H₄−CH=CH−C(=O)−CH₃. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify all the symmetry elements it possesses.\n\n*   The conjugated system of the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group forces the main skeleton of the molecule to be planar.\n*   A molecule that is planar has at least one plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane containing all of its atoms.\n*   There is no rotational axis (Cₙ) that would leave the molecule unchanged upon rotation, as the p-nitrophenyl end is different from the acetyl end.\n*   There is no center of inversion (i).\n\nSince the only symmetry element possessed by the molecule, besides the identity element (E), is a single plane of symmetry (σ), it belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
