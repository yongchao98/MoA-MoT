By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability.

    "The process taking place is somatic hypermutation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence from the scenario:\n*   **Location:** The events occur in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. These are known sites for immune responses to gut antigens and contain germinal centers where B-cell maturation occurs.\n*   **Stimulus:** The immune system is responding to an antigen (rotavirus capsid proteins) delivered orally.\n*   **Cellular Activity:** Proliferating cells are isolated, which is characteristic of the clonal expansion of B cells in a germinal center after encountering an antigen.\n*   **Key Observation:** Sequencing reveals high variability specifically in the *variable heavy chain gene*. This is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM is a process that intentionally introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This process aims to produce B cells that can create antibodies with a higher affinity for the specific antigen, a process known as affinity maturation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** While CSR also occurs in germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM, it affects the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. CSR changes the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA) to alter its function, but does not change its antigen-binding specificity.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of proteins to eliminate pathogens. It does not involve genetic mutation in lymphocytes.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B-cell receptors *before* an antigen is encountered. It occurs in primary lymphoid organs like the bone marrow, not in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches in response to an active infection.\n\n<<<A>>>"
