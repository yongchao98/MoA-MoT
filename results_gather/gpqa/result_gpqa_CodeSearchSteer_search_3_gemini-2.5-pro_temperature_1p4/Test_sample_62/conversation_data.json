    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state. In the rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to the lowest vibrational quantum number (v=0) and the lowest rotational quantum number (J=0).\n    *   The problem asks for the momentum of a photon that allows the molecule to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". Photon absorption in a diatomic molecule follows specific selection rules. For a rovibrational transition (a change in both vibration and rotation), the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible. Therefore, the final state will have v=1 and J=1.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE):**\n    *   The energy of any state (v, J) in the non-rigid rotor model is given by: E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħw + B J(J+1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, w is the angular frequency, B is the rotational constant, and v and J are the quantum numbers.\n    *   Energy of the initial state (v=0, J=0): E_initial = (0 + 1/2)ħw + B(0)(0+1) = (1/2)ħw.\n    *   Energy of the final state (v=1, J=1): E_final = (1 + 1/2)ħw + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħw + 2B.\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) must equal the difference between these states: ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħw + 2B] - [(1/2)ħw] = ħw + 2B.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Constants:**\n    *   **Reduced Planck Constant (ħ):** ~1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   **Angular Frequency (w):** 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s (given)\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** ~3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        *   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 amu * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        *   I = μ * R²\n        *   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m (given)\n        *   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        *   B = ħ² / (2I)\n        *   B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n    *   First term (vibrational): ħw ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    *   Second term (rotational): 2B ≈ 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   ΔE = ħw + 2B ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    *   *Note:* The energy contribution from the rotational part is about 0.2% of the vibrational part, so it's very small. Simplified models often approximate the transition energy as just ħw.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\n    *   The energy and momentum of a photon are related by the formula E = pc.\n    *   Therefore, p = ΔE / c.\n    *   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated momentum, p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
