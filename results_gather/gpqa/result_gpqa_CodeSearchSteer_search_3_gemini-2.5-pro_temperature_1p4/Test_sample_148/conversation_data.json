    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since their combined integral is correct (1H) and spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals suggest the two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio. Protons in enantiomers are chemically identical in an achiral environment and would not show separate peaks. Protons in diastereomers, however, are chemically non-equivalent and are expected to have different chemical shifts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) trace shows two distinct, separable peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio that have different physical properties, allowing for their separation by chromatography. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is identical for both peaks and matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This confirms that the two compounds are isomers (they have the same mass), not a precursor or other impurity with a different chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular mass, which would be detected by the MS analysis.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This term refers to a procedural step in synthesis to improve reaction yield, not a chemical outcome that produces stable isomers. The product should still be a single compound.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. They are also indistinguishable in a standard NMR experiment, meaning they would produce a single set of peaks, not two.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most consistent explanation. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. They are also chemically distinct, which would result in different peaks in an NMR spectrum for corresponding protons. A common way for a mixture of diastereomers to form during peptide synthesis is through epimerization (the inversion of stereochemistry at one of a molecule's chiral centers). This side reaction would produce a diastereomer of the target peptide, leading to the exact observations described. The presence of two separable peaks at an *elevated* temperature in the LC analysis further strengthens this conclusion, as it suggests the isomers are configurationally stable and do not easily interconvert, which is characteristic of diastereomers formed by epimerization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two distinct species by both NMR and LC, coupled with the fact that they are isomers (possessing the same mass), overwhelmingly points to the presence of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
