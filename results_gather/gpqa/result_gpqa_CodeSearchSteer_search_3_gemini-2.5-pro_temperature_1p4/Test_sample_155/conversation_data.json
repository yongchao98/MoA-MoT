    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe overall reaction sequence in both cases is an anti-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This involves two steps:\n1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the epoxide.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The epoxide ring is opened by an acid-catalyzed reaction with water. This proceeds via a backside attack (anti-addition) of water on the protonated epoxide, resulting in a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups).\n\nThe combination of a syn-addition followed by an anti-addition results in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   Starting with a *trans* (E) alkene, the anti-dihydroxylation process results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   Starting with a *cis* (Z) alkene, the same anti-dihydroxylation process results in the formation of a racemic mixture. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns are achiral and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will separate into distinct peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, causing them to elute at different times.\n    *   Consequently, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
