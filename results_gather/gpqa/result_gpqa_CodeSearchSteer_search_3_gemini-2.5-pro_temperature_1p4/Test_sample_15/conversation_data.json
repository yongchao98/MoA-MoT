    "To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds listed are specific stereoisomers, so we are evaluating each one individually. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and typically lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ** (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule itself is planar with respect to the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them. This planarity acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. A compound that is a single enantiomer of a chiral substance is by definition optically active. The complex bicyclic structure does not possess symmetry elements that would render it achiral.\n\n3.  ** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3. Molecules with chiral centers that are overall achiral due to such symmetry are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n\n4.  ** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound mentioned above. It has two chiral centers and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound.\n\n5.  ** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon-1, which is a chiral center. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is attached to four different groups, making it a stereocenter. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ** (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group) and a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ** 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring are not bonded to four different substituents. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
