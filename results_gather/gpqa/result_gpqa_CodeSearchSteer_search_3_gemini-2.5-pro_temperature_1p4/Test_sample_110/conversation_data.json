    "The user wants to identify the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A Analysis\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate an alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no alpha-protons. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen). Therefore, the only available alpha-proton for deprotonation is at the C6 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n    *   The t-BuOK base deprotonates the ketone at C6, forming an enolate.\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After protonation (workup), the final product is formed.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The new substituent, `–CH2CH2COOCH2CH3`, is attached at C6.\n    *   To name the product as a propanoate derivative as given in the options, we identify the main chain as ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   The name is therefore `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). So, the attachment point is C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The original C1 (ketone group) is now at position 2 -> `2-oxo`.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now at position 3 -> `3-ethyl-3-methyl`.\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) also had a methyl group, which is now at position 1 -> `1-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This corresponds to product **A** in options A and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`). The alpha-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the NO2 group) are acidic and can be removed by a base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3CH=CHCN`), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (`CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`).\n    *   This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) yields the final adduct.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH3CH2CH(NO2)–CH(CH3)CH2CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The IUPAC name will be a derivative of hexanenitrile because the longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `C1`: Nitrile carbon\n        *   `C2`: `-CH2-`\n        *   `C3`: `-CH(CH3)-` -> `3-methyl`\n        *   `C4`: `-CH(NO2)-` -> `4-nitro`\n        *   `C5`: `-CH2-`\n        *   `C6`: `-CH3`\n    *   The complete IUPAC name for the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This corresponds to product **B** in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>"
