    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n### 1. Understand the Key Concepts\n\nTo find the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) of a relativistic particle, we need to consider time dilation. The particle's internal clock runs slower than the observer's clock in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is given in units of energy. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor (γ):** In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ. The observed lifetime is γτ. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by multiplying the particle's velocity (v) by its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula is `L = γ * v * τ`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\n\nA convenient combined formula for the mean decay length is `L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`, where `p` is the momentum, `m` is the mass, `c` is the speed of light, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `Γ` is the decay width. This can also be written as `L = γβ * (ħc / Γ)`, where `β = v/c`.\n\n### 3. List the Given Values\n\n*   Total Energy ($E_{X}$) = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass ($m_{X}$) = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1200 MeV/c²\n*   Decay Width ($\\Gamma_{X}$) = 320 MeV\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the momentum (p) of the particle.**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `pc`:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = (8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2$\n$(pc)^2 = 64,000,000 \\text{ MeV}^2 - 1,440,000 \\text{ MeV}^2$\n$(pc)^2 = 62,560,000 \\text{ MeV}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step B: Find the value for `ħc`.**\nThe physical constant `ħc` (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light) is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm (Mega-electron Volt · femtometer). One femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the proper decay length in the particle's rest frame (cτ).**\nThe proper decay length is `cτ = ħc / Γ`.\n$cτ = \\frac{197.3 \\text{ MeV·fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Step D: Calculate the mean decay distance (L) in the lab frame.**\nThe formula is `L = (pc / mc²) * (cτ)`.\n$L = \\frac{7909.5 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} * (0.6166 \\text{ fm})$\n$L \\approx 6.591 * 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Step E: Convert the result to meters.**\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
