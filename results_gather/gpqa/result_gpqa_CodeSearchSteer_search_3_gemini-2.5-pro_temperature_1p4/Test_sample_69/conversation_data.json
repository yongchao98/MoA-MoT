    "This chemical riddle contains several clues that are contradictory or contain factual inaccuracies, making a step-by-step deduction of all compounds impossible. However, by identifying the most chemically sound parts of the puzzle and evaluating the likely candidates for the final product, a logical conclusion can be reached.\n\n**Analysis of the Clues**\n\n1.  **D + B → H (Solvent):** The reaction of two gases in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent is a strong clue. A plausible reaction is the combination of sulfur dioxide (gas D) and chlorine (gas B) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is a liquid solvent.\n    *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **D = SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)**\n    *   **H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl Chloride)**\n\n2.  **C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid):** The hydrolysis of product C reforms solid A and produces two acids. If gas B is chlorine (Cl₂), this perfectly explains the formation of a strong acid and a weak acid through the disproportionation of chlorine in water.\n    *   **Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (weak acid)**\n    *   This strongly suggests **F = HCl** and **G = HClO**. For this reaction to occur upon the addition of C to water, and for solid A to be reformed, C must be a substance that readily releases chlorine into the water.\n\n3.  **A(s) + 8B(g) → C(bright red):** This step indicates that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of chlorine gas to form a bright red product C. Both the stoichiometry (1:8) and the color are likely inaccuracies in the riddle, as such a reaction is not common. The key takeaway is that C is a chlorine-containing compound derived from A.\n\n4.  **C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous):** This is the final step needed to identify the molecular symmetry of product E. Based on the identities above, this reaction is:\n    *   **C + 2SO₂ → E**\n\n**Identifying Product E and its Symmetry**\n\nGiven the inconsistencies in the riddle, E must be deduced by considering common \"extremely hazardous\" chemical products that could be formed from these reactants. Many of the most hazardous simple inorganic molecules, such as phosgene (COCl₂), sulfur tetrafluoride (SF₄), and chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃), have **C₂v symmetry**.\n\nWhile the exact identity of E cannot be definitively determined from the flawed reaction `C + 2SO₂ → E`, the prevalence of the C₂v point group among highly hazardous chemical compounds makes it the most probable answer intended by the puzzle. For example, molecules like phosgene, chlorine trifluoride, and sulfur tetrafluoride are all extremely hazardous and all possess C₂v symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
