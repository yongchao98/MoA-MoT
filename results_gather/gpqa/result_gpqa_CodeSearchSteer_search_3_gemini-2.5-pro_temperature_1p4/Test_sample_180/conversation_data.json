    "The question asks for the approximate ratio of the solar neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band to the flux in the 800-900 keV band, under the hypothetical condition that the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain has stopped.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe primary sources of solar neutrinos are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has three main branches:\n*   **pp-I:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos.\n*   **pp-II:** Produces monoenergetic ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV and 384 keV.\n*   **pp-III:** Produces high-energy ⁸B neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** Produces neutrinos from the decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O, with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### The Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of ⁸B neutrinos ceases. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, are assumed to remain as they were.\n\n### A Critical Insight: Neutrino Detection\n\nAt first glance, the 800-900 keV band contains the extremely intense 861 keV line from ⁷Be neutrinos, while the 700-800 keV band contains only flux from the much weaker continuous spectra. This would suggest a tiny ratio. However, a crucial point is how these low-energy neutrinos are detected on Earth.\n\nExperiments like Borexino detect these neutrinos via neutrino-electron elastic scattering (`ν + e⁻ → ν + e⁻`). In this process, the incoming neutrino transfers some of its energy to the electron. For a monoenergetic neutrino of energy Eν, the recoiling electron does not have a single energy but a continuous spectrum of energies up to a maximum \"Compton-like edge.\" This maximum recoil energy is T_max = Eν / (1 + mₑc² / 2Eν).\n\nFor the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino, the maximum kinetic energy it can transfer to an electron is:\nT_max ≈ 0.861 MeV / (1 + 0.511 MeV / (2 * 0.861 MeV)) ≈ 0.66 MeV, or 660 keV.\n\nThis means that the ⁷Be neutrinos, despite their immense flux, **do not produce any scattered electrons in the 700-800 keV or 800-900 keV energy bands.** Their contribution to the observable flux (event rate) in these bands is zero.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Fluxes in the Bands\n\nWith this insight, we can re-evaluate the sources contributing to the event flux in the two bands of *recoil electron energy*:\n\n1.  **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos: The source is turned off as per the problem statement.\n    *   ⁷Be neutrinos: Cannot produce electrons in this energy range.\n    *   **Therefore, the only source is the CNO cycle neutrinos** (¹³N and ¹⁵O), which have high enough energy to produce recoil electrons in this band.\n\n2.  **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos: The source is turned off.\n    *   ⁷Be neutrinos: Cannot produce electrons in this energy range.\n    *   **Therefore, the only source is also the CNO cycle neutrinos.**\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nThe problem now reduces to comparing the flux of events from CNO neutrinos in two adjacent 100 keV-wide energy bins. The CNO neutrino energy spectrum is continuous and smoothly decreasing in this region. This means the number of neutrinos available to create recoil electrons in the 700-800 keV range is slightly higher than the number available for the 800-900 keV range.\n\nConsequently, the rate of scattered electrons in Band 1 will be slightly higher than the rate in Band 2. The ratio of the fluxes (Flux in Band 1 / Flux in Band 2) will therefore be slightly greater than 1.\n\nGiven the choices, the value closest to this conclusion is 1.\n\n*   A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   B) 10\n*   C) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   D) 1\n\nThe flux from the CNO spectrum does not change dramatically over this small 200 keV interval, making the flux in both bands approximately equal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
