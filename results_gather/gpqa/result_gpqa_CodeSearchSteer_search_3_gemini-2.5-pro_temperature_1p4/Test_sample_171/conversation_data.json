    "The search results confirm the process.\n\n*   **Boltzmann Constant (k):** Its value is defined as exactly 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. This is numerically identical to the energy difference (ΔE) given in the problem (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J), which means the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n*   **Boltzmann Equation and Stellar Atmospheres:** The search results confirm that for stellar atmospheres assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool to relate the population of atoms in different energy states to the temperature. Specifically, the equation Nb/Na = (gb/ga) \\* exp(-(Eb-Ea)/kT) is used to find the ratio of atoms in two different energy levels.\n\nThe derivation stands:\n1.  **Start with the Boltzmann Equation** for the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the ground state (N_ground) for each star:\n    *   Star 1: (N_exc / N_gnd)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   Star 2: (N_exc / N_gnd)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   (Where C is the ratio of statistical weights, which is the same for both stars).\n\n2.  **Use the given information** that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n    *   (N_exc / N_gnd)_1 = 2 * (N_exc / N_gnd)_2\n\n3.  **Substitute and simplify**:\n    *   C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Take the natural logarithm of both sides**:\n    *   -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n5.  **Rearrange the equation** to solve for ln(2):\n    *   ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n6.  **Combine the terms in the parenthesis**:\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n7.  **Use the provided values**. The problem states ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant k is ~1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1.\n    *   ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    *   ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option C perfectly.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning. Everything appears sound. The key assumptions are LTE, the interpretation of \"twice as excited\", and the crucial numerical equivalence of ΔE and k. The question seems designed to test the application of the Boltzmann equation and this specific numerical simplification.\n\nThe derivation is solid. I can now provide the final answer.\nThe correct equation is derived from the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: For a given element, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy level *j* (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level *i* (N_i) is given by:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    where:\n    *   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels (ΔE).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the two stars**: We are comparing the same energy levels of iron in both stars, so the term (g_j / g_i) is a constant for both. Let's represent the ratio of populations (N_j / N_i) for each star as R_1 and R_2.\n\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the given observation**: We are told that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means the population ratio in star 1 is double that in star 2:\n\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n4.  **Substituting and solving**:\n\n    C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The constant C cancels out:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Rearrange to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n5.  **Using the given numerical values**: The problem states the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a value of approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n\n    Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
