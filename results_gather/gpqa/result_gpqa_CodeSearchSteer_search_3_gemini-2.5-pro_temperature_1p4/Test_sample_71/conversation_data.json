    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe name `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is likely a misnomer for a common precursor to *o*-quinodimethane, such as 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene. The reaction conditions involving sodium iodide are characteristic for generating *o*-quinodimethane (a highly reactive diene). This diene then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which acts as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of *o*-quinodimethane adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This results in the formation of a large, symmetric polycyclic molecule (Product 1), which has a central 7-tert-butoxy substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard method for the acidic cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group at the C-7 position is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming the secondary alcohol (Product 2). The stable tert-butyl carbocation is formed as a byproduct.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2, a secondary alcohol, is treated with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃•py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild reaction that oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. Thus, the hydroxyl group at C-7 is converted into a carbonyl group (C=O), forming Product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. This temperature promotes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, which is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition. This thermal decomposition breaks down Product 3 into its original components (or derivatives thereof). The fragmentation yields two molecules of *o*-quinodimethane and one molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n\nThe bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one intermediate is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n\nThe question asks for the analysis of the final product, designated as 4. In the context of such problems, \"product 4\" typically refers to the more structurally complex organic product, which in this case is *o*-quinodimethane (also known as 1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-3,5-diene).\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\nThe structure of *o*-quinodimethane is a six-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring and two exocyclic double bonds at adjacent positions. Assuming the molecule is planar, it possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we can analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Ring Hydrogens:** There are four hydrogens on the six-membered ring. Due to the C₂ symmetry axis, the two hydrogens closer to the exocyclic double bonds (at C3 and C6) are equivalent to each other. The two hydrogens further away (at C4 and C5) are also equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct sets of ring hydrogens.\n*   **Methylene Hydrogens:** There are two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups. The C₂ symmetry axis makes the two methylene groups equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are in different chemical environments. One hydrogen is pointed \"inward\" towards the other methylene group, and one is pointed \"outward.\" These are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are therefore chemically distinct. This results in two sets of methylene hydrogens.\n\nIn total, there are four chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in *o*-quinodimethane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
