    "When solving parabolic partial differential equations like the heat equation, a common approach is the method of lines, which discretizes the spatial variables, converting the PDE into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solution to this system involves a matrix exponential function, which is often approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials), such as a Pad√© approximation.\n\nTo convert the sequential process of solving this system into a parallel one, the key step is to decompose the rational function using partial fractions. This technique rewrites the complex rational function as a sum of simpler terms. Each of these simpler terms corresponds to a linear algebraic system that can be solved independently and concurrently on a separate processor. This decomposition is what allows for the \"parallel splitting\" and is the essential factor in transforming the algorithm from sequential to parallel.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation is the crucial element.\n\n<<<B>>>"
