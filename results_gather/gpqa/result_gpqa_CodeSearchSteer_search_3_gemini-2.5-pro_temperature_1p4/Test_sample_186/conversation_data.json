    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to evaluate two main criteria for each star: its observability from the Paranal Observatory and whether it is bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\n\n### **1. ESPRESSO Limiting Magnitude**\n\nA star is considered detectable if an S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour (3600 seconds) exposure. The ESPRESSO instrument is coupled with one of the 8-meter Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescopes (1-UT mode). According to a technical paper on ESPRESSO's performance, in the 1-UT mode, an S/N of 10 is obtained with a total exposure of one hour (3 exposures of 20 minutes) on a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17.1. This provides a crucial benchmark for our analysis. Any star with an apparent magnitude brighter than (i.e., less than) 17.1 will be detectable.\n\n### **2. Observability from Paranal**\n\nParanal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the northern celestial hemisphere. A star's declination (celestial latitude) determines its visibility from a given observatory.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Each Star**\n\nWe will now assess each star based on its apparent magnitude and declination.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with a visual apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74. This is significantly brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Declination:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 42'. As a southern hemisphere star, it is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude of about 2.0. This is well within the brightness limit for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Declination:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89° 16'. Since Paranal is at a latitude of -24.6°, stars with declinations far north of the celestial equator are not visible. The theoretical visibility limit for an observer at latitude `L` is `90° - |L|` in the opposite hemisphere's declination. For Paranal, this means stars with a declination greater than `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°` will never rise above the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** With a declination of +89°, Polaris is not visible from Paranal Observatory and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Absolute V magnitude = 15, distance = 10 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) using the formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`.\n    This is brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Declination:** The star's declination is 0°, on the celestial equator. The celestial equator is observable from all latitudes on Earth, except the poles, and is well-placed for observation from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Absolute V magnitude = 15, distance = 200 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) = 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5`.\n    A magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Declination:** 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Absolute V magnitude = 15, distance = 5 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) = 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5`.\n    This magnitude is well within the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Declination:** 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Absolute V magnitude = 15, distance = 50 pc**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) = 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5`.\n    A magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Declination:** 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Star | Apparent Magnitude (V) | Declination | Observable from Paranal? | Bright Enough? | Detectable? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **a) Canopus** | -0.74 | -52° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **b) Polaris** | 2.0 | +89° | No | Yes | **No** |\n| **c) d=10pc** | 15.0 | 0° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **d) d=200pc**| 21.5 | 0° | Yes | No | **No** |\n| **e) d=5pc** | 13.5 | 0° | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |\n| **f) d=50pc** | 18.5 | 0° | Yes | No | **No** |\n\nCounting the detectable stars, we have Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This gives a total of three detectable stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
