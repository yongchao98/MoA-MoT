    "The searches have confirmed the physical laws I intended to use:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An object's motion towards or away from an observer shifts the wavelengths of its emitted light. The radial velocity can be calculated from this shift.\n\nThe core of the problem remains the interpretation of the phrase \"wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest.\"\n\n*   **Interpretation 1:** This refers to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength in the star's rest frame. In this case, since the wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same (T1 = T2). The velocity information is extraneous.\n*   **Interpretation 2:** This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength from Earth. In this case, the Doppler effect from Star 2's radial velocity must be accounted for.\n\nThe phrasing \"appeared brightest\" strongly suggests the observed property. Furthermore, the inclusion of the radial velocity data and a corresponding answer choice (C) makes it highly probable that this is the intended solution path. Problems in physics exams are often designed to test the application of multiple concepts, and Interpretation 2 does exactly that. Interpretation 1 ignores a key piece of information provided.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the more detailed calculation that incorporates the Doppler shift.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the ratio of luminosities:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the given radius information:**\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂) using Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.**\n    *   Wien's Law states that temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star 1, radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. This causes a Doppler redshift. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   Therefore, λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Combining these facts: λ_rest,₁ = λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio:**\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Calculate the value of v₂/c:**\n    v₂ = 700 km/s\n    c = 300,000 km/s\n    v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n6.  **Substitute all values back into the luminosity ratio equation:**\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00935\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\nThe information regarding the masses of the stars appears to be extraneous, as it is not needed for the calculation based on black body radiation laws.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the velocity information is crucial and leads to answer C.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the problem, the solution is derived by combining the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law, and the formula for the Doppler effect.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities (L) of the two stars is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁/R₂ = 1.5).\n*   The radial velocity of Star 1 is 0 km/s, and for Star 2 it is 700 km/s.\n*   The stars are black bodies and the wavelengths at which they *appear* brightest are identical.\n\nThe key is to determine the ratio of the true surface temperatures (T₁/T₂) of the stars. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs). Since these are the same for both stars (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we must account for the Doppler effect caused by Star 2's radial velocity.\n\n1.  **For Star 1 (v₁ = 0):** There is no Doppler shift, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁).\n2.  **For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s):** Its motion away from the observer causes a redshift. Its observed peak wavelength is related to its rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler shift formula: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c), where c is the speed of light (≈ 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00935...\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
