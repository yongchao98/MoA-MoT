    "When a chemist says their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" they are most likely referring to a problem with a purification technique called chromatography. The underlying issue is that the compounds they are trying to separate have very similar polarities.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation:\n*   **Chromatography:** In a synthetic chemistry lab, the most common method to purify compounds and check the progress of a reaction is chromatography (specifically Thin Layer Chromatography, or TLC, and column chromatography). This technique separates molecules based on their differing affinities for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent).\n*   **The Role of Polarity:** In normal-phase chromatography, the stationary phase is very polar. Polar compounds in the mixture are strongly attracted to the stationary phase and move slowly. Less polar compounds are more attracted to the mobile phase solvent and move more quickly.\n*   **\"On Top of Each Other\":** If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will be attracted to the stationary and mobile phases to a nearly identical degree. This means they will move at almost the same speed.\n    *   On a **TLC plate**, this results in spots that are not well separated and may appear as one large spot or two overlapping spots.\n    *   In **column chromatography**, a larger-scale purification, the compounds will exit, or \"elute,\" from the column at the same time, a problem known as co-elution. This makes it impossible to isolate one compound from the other.\n\nThe other options are less likely for the following reasons:\n*   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for a different separation technique called distillation, and a chemist would more likely say \"I can't distill them apart.\"\n*   **C) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are the basis of polarity and how chromatography works, the specific problem isn't just that they are interacting, but that the *strength* of their individual interactions with the stationary phase is too similar.\n*   **D) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property used to characterize certain types of pure compounds (chiral molecules) and has no bearing on separating different compounds from a mixture by chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist's statement is a common colloquialism for a failed or very difficult chromatographic separation due to similar polarities of the components in the mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
