    "To identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data from Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and match it to one of the potential structures.\n\n### Analysis of the Data\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). Its position is typical for an ester. The conjugation with the benzene ring slightly lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹) to the observed value.\n\n**2. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to three protons (a methyl group, -CH₃). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂ group. This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons in this chemical shift range strongly suggests the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadening is due to quàdrupole effects of the nitrogen atom and potential proton exchange.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for two protons, split into a quartet (q), is consistent with a -CH₂ group adjacent to a -CH₃ group. Its downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates it is bonded to an electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, each a doublet (d) and integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate group, not the ester's alcohol portion. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl at a much more upfield position (~2-2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure is an amide, not an ester. Its IR spectrum would show a carbonyl band at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm⁻¹). Also, the aromatic signals in the NMR would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum. It would also have a very distinct formyl proton signal (>8 ppm) in the NMR spectrum, which is not observed.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as benzocaine, perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data. It has a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. The predicted spectral data for this compound align precisely with the data provided. Published spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirm an IR absorption for the C=O group around 1685 cm⁻¹ and N-H stretches at 3424 and 3345 cm⁻¹. The ¹H NMR data also align, showing the ethyl group, the broad amine signal, and the two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data from both the IR and ¹H NMR spectra are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
