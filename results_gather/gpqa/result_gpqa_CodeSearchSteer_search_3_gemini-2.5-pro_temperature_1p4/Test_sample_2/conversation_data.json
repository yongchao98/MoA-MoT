    "To find the expectation value of the operator for the given state, we follow these steps.\n\n**1. Define the State and Operator**\n\nThe spin-half particle is in the state:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn vector notation, where |↑⟩ =ᵀ and |↓⟩ =ᵀ, the state is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe operator is:\nA = 10σz + 5σx\n\nwhere σz and σx are the Pauli matrices.\n\n**2. Pauli Matrices**\n\nThe Pauli matrices in the z-basis are:\n*   σz = [, [0, -1]]\n*   σx = [,]\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator A is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. Due to the linearity of the operator, this can be calculated as:\n⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\n\nWe will calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately.\n\n**Expectation Value of σz:**\nThe expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of measuring spin-up minus the probability of measuring spin-down.\n⟨σz⟩ = |c_up|² - |c_down|²\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**Expectation Value of σx:**\nThe expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.\nFirst, apply the σx operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = [,] * [[0.5], [√3/2]] = [[√3/2], [0.5]]\n\nNow, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[√3/2], [0.5]]\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\n**4. Combine the Results**\n\nNow substitute the individual expectation values back into the equation for ⟨A⟩:\n⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨A⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2\n⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
