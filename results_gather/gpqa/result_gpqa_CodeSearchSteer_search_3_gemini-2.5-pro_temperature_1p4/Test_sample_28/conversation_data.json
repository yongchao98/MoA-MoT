    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, one must find the mutation that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by causing a complete loss of function of the protein encoded by the gene. An analysis of the different mutation types reveals the most probable candidate.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene involves reading the DNA sequence in groups of three, known as codons, with each codon specifying a particular amino acid or a signal to stop protein synthesis. The intact gene's initial sequence can be read as:\n\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG-TTT-CTC-GCT-GGT...-3’\n*   **Amino acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nBy comparing each mutant to this intact sequence, we can determine the type and severity of the mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT` is changed to `ATGTTCTACGCT`. When grouped into codons, this changes from `ATG-TTT-CTC` to `ATG-TTC-TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` is a **silent mutation** as both codons code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which results in the substitution of a single amino acid. This might alter or destroy protein function, but it is not guaranteed.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence changes from `ATG-TTT-CTC` to `ATG-TTC-TAA`.\n    *   The significant change is that the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has become `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein, especially since it occurs so early (at the third codon).\n*   **Mutant 3:** The mutant sequence is three base pairs longer than the intact sequence. This indicates an **in-frame insertion** of one codon (one amino acid). While this disrupts the protein, it does not change the reading frame for the rest of the gene. Its effect is often less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Mutant 4:** The mutant sequence is three base pairs shorter than the intact sequence. This indicates an **in-frame deletion** of one codon. This removes one amino acid but preserves the downstream reading frame. Like an in-frame insertion, this is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to other mutation types.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to eliminate the function of the target protein. It terminates protein synthesis, leading to a truncated and incomplete product. In this case, Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that no functional protein can be produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
