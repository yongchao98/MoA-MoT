    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the principles of planetary science, specifically the formulas for equilibrium temperature, radial velocity, and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n### Key Formulas:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to the square root of its star's radius and inversely proportional to the fourth root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, *a*). Given that the star's properties and the planets' albedos are the same, the ratio simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*). This can be expressed as a² ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Amplitude (K):** The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet is given by the Doppler shift in its spectral lines. The RV amplitude (*K*) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and orbital period (*P*). For a circular orbit, the relationship is:\n    K ∝ M_p / P^(1/3)\n    Rearranging for the period gives: P ∝ (M_p / K)³\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2):**\n    The radial velocity *K* is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    *   K1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2 / P1):**\n    Using the relationship P ∝ (M_p / K)³, we can find the ratio of the periods.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   P2 / P1 = (M_p2 / K2)³ / (M_p1 / K1)³ = (M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K1 / K2)³\n    *   P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³ * (3 / 4)³ = (15 / 28)³\n\n3.  **Determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):**\n    Using Kepler's Third Law relationship, a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3).\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (15 / 28)³ ]^(2/3) = (15 / 28)²\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    Finally, we use the equilibrium temperature ratio formula, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1).\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[ (15 / 28)² ] = 15 / 28\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
