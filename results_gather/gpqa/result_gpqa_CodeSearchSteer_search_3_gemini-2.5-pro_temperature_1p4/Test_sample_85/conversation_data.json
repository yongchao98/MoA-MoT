    "An analysis of the chemical reactions is necessary to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and its Precursor**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). Lactones of this type are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a corresponding hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the linear precursor acid:\n*   The ring name `pyran` indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   `-2-one` means there is a carbonyl group at the C2 position.\n*   `tetrahydro` means the ring is fully saturated.\n*   `4-ethyl` indicates an ethyl group at the C4 position.\n\nBy \"opening\" the lactone at the ester linkage, we find the precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`. The chiral center is at C3, the carbon atom bearing the ethyl group.\n\nA crucial point is that the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority of the substituents around the chiral center does not change during lactonization. Therefore, an (R)-precursor acid will form an (R)-lactone, and an (S)-precursor acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n*   Reaction A produces `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, so it must proceed through the `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate.\n*   Reaction B produces `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, so it must proceed through the `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting material in the options is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`). This starting material has two carboxyl-derived functional groups: one is a free carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), and the other is an isobutyl ester (`-COO-isobutyl`).\n\nTo obtain the necessary precursor `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`, one of these functional groups must be selectively reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`) while the other remains a carboxylic acid.\n\nNow, let's examine the selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. For this reaction to yield the correct precursor, the starting material must have the ester group at the position that becomes the alcohol (C5) and the acid group at the position that remains an acid (C1). Thus, the required starting material isomer is `(R)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl`. The LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, yielding the target `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters. For this reaction to yield the correct precursor, the starting material must have the carboxylic acid group at the position that becomes the alcohol (C5) and the ester group at the position that will be hydrolyzed to the acid (C1). This would require the starting material to be `(S)-isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. The BH₃ would reduce the C5-acid, and a subsequent acidic workup would hydrolyze the C1-ester, yielding the target `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Resolve the Discrepancy and Conclude**\n\nThere is a subtle issue: the two reactions, as they must proceed to give the correct products, require two different regioisomers of the starting material. However, the options provided assume that starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of the same constitutional isomer. This indicates a flaw in the question's design.\n\nDespite this flaw, we can determine the correct answer by focusing on the stereochemistry, which is consistently described. The reduction reactions do not affect the configuration of the pre-existing chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** Product is (R). Therefore, starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction B:** Product is (S). Therefore, starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThis logic leads directly to the conclusion that A is the (R)-enantiomer and B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) A = (R), B = (R)\nB) A = (R), B = (S)\nC) A = (S), B = (R)\nD) A = (S), B = (S)\n\nThe only option that matches our stereochemical analysis is B.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Starting material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Reacted with LiBH₄, this will produce the (R)-lactone (assuming the structure is the one required for this reaction to work).\n*   Starting material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Reacted with BH₃, this will produce the (S)-lactone (assuming the structure is the one required for this reaction to work).\n\nThe stereochemical assignment is consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
