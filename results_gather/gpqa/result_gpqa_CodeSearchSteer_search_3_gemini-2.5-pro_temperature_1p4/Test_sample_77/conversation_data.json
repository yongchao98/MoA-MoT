    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe correct formulas are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, c. This means the potential at an observation point **r** at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential **A** are given by:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by *c*:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThis can also be expressed using the relationship $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$, which shows that $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$.\n\nComparing these standard forms to the given choices, Option A is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature is the velocity-dependent term in the denominator, $(d c - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})$, which arises from the motion of the charge during the signal propagation time.\n\n<<<A>>>"
