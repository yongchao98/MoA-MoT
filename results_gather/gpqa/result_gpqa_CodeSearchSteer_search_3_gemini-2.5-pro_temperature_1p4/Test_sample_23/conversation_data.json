    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n`m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n`m ≈ 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n`m ≈ 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n`0.8572m ≈ 1.7136n`\n`m/n ≈ 2`\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nSaturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n- For alkanes, the H/C ratio is `(2n+2)/n = 2 + 2/n`, which approaches 2 as n becomes large.\n- For cycloalkanes, the H/C ratio is `2n/n = 2`.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which is 14.28%. This perfectly matches the data. So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. It is also the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds involved, under severe conditions. This suggests Z is a very stable cycloalkane. The most common and stable six-carbon cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\nLet's confirm the hydrogen percentage for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 14.37%, which is close. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n- Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n- One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let's call the other component Y₂. So, Y = (cyclohexane + Y₂).\n- Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenating Y₂ must also yield cyclohexane.\n- A key piece of information is that heating unsaturated six-membered rings with a platinum catalyst can cause a disproportionation reaction, yielding benzene and cyclohexane.\n- Let's test if Y could be a mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    - It's an equimolar mixture of two different liquids. (Fits)\n    - Does it decolorize bromine water? Neither benzene nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water under normal conditions. (Fits)\n    - Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y? Yes. (Fits)\n    - Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z? Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane results in no reaction. So, yes, the only final product is cyclohexane. (Fits)\nThis hypothesis is consistent with all the facts. So, **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n- The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n- Since this is a disproportionation between A and B, atom counts must be conserved. The total formula on the product side is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, A + B must also sum to C₁₂H₁₈.\n- Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both A and B must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-carbon ring structure. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ.\n- From atom conservation, we have x + y = 18.\n- Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds), so x < 12 and y < 12.\n- A final constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\nLet's find a pair of unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that fit these conditions. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n- Let A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀). Here, x = 10.\n- This would require B to be C₆H₈ (since 10 + 8 = 18). This corresponds to cyclohexadiene.\n- Let's check the conditions for this pair:\n    - **Unsaturation:** Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water. (Fits)\n    - **Non-conjugation:** Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation. Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, isolated double bonds). To fit the condition, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. (Fits)\n    - **Disproportionation:** The reaction C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene) is a balanced hydrogen transfer. Cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a classic disproportionation reaction. (Fits)\n\nSo, **mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n- Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n- Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
