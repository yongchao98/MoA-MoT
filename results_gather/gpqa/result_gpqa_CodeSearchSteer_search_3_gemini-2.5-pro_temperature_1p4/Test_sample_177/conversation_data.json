    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian `ℒ_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν`.\n\n### 1. Determining Mass Dimensions of Fields and the Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is a dimensionless quantity. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density `ℒ` over four-dimensional spacetime:\n\n*   `S = ∫ d⁴x ℒ`\n\nFrom this, we can deduce the mass dimensions of `d⁴x` and `ℒ`:\n*   Since spacetime coordinates `x` have a mass dimension of [x] = M⁻¹, the four-volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = M⁻⁴.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless ([S] = M⁰), the Lagrangian density `ℒ` must have a mass dimension of [ℒ] = M⁴.\n\nNext, we determine the mass dimensions of the individual fields from their respective kinetic terms in the standard free Lagrangian:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion is `ℒ_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`. For this term to have a dimension of M⁴, and knowing that the derivative `∂_μ` has a dimension of M¹, the term `ψ̄ψ` must have a dimension of M³. This gives the fermion field `ψ` a mass dimension of [ψ] = M³/².\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `ℒ_EM = -¼ F_μν F^μν`. For this to have a dimension of M⁴, the term `(F^μν)²` must have a dimension of M⁴, which means the field tensor itself has a mass dimension of [F^μν] = M².\n\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is composed of gamma matrices `γ_μ`, which are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, with [σ_μν] = M⁰.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction term `ℒ_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν` to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ`. The dimension of this interaction term must also be M⁴.\n\n[ℒ_int] = [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_μν] [ψ] [F^μν] = M⁴\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\n[κ] · (M³/²) · (M⁰) · (M³/²) · (M²) = M⁴\n[κ] · M³ · M² = M⁴\n[κ] · M⁵ = M⁴\n\nSolving for [κ]:\n\n[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹\n\n**Therefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1.**\n\n### 3. Assessing Renormalizability\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants, a method known as power counting. The criteria are as follows:\n\n*   **Dimensionless coupling ([g] = M⁰):** The theory is typically renormalizable (e.g., QED).\n*   **Positive mass dimension coupling ([g] > 0):** The theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   **Negative mass dimension coupling ([g] < 0):** The theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nA negative mass dimension indicates that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies. In perturbation theory, this leads to infinities in loop calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms, thus rendering the theory non-renormalizable.\n\nSince we found that [κ] = M⁻¹, the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.\n\n**Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   The mass dimension [κ]ₘ = -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
