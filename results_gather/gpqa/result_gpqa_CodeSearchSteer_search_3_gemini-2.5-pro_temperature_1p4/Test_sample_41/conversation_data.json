    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its orbital distance, and its orbital period. The information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this calculation, assuming the planets' masses are negligible compared to their star's mass.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is related to the distance from its star (the semi-major axis, 'a', for a circular orbit). The formula for equilibrium temperature shows that it is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, especially when the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nFrom this relationship, we can state that the semi-major axis is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\na ∝ 1 / (T_eq)²\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law and Orbital Period\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) when orbiting the same star.\n\nThis is written as:\nP² ∝ a³\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\n\nBy substituting the relationship for 'a' from the equilibrium temperature formula into Kepler's Third Law, we can find the direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature:\n\nP² ∝ (1 / (T_eq)²)³ = 1 / (T_eq)⁶\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\nP ∝ 1 / (T_eq)³\n\nThis means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 can be expressed as:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq₁ / T_eq₃, we multiply the two given ratios:\n(T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = T_eq₁ / T_eq₃\n1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nSo, T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ ≈ 3.22.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
