    "The logical flow and the formulas I used are correct.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). This is confirmed by multiple sources. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius.\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a blackbody heated only by its star. The energy balance equation shows that T_eq is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (T_eq ∝ 1/√a). All other factors, such as the star's properties and the planet's albedo, cancel out when taking a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo.\n\nThe derivation stands:\n\n1.  **Temperature vs. Distance:** T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n2.  **Distance vs. Period:** a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n3.  **Combined:** T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n4.  **Values:** The ratio of orbital periods (P1:P2:P3:P4:P5) is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   P_2 is proportional to 2.\n    *   P_4 is proportional to 3.5.\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.82986\n\nThe result is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the question to ensure no misinterpretation.\n- System of five exoplanets.\n- Circular orbits.\n- Orbital resonance (consistent with period ratios).\n- TTV discovery method (contextual).\n- Orbital period ratio: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n- Same albedo.\n- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nThe analysis is sound.\n\nFinal calculation: (4/7)^(1/3) = 0.82986... which rounds to 0.83.\nThis matches option B.\n\nI'm ready to provide the final answer.\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relationship:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (a) from the star, assuming other factors like stellar luminosity and albedo are constant. The formula is T_eq ∝ (1/a)¹ᐟ².\n\n2.  **Ratio of Temperatures:** For Planet_4 and Planet_2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₄)¹ᐟ²\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius. This relationship can be written as P² ∝ a³.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is related to the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    (a₂ / a₄) = (P₂ / P₄)²ᐟ³\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expression for the semi-major axis ratio into the temperature ratio equation, we get:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(P₂ / P₄)²ᐟ³]¹ᐟ²\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The period for Planet_2 (P₂) corresponds to the value 2.\n    *   The period for Planet_4 (P₄) corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\n    Now, we can plug these values into our derived formula:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹ᐟ³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.82986\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
