    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, often called the natural linewidth.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle states that a state with a shorter lifetime (Δt) will have a larger uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). To resolve two energy levels, their separation must be larger than their combined linewidths. More specifically, the energy difference should be significantly greater than the larger of the two individual energy widths.\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁ or Δt₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁): ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂ or Δt₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂): ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nState 1 has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy uncertainty (linewidth), which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly distinguish the two levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this dominant uncertainty.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the calculated uncertainty of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is also much smaller than the uncertainty.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This value is smaller than the energy width of the first state (~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is more than 100 times larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state, allowing for the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
