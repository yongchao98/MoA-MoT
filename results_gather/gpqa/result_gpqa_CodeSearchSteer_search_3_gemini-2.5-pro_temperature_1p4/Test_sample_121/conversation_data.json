    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    This reaction is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the typical Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr₃ as a catalyst, these conditions will also yield the α-brominated product.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    This is a classic cyclization reaction using a malonic ester derivative.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from ethyl cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbon atoms in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This is the first alkylation.\n    3.  Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n    4.  The resulting carbanion performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation or a rapid conformational change. Protons that are not chemically equivalent will produce distinct signals.\n\nThe final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is an achiral molecule. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the cyclohexane ring, as well as the cyano and ethyl carboxylate substituents.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-CH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (–CH₃) are equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (–CH₂–) are enantiotopic and are therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. This will produce a second, distinct **signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    The plane of symmetry makes the protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the corresponding protons on the other side. However, the two protons on any single methylene (CH₂) group within the ring are diastereotopic. This is because one is in an axial-like position and the other in an equatorial-like position relative to the rest of the molecule, and they cannot be interchanged by symmetry or rapid ring flipping. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals.\n\n    *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (non-equivalent), as are the two protons on C6. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial on C6. This results in **two distinct signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **C3 and C5 positions:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C5. This gives another **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C4 position:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two geminal protons on C4 are also diastereotopic because of the stereogenic-like environment created by the substituents at C1. They have different spatial relationships to the groups on C1 and are not interchangeable. This results in **two distinct signals**.\n\n**Summary of Signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -CH₂-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2-H / C6-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3-H / C5-H: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4-H: 2 signals\n\nTotaling these up: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
