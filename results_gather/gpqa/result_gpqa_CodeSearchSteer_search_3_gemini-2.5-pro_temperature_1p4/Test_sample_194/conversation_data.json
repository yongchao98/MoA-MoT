    "To determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation, we need to find the maximum possible semi-major axis it can have while still transiting its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation (passing behind the star) will also occur half an orbit later. Therefore, the primary condition to satisfy is the transit condition.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the Transit Condition:** A transit is typically defined by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the stellar radius. For the center of the planet to pass across the stellar disk, the impact parameter must be `b ≤ 1`. The limiting case for a transit to occur is `b = 1`.\n\n2.  **Use Information from Planet 1:** We are given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. The impact parameter is related to the planet's semi-major axis (`a1`) and its orbital inclination (`i`) by the formula:\n    `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    Where `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n    So, `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, which means they have the same orbital inclination `i`. This is the crucial link between the two planets.\n\n4.  **Establish the Condition for Planet 2:** For the second planet to transit, its impact parameter, `b2`, must be less than or equal to 1.\n    `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s ≤ 1`\n    Where `a2` is the semi-major axis of the second planet.\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can express `cos(i)` from Planet 1's data:\n    `cos(i) = (0.2 * R_s) / a1`\n    Now, substitute this into the expression for `b2`:\n    `b2 = (a2 / R_s) * [(0.2 * R_s) / a1] = 0.2 * (a2 / a1)`\n    The condition `b2 ≤ 1` becomes:\n    `0.2 * (a2 / a1) ≤ 1`\n    Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes gives:\n    `(a2 / a1) ≤ 1 / 0.2`\n    `(a2 / a1) ≤ 5`\n    This means the maximum semi-major axis for Planet 2 is 5 times that of Planet 1.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). This can be written as a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star:\n    `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n    Therefore:\n    `P2 / P1 = (a2 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Period:** Using the maximum ratio for the semi-major axes, we can find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2 (`P2_max`):\n    `P2_max / P1 = 5^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = P1 * 5^(3/2)`\n    Given that `P1 = 3` days:\n    `P2_max = 3 * 5 * √5`\n    `P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.1803`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe information regarding the radii of the star and the planets is not needed for this calculation, as the stellar radius `R_s` cancels out and the planetary radii are not part of the standard impact parameter calculation (`b ≤ 1`).\n\nThe maximum orbital period is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<B>>>"
