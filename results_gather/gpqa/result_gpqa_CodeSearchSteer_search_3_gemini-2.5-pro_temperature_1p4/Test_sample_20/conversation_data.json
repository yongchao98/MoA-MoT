    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the position of a proton, typically a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to occur.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone** (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In this specific case, the enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and particularly stable.\n\n*   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the second carbon a chiral center, and thus the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate** is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond and possesses a center of symmetry. Molecules with a center or plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
