    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes reveal the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, used to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect and absorb acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to water, a basic solution, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Verifying the Mass and Identifying the Salts**\n\nLet's check if the masses of the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) add up to the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\nThe products contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Therefore, the original salts A and B must be ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyacids. Given the products, suitable candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (at >250°C):** 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, so let's say it contains 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt, we get:\n*   **From n mol NH₄NO₂:** n mol N₂ + 2n mol H₂O\n*   **From n mol NH₄NO₃:** n mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + 2n mol H₂O\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   **Total N₂:** n + n = 2n\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   **Total O₂:** n/2\n\nNow, we can equate these with the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming that the mixture consists of 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite (Salt A) and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate (Salt B).\n\n### **3. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
