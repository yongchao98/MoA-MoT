    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes with distance (r), we must first understand the relationship between distance and parallax, and then apply the given information.\n\n### 1. The Relationship Between Distance and Parallax\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is the apparent shift of a nearby star against a background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax is inversely proportional. For small angles, this relationship is given by the simple formula:\n\n`r = 1 / plx`\n\nHere, if the parallax `plx` is measured in arcseconds, the distance `r` is in parsecs. This means that distance is inversely proportional to parallax (`r ∝ 1/plx`), and conversely, parallax is inversely proportional to distance (`plx ∝ 1/r`).\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Given Information\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This phrasing typically refers to the number of stars found per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as a differential `dN/d(plx)`.\n\nSo, we are given:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n### 3. Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Distance\nWe want to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is `dN/dr`. To convert the given relation from parallax to distance, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nWe have the two parts needed for this equation:\n1.  The given relation: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n2.  The derivative of parallax with respect to distance. Since `plx = 1/r`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(1/r) = -1/r^2`\n\nNow we can substitute these into the chain rule equation. We are interested in the proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute `plx = 1/r` into this proportionality:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
