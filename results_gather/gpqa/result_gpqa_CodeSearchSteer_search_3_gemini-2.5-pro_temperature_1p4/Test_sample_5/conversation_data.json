    "### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Energy Spectrum\n\nTo determine the energy spectrum for a particle in the given potential, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** The provided potential is in polar coordinates (r,θ). It's often easier to solve the Schrödinger equation if the potential can be separated into functions of independent Cartesian coordinates (x,y).\n2.  **Separate the Schrödinger Equation:** Once the potential is in Cartesian form, we will see if the time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable.\n3.  **Identify the Form of the Separated Equations:** We will analyze the resulting one-dimensional equations to identify the type of quantum system they represent.\n4.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** Using the standard solutions for these systems, we will find the energy eigenvalues for each dimension.\n5.  **Combine the Energies:** The total energy of the 2D system will be the sum of the energies from the independent one-dimensional systems.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given by:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nFrom these, we can see that `x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)`. Substituting these into the potential expression:\n\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)`\n\nNow, we combine the terms with `x^2` and `y^2`:\n\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n#### **2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:\n\n`[-ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V(x, y)] ψ(x, y) = E ψ(x, y)`\n\nSubstituting our potential, we get:\n\n`[-ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2] ψ(x, y) = E ψ(x, y)`\n\nThe potential `V(x,y)` is a sum of a function of `x` only and a function of `y` only (`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`). This means the Schrödinger equation is separable. We can assume a solution of the form `ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x) ψ_y(y)` and the total energy will be `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\nThis separates the 2D equation into two independent 1D equations:\n\n1.  For the x-direction: `[-ħ²/2m (d²/dx²) + 2kx^2] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)`\n2.  For the y-direction: `[-ħ²/2m (d²/dy²) + 1/2 ky^2] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)`\n\n#### **3. Identify the Form of the Separated Equations**\n\nBoth equations are in the form of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, which has the general potential `V(z) = 1/2 k_z z^2`.\n\n*   For the x-direction, `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. We can write this as `1/2 * (4k) * x^2`. So, the effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n*   For the y-direction, `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`. The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n\nThis system is known as a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n#### **4. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 k_z z^2` are given by the formula:\n\n`E_n_z = (n_z + 1/2)ħω_z`, where `ω_z = sqrt(k_z / m)`.\n\nLet's apply this to our two separated equations:\n\n*   **Energy for the x-direction (E_x):**\n    *   `k_x = 4k`\n    *   `ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)`\n    *   `E_n_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m)) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\n*   **Energy for the y-direction (E_y):**\n    *   `k_y = k`\n    *   `ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)`\n    *   `E_n_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\n#### **5. Combine the Energies**\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of `E_x` and `E_y`.\n\n`E = E_x + E_y = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nFactoring out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k / m)`:\n\n`E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
