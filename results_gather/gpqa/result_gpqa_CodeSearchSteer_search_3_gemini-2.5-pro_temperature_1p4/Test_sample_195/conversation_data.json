    "The problem asks for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. We can solve this by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n### 1. Setting up the Energy Conservation Equation\n\nThe total energy of the relativistic system is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and its potential energy. This total energy must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by:\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\nwhere:\n*   $m$ is the rest mass.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the oscillator at any point $x$ with velocity $v$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. However, the standard formulation for the conserved total energy in this system is $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$.\n\nAlternatively, a clearer way is to state that the total energy of the system is composed of rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy:\n$E_{total} = E_{rest} + E_{kinetic} + U_{potential}$\n\nLet's consider two key points in the oscillation:\n\n*   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v=0$. At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$, and the relativistic kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is at its maximum. The total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is zero ($U(0) = 0$). The mass is moving at its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$. At this point, the total energy is purely the relativistic energy of the mass:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2$\n\n### 2. Solving for the Maximum Speed\n\nAccording to the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n3.  Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
