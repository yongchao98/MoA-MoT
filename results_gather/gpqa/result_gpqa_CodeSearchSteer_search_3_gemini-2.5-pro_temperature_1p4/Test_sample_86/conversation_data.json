    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is benzene (C6).\n*   **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. This means the substituents on the benzene ring must contain two additional carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means a halogen (like Cl, Br) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Substitution:** The ring is di-substituted. One substituent is the halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Possible Structures:**\n    *   **Structure 1: Acetyl Group** The second substituent could be an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This gives the molecule haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Structure 2: Acetaldehyde Group** The second substituent could be a formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO). This gives the molecule halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This structure also fits the initial criteria.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the 1H NMR Data Options**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the correct 1H NMR spectrum from four choices. The key features of a 1H NMR spectrum are chemical shift (ppm), integration (number of protons, H), and multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.).\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 protons on the ring. The pattern of these signals reveals the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A para (1,4) substitution pattern typically gives two distinct doublets, as the protons on opposite sides of the ring are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Option A: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Signals:** This spectrum shows an aldehyde proton around 9.9 ppm, two doublets in the aromatic region, and a 2H singlet.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This data corresponds to **p-halophenylacetaldehyde**. The aromatic region `(7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d))` suggests para-substitution. The `9.9 (1H)` peak is characteristic for an aldehyde proton (-CHO), and the `3.7 (2H)` peak fits the methylene protons (-CH₂-). The multiplicities are listed as singlets, which can sometimes occur if coupling is not resolved, but this data matches the expected shifts for this structure.\n*   **Option B: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Signals:** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for **p-haloacetophenone**. The two doublets at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring. The singlet at `2.3 ppm` integrating to 3H is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetyl group (Ar-CO-CH₃). Published spectra for 4-bromoacetophenone show signals at δ 7.83 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), and 2.60 (s, 3H), which is an excellent match.\n*   **Option C & D:** These options lack signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, they cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth p-haloacetophenone (Option B) and p-halophenylacetaldehyde (Option A) are chemically plausible based on the initial description. However, the NMR data provided in Option B is a textbook-perfect match for p-haloacetophenone. The chemical shifts and, most importantly, the multiplicities align exactly with the expected pattern for this structure. The data in Option A has some questionable multiplicities (singlets instead of a triplet and doublet for the aldehyde and methylene protons, respectively), making it a less likely correct answer than B.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a para-substituted haloacetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is provided in Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
