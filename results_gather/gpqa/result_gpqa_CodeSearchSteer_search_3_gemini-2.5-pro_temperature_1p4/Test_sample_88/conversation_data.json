    "To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we must first deduce the structures of products 1, 2, and 3 through a step-by-step analysis of the given reaction sequence and spectroscopic data.\n\n### **Step 1: Elucidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration (2+10+2 = 14H) corresponds to the number of hydrogens in the adamantane cage, indicating no loss of protons. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   IR Spectroscopy: A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This value is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O) of a ketone, especially in a strained ring system.\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases at high temperatures is known to proceed through a skeletal rearrangement. Instead of a simple substitution or elimination (which is disfavored at the bridgehead position due to Bredt's rule), the adamantane cage rearranges to a protoadamantane structure. Specifically, this reaction yields protoadamantan-4-one.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one (also known as tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-5-one) is a known compound. The provided ¹H NMR data, particularly the highly deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm and the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, have been reported for a related compound, protoadamantan-4-one, sometimes referred to as nor-protoadamantene-ketone. Although the peak at 4.79 ppm is unusual for a simple ketone, it is characteristic of this specific rearranged cage structure. Therefore, Product 1 is identified as protoadamantan-4-one.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7123jO0.png\" alt=\"Reaction from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to protoadamantan-4-one\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n### **Step 2: Elucidation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols using an aluminum alkoxide catalyst, with isopropanol (formed from the isopropoxide) acting as the hydrogen source. The ketone group in protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The reduction of protoadamantan-4-one yields the corresponding alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G35L8sL.png\" alt=\"Reaction from protoadamantan-4-one to protoadamantan-4-ol\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n### **Step 3: Elucidation of Product 3 and ¹H NMR Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This two-step process is an ozonolysis reaction. However, protoadamantan-4-ol does not contain any carbon-carbon double bonds for ozone to cleave. In the absence of C=C bonds, ozone can react with activated C-H bonds, such as those at tertiary carbons. Tertiary C-H bonds are susceptible to insertion by ozone, leading to the formation of a hydrotrioxide intermediate, which upon workup is converted to a tertiary alcohol.\n*   **Site of Oxidation:** In protoadamantan-4-ol, the most activated C-H bonds are at the two tertiary bridgehead positions adjacent to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-3 and C-5). Let's consider the oxidation at the C-3 position. This would form protoadamantane-3,4-diol.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Ozonolysis of product 2 results in protoadamantane-3,4-diol.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/R3pXJ55.png\" alt=\"Reaction from protoadamantan-4-ol to protoadamantane-3,4-diol\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:** We need to determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH protons).\n    *   The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbons bearing the hydroxyl groups (C-3 and C-4) will be the most deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atoms. Let's call them H-3 and H-4.\n    *   **Coupling of H-4:** The proton at C-4 (H-4) is adjacent to:\n        *   C-3, which has one proton (H-3).\n        *   C-10, which is a CH₂ group with two non-equivalent protons.\n        *   The coupling between H-4 and H-3 will result in a doublet.\n        *   Each line of this doublet will be further split by the two protons on C-10. This will be a triplet.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H-4 is expected to be a **doublet of triplets**.\n    *   **Coupling of H-3:** The proton at C-3 (H-3) is adjacent to:\n        *   C-4, which has one proton (H-4).\n        *   C-2, which is a CH₂ group with two non-equivalent protons.\n        *   C-8, which is a tertiary CH group with one proton (H-8).\n        *   The coupling of H-3 with H-4, the two protons at C-2, and H-8 would result in a complex multiplet.\n*   **Conclusion:** Comparing the two most deshielded protons (H-3 and H-4), the signal for H-4 presents a more clearly defined coupling pattern. Given the options, the doublet of triplets is the most plausible and identifiable pattern for one of the most deshielded protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
