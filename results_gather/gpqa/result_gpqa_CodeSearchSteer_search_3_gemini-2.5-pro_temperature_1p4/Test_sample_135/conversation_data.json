    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\nThe vector field is given by:\n*   **Magnitude**: `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`\n*   **Direction**: Radially outward from the origin.\nIn spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of this field in spherical coordinates for `r > 0` gives:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n\nIf one were to naively integrate this zero divergence over the volume, the result would be 0. However, this is incorrect because the vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), where the field and its divergence are undefined.\n\nBecause of this singularity, the Divergence Theorem cannot be directly applied to the entire volume at once. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis theorem is central to physical laws like Gauss's law in electromagnetism. The singularity at the origin acts as a source.\n\nTo correctly solve the problem, we can use the Divergence Theorem on the surface of the sphere, which calculates the total flux emerging from the source at the origin.\n\n1.  **Vector field on the surface**: On the surface of the sphere of radius `R`, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n2.  **Surface element**: The differential surface element `dS` on a sphere is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂`, with the vector `r̂` pointing outward.\n3.  **Dot product**: The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is `[(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂]`. Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to `sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n4.  **Surface Integral**: We integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are 0 to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are 0 to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    *   The integral of `sin(θ)` from 0 to `π` is `[-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The integral of `dφ` from 0 to `2π` is `[φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`.\n\n    The result of the integration is `2 * 2π = 4π`.\n\nThis result shows that despite the divergence being zero almost everywhere, the singularity at the origin creates a net flux of `4π`. The volume integral of the divergence over the entire sphere is equal to this total flux. The divergence at the origin can be formally described by the Dirac delta function, where `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. The integral of this over a volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
