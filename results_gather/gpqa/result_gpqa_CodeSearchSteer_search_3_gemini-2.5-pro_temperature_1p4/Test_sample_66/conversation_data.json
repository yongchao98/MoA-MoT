    "When considering the addition of angular momenta in quantum mechanics, a fundamental rule is the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum. The coupled state of a two-electron system is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons, respectively. The total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\nThe measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, must correspond to eigenvalues of $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$. For the specific outcome where both eigenvalues are $-\\hbar$, the quantum numbers would be $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n\nA key principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the relation $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nIn this problem, the system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$. The question asks for the probability of a measurement outcome where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. For this outcome, the sum would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the required sum of the individual components ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$) does not equal the z-component of the total angular momentum of the system ($m = -1$), this outcome is not possible. The probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum is zero.\n\nThis can be more formally understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the probability amplitude of finding the system in a specific uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ when it is in a coupled state $|l, m>$. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, denoted as $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$, is non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. In this case, since $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Consequently, the probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
