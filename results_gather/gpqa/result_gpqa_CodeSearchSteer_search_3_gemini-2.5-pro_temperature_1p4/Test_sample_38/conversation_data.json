    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be equal to 1. Since we are told the particle is only ever found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must be 1.\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density function is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². To calculate this, we multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x) = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) - (0.25 * -1)\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNow, we set up the normalization integral:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x ] from 1 to 3 = 1\n\nNext, we evaluate the expression at the limits of integration:\n[ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ] = 1\n[ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ] = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), we simplify the equation:\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nFinally, we calculate the value of 'a'. The natural logarithm of 2, ln(2), is approximately 0.6931.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
