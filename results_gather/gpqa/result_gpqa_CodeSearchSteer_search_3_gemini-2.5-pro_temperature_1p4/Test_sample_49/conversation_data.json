    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we must analyze the structure of the provided mathematical expression. The key lies in understanding how different components of a loop calculation are represented.\n\nThe expression is: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n\nLet's break down the components:\n*   **Coupling Constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`)**: The term `alpha` represents the fine-structure constant, and `g` is another coupling constant. Their powers indicate the number and type of vertices in the diagram.\n*   **Numerical and Kinematic Factors (`sqrt(2) * 8 * (Q/M)^2`)**: These include numerical coefficients (`sqrt(2)`, `8`) that arise from symmetry factors and summing over spin states, and a kinematic factor `(Q/M)^2` which is a ratio of energy scales. These do not directly reveal the number of loops.\n*   **The Loop Factor (`1/(4pi)^6`)**: This is the most crucial part for determining the loop number. In quantum field theory, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integration over an internal particle's momentum introduces a standard factor of `1/(4pi)^2`.\n\nGiven the term `1/(4pi)^6` in the expression, we can rewrite it as `(1/(4pi)^2)^3`. Comparing this to the standard result where an L-loop diagram contributes a factor of `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`, we can directly infer the number of loops, L.\n\nIn this case, since the expression contains `(1/(4pi)^2)^3`, it signifies that three loop integrations were performed. Therefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
