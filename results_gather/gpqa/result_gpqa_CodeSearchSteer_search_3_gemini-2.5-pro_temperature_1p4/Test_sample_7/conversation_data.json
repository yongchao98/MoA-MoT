  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Single Mutants\nFirst, we assess the impact of each individual gene by looking at the single knock-out mutants compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance):\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This indicates that gene G1 contributes to the resistance, and its loss reduces the resistance level by 25%.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. Gene G3 has a more significant role than G1, as its absence causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of gene G2 completely eliminates anthracnose resistance. This suggests that G2 is an essential component of the resistance pathway.\n\n### Analysis of the Double Mutants and Gene Interactions\n\nNext, we analyze the double mutants to understand how the genes interact, specifically looking for epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the epistatic gene's mutant.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both of these double mutants show 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant. In both cases, the complete loss of resistance caused by the `g2` mutation masks the partial loss of resistance seen in the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) mutants. This is a classic case of epistasis, where **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**.\n*   **Role of G2:** The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Since G2 is epistatic to the other two genes, it is the most likely candidate for this upstream transcription factor. A transcription factor that activates G1 and G3 would be essential for the pathway; if it's knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to a total loss of resistance, regardless of whether G1 and G3 are functional.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** This double mutant has 10% resistance.\n    *   This is not a case of simple epistasis between G1 and G3. If G1 (75% resistance) were epistatic to G3, the double mutant would have 75% resistance. If G3 (50% resistance) were epistatic, the double mutant would have 50% resistance. Neither is the case.\n    *   Instead, we observe a synergistic interaction. The combined loss of resistance (90% loss) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75% loss). This phenomenon often points to **gene redundancy**. It suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping functions. The system can partially cope with the loss of one, but losing both has a much more severe, synergistic effect.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data on one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The double mutant phenotype (10%) does not match the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. The synergistic effect in the g1g3 mutant is a hallmark of at least partial gene redundancy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect, as established above. However, among the choices, this option contains two strongly supported conclusions. The error is likely in this third clause.\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The epistatic relationships clearly point to G2 as the most likely upstream regulator.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular mechanism that cannot be concluded from phenotypic data alone.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The double mutant phenotype (10%) does not match the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOption B provides the most accurate description of the genetic interactions, despite having one incorrect statement. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor based on epistasis data and correctly interprets the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The other options contain more incorrect or unverifiable statements.\n\n<<<B>>>"
