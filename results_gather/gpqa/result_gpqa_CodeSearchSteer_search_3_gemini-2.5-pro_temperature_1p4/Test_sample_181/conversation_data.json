    "The Mott-Gurney equation is derived based on a set of ideal conditions. Analyzing the options:\n\n*   **A) Single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current:** A Schottky contact creates a barrier to charge injection, which would limit the current. The Mott-Gurney law, however, assumes the contact can supply an unlimited number of carriers, meaning it is Ohmic, not Schottky.\n*   **B) Two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current:** The basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for a unipolar, or single-carrier, device where either electrons or holes are the dominant charge carriers.\n*   **C) Trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current:** The SCLC regime is fundamentally a drift-dominated phenomenon. Stating that the drift current is negligible is incorrect; it is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n*   **D) Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current:** This statement accurately captures the primary assumptions. The device must be for a single carrier type (unipolar). The contacts must be Ohmic, meaning there is no barrier to injecting charge. The material is assumed to be an ideal insulator without any trap states that would capture the injected carriers. Finally, the model assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the applied field, making the diffusion component negligible.\n\nTherefore, the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free, single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) where the current is drift-dominated (negligible diffusion current).\n\n<<<D>>>"
