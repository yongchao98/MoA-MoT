    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the starspots and then equate it to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\nHere are the given parameters:\n*   Star's effective temperature (Teff_star): 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature (Teff_spot): 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor on one hemisphere (f): 20% = 0.20\n\n**Step 1: Determine the flux from the star at maximum and minimum brightness.**\n\nWe can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (F) of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the relative change, so we can ignore the constants.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature.\n    F_max ∝ Teff_star⁴ = 6000⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer. On this side, 20% of the area is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% has the star's normal temperature.\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff_star⁴ + f * Teff_spot⁴\n    F_min ∝ (1 - 0.20) * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\n    F_min ∝ 0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation.**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal in the light curve is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nAmplitude = (Teff_star⁴ - [ (1 - f) * Teff_star⁴ + f * Teff_spot⁴ ]) / Teff_star⁴\nAmplitude = (Teff_star⁴ - Teff_star⁴ + f * Teff_star⁴ - f * Teff_spot⁴) / Teff_star⁴\nAmplitude = f * (Teff_star⁴ - Teff_spot⁴) / Teff_star⁴\nAmplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)⁴)\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**Step 3: Relate the spot-induced amplitude to a planetary transit.**\n\nThe signal produced by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal, the transit depth must be equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the relative radius of the exoplanet.**\n\nWe take the square root of the amplitude to find the ratio of the radii.\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated relative radius matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
