    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of objects whose Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff for optical observations from the ground.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** The Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a wavelength of approximately 1216 Å (or 121.6 nm). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation. For a ground-based telescope to detect a signal, the light must have a wavelength long enough to pass through what is known as the \"optical window.\" This window begins at the edge of the ultraviolet, at a wavelength of approximately 300-330 nm (3000-3300 Å). Below this, atmospheric absorption, primarily by ozone, is too strong. Therefore, the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted to at least this wavelength to be detectable.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength (λ_rest) of the emitted light to the observed wavelength (λ_obs) by the formula:\n    1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n    Therefore, z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we must use the shortest possible observed wavelength (λ_obs), which is the atmospheric cutoff. Taking a practical cutoff value of around 3500 Å, which is well within the capabilities of ground-based instruments, we can calculate the minimum redshift:\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 1.9. A redshift of 1.9 would shift the 1216 Å line to an observed wavelength of 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å. This wavelength is in the near-ultraviolet range and can penetrate the atmosphere to be observed by ground-based telescopes. While observations are possible at slightly shorter wavelengths (and thus slightly lower redshifts), a value of z ≈ 1.9 is a standard and practical lower limit for large surveys of these objects from the ground. In fact, some studies specifically mention that ground-based observations of neutral hydrogen are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
