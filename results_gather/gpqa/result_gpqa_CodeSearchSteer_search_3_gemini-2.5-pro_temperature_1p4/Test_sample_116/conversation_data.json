    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, but it can also arise from an axis of chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to the biphenyl class of compounds. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by the presence of large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This hindered rotation locks the molecule in a non-planar conformation, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. This compound exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, passing through the carbonyl group. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Although it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
