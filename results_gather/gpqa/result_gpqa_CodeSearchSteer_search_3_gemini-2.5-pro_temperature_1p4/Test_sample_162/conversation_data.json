    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part 1: Minimum Volume of Acid\n\n1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation:** The reaction between solid iron(III) hydroxide and a strong monobasic acid (represented as H⁺) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol. This is often rounded to 106.87 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n4.  **Determine the moles of acid required:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n5.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid:**\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity\n    *   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option D.\n\n### Part 2: pH of the Resulting Solution\n\n1.  **Determine the final concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   After dissolving, the moles of Fe³⁺ are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃ (0.0009357 mol).\n    *   The total volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.\n    *   Concentration [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume (L) = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\n2.  **Consider the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion:**\n    *   The iron(III) ion in water exists as the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺. This ion acts as a weak acid, donating a proton to water.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is:\n        [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant, Ka.\n\n3.  **Find the value of Ka for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺:**\n    *   According to a Ka table, the value for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ is 6.0 x 10⁻³.\n\n4.  **Calculate the equilibrium concentration of H₃O⁺:**\n    *   We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of H₃O⁺, which we'll call 'x'.\n        *   **Reaction:** [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺ + H₃O⁺\n        *   **Initial:** 0.009357 M | 0 | 0\n        *   **Change:** -x | +x | +x\n        *   **Equilibrium:** (0.009357 - x) | x | x\n    *   Ka = [Products] / [Reactants] = (x * x) / (0.009357 - x)\n    *   6.0 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    *   To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula (ax² + bx + c = 0) after rearranging the equation:\n        x² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - (5.6142 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n    *   Solving the quadratic equation gives a positive root for x:\n        x ≈ 0.00489 M\n        So, [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.00489 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   pH = -log[H₃O⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.00489) ≈ 2.31\n\nThe calculated pH of ~2.31 is closest to the value of 2.04 in option D. The discrepancy might arise from using slightly different values for molar masses or Ka in the problem's source, or due to ionic strength effects not considered in this calculation. However, the combination of the calculated volume (28.07 cm³) and the pH (~2.31) points strongly towards option D as the intended answer, as it is significantly closer than any other option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
