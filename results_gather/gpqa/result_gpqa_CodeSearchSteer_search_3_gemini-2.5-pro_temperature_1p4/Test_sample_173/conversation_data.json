    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, respectively.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies (m₁c² and m₂c²):\n1.  m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)\n2.  (m₁ + m₂)c² = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2 * (m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV\nm₂c² = 99 GeV\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁):\nm₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are **m₁c² = 198 GeV** and **m₂c² = 99 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This is due to the conservation of total energy.\nQ = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nSo, **T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV**.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m, where p is the momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is conserved and must be zero. Therefore, the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\np₁ = p₂ = p\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n*   T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)\n*   T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\nT₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2\nSo, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using the correct (relativistic) formula\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and rest-mass is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². The kinetic energy is T = E - mc², so E = T + mc².\nSubstituting E, we get: (T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n(pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\nT₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n2.  T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV  =>  T₂ = 3 - T₁\n\nSubstitute T₂, m₁c² = 198 GeV, and m₂c² = 99 GeV into the first equation:\nT₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603\n\nNow, solve for T₁:\n396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603\n600T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classically calculated T₁ is:\nΔT₁ = T₁ - T₁_classical\nΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\nΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
