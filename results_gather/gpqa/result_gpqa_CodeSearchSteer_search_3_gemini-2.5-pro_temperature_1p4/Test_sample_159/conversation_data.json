    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach the shape of a circle as N becomes infinitely large. In this limit, the apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima in the Airy pattern is given by:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (x * λ) / (2 * π * a)\nwhere 'x' represents the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function, λ is the wavelength of the light, and 'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\nThe first two zeros of the first-order Bessel function (J₁) are approximately:\n*   First zero (for the first minimum, θ₁): x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second zero (for the second minimum, θ₂): x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n**First Minimum (θ₁):**\nUsing the small angle approximation:\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nThis is often rounded to θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a.\n\n**Second Minimum (θ₂):**\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\nThis is often rounded to θ₂ ≈ 1.117 λ / a or given in terms of the aperture diameter D=2a as 2.23 λ / D.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum)\nB) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculated value)\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a (This corresponds to the angular *radius* of the Airy disk when 'a' is taken as the diameter, or the diameter of the Airy disk when 'a' is the radius)\n\nThus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
