    "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass of each binary system and then find their ratio.\n\nThe mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). For eclipsing binaries, the inclination of the orbit is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the calculations. The total mass (M) of the system is given by the formula:\n\nM = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle (i) is 90°, making sin(i) = 1. The term 2πG is a constant that will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two masses. Therefore, the mass of each system is directly proportional to P * (K₁ + K₂)³.\n\n### **System 1 Calculation**\n*   **Orbital Period (P₁):** 2 years\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁, K₂):** 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   **Sum of Amplitudes:** 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nThe mass of system 1 (M₁) is proportional to:\nM₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n### **System 2 Calculation**\n*   **Orbital Period (P₂):** 1 year\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁, K₂):** 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   **Sum of Amplitudes:** 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe mass of system 2 (M₂) is proportional to:\nM₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n### **Mass Ratio**\nTo find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M₁ / M₂:\n\nRatio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
