    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nPropionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH2CH2SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF3). This is a standard reaction to protect the aldehyde functional group as a cyclic thioacetal, also known as a 1,3-dithiane. The product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nProduct A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) is treated with n-butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic and is removed by BuLi. This process, known as umpolung or polarity reversal, converts the originally electrophilic carbonyl carbon into a nucleophilic carbanion. The product B is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe nucleophilic carbanion B reacts with bromoethane (CH3CH2Br) in an SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position of the dithiane ring. The resulting product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**\nThis step is the deprotection of the dithioacetal. Treatment of C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) with mercuric chloride (HgCl2) in aqueous acid hydrolyzes the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group. The product D is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH3CH2)2C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction.\n*   **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) first reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH3CH2)2CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt. This salt is then deprotonated with BuLi to form the phosphorus ylide, (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.\n*   **Wittig reaction:** The ketone D (3-pentanone) reacts with the newly formed ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh3 group of the ylide are exchanged, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The final product E is (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2, which is named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\nThe structure of the final product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene (also known as tetraethylethylene), is highly symmetrical.\n\n      CH2CH3\n      |\nCH3CH2-C=C-CH2CH3\n      |\n      CH2CH3\n\nDue to the symmetry of the molecule:\n1.  The two carbons of the central C=C double bond are in identical chemical environments.\n2.  All four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are equivalent.\n\nBecause all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent, their corresponding carbons will produce the same signals. An ethyl group has two distinct carbon environments: a methylene (-CH2-) carbon and a methyl (-CH3) carbon.\n\nTherefore, we can identify three unique sets of carbon atoms in the molecule:\n*   The two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C).\n*   The four equivalent methylene carbons (-CH2-).\n*   The four equivalent methyl carbons (-CH3-).\n\nEach unique set of carbon atoms will produce a single signal in the 13C-NMR spectrum. Consequently, the final product E will show a total of **3** signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
