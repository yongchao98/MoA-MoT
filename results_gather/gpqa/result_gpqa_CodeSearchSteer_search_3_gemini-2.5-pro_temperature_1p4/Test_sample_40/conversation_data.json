    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept in Einstein's theory of special relativity. This scenario is famously demonstrated in the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the reference frames:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary reference frame, which we can call *S*. The observer is at rest in this frame.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the second reference frame, *S'*. This frame moves with a constant velocity *v* relative to the lab frame *S*.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities in each frame:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (*S'*) relative to the lab frame (*S*) is *v*.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured within the glass's own rest frame (*S'*), is determined by its index of refraction, *n*. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is *u' = c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum *c* as 1, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   The goal is to find the speed of the light beam in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (*S*). Let's call this speed *u*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding two velocities, *v* and *u'*, that are in the same direction is:\n\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)*\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute *u' = 1/n*, *v = v*, and *c = 1* into the equation:\n\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the expression, multiply the numerator and the denominator by *n*:\n\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis final expression matches option D. This result was confirmed by Max von Laue in 1907 as a natural consequence of the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\n<<<D>>>"
