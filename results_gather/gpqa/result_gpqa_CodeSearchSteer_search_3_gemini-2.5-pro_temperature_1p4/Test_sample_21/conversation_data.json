    "To determine the correct combination of words, we need to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different pH conditions.\n\n### 1. Thermodynamic Aspect\nThe first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher, more positive reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solutions to that in acidic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution**, the half-reaction and its standard potential are:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)     E° = +1.23 V.\n*   **In basic solution**, the half-reaction and its standard potential are:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)     E° = +0.40 V.\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution (+0.40 V) is lower than in an acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### 2. Kinetic Aspect\nThe second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nKinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to have slow kinetics, often requiring a catalyst (like platinum) and a significant overpotential (extra voltage) to proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\n*   Studies comparing the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic and alkaline (basic) media have found that the reaction kinetics are generally slower in acidic solutions.\n*   For instance, one study on a rhodium electrode found that the ORR activity (a measure of the reaction rate) was higher in a basic NaOH solution than in acidic HClO₄ or H₂SO₄ solutions.\n*   The reaction in acidic media involves high activation barriers for the multi-electron transfer process, which leads to a large potential loss and slow reaction rates.\n\nTherefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. This confirms the second part of the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the two findings:\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThe correct combination is **weaker – slower**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
