    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as having the chemical formula C6H10O2. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence:\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically around 1710-1760 cm⁻¹ for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The combination of a C=O and a C=C in conjugation can lower the absorption frequency of the carbonyl group.\n    *   The collective FTIR data strongly suggests the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Vinyl protons typically appear in the 4.6-5.9 ppm range of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a significant clue. This fragment is characteristic of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺) and is a common fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. The loss of this group from the molecular ion is a prominent fragmentation pathway.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nTo determine the correct formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each option. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The spectroscopic data points to a molecule with at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This fits the required unsaturation, but the presence of only one oxygen atom is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid functional group, which requires two.\n*   **B) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula does not have enough degrees of unsaturation to account for both a carbonyl and a double bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, allowing for a carboxylic acid group, and has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both the carbonyl (C=O) and the vinyl (C=C) groups identified in the spectra. This option is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or ester). The presence of vinyl hydrogens and a C=C peak in the FTIR spectrum rules out a fully saturated structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The chemical formula **C6H10O2** is the only option that accommodates all the observed functional groups (carboxylic acid and alkene) and matches the required degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
