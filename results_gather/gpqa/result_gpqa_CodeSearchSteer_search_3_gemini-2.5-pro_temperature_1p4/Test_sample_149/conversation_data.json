    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is determined from its ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation based on the formula ((2C + 2 + N - H)/2) reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its splitting into a triplet indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH₂- group that is adjacent to the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n\nCombining these pieces, the starting compound is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material undergoes a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for diazotization. It converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). In this step, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt.\n2.  **H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it leads to a hydrolysis reaction where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This step forms **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. An aldehyde with α-hydrogens, like 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, will react with itself in the presence of a strong base like KOH.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde called an aldol addition product. In this case, the addition product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is especially favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The dehydration of the aldol adduct leads to the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, yields the final product. The elimination of water from the aldol adduct forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n\nThe structure of the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
