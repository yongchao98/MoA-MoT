    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, the method of images is a common approach in electrostatics.\n\n### Method of Images\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The sphere is grounded, meaning its electric potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **The Image Charge:** The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere along the same line as the original charge `q`. This replacement is valid as long as it correctly reproduces the boundary condition, which is that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge `q'` is given by `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The location of the image charge, `b`, from the center of the sphere is `b = R^2/d`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d`. An important concept in this calculation is that the potential energy of the interaction between the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential created by the induced charges at the location of `q`. The potential created by the induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   First, calculate the potential (`V_image`) at the position of the charge `q` (a distance `d` from the center) that is created by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    *   The potential due to the image charge `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half of the product of the charge `q` and this potential. The factor of 1/2 is included because the potential `V_image` is established by the presence of `q` itself; not including this factor would be equivalent to double-counting the energy.\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   C) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    *   D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
