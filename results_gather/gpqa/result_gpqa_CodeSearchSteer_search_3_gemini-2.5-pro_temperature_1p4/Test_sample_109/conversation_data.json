    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Observatory and Instrument Criteria**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory:**\n    *   Location: Paranal Observatory, Chile. Latitude ~ -24.6 degrees.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES at W. M. Keck Observatory:**\n    *   Location: Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA. Latitude ~ +19.8 degrees.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n\nA star is considered observable from a specific latitude (φ) if its declination (δ) is greater than φ - 90°. We are instructed to disregard other pointing limits.\n*   **Keck Visibility:** Declination must be > (19.8° - 90°) = -70.2°.\n*   **Paranal Visibility:** Declination must be > (-24.6° - 90°) = -114.6°.\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 15 deg, DEC = -75 deg\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of -75° is not greater than the -70.2° limit for Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star1 cannot be observed by the Keck Observatory and is therefore not detectable by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 30 deg, DEC = 55 deg\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 16.5 mag.\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   This magnitude is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17.\n    *   However, it is *not* brighter than HIRES's limit of 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star2 cannot be observed by HIRES and is therefore not detectable by both.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 11 h, DEC = 48 deg\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of +48° is visible from both Keck (+48° > -70.2°) and Paranal (+48° > -114.6°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 15.5 mag. The term \"apparent magnitude\" refers to the brightness as observed from Earth, which already accounts for any interstellar dust extinction.\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   V = 15.5 is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17.\n    *   V = 15.5 is brighter than HIRES's limit of 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star3 is visible from and bright enough for both observatories.\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 85 deg, DEC = -48 deg\n*   **Properties:** Absolute V magnitude (M\\_V) = 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, distance = 10 pc.\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of -48° is visible from both Keck (-48° > -70.2°) and Paranal (-48° > -114.6°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (V) using the distance modulus formula, including extinction (A\\_V).\n    *   A\\_V = 3.1 \\* E(B-V) = 3.1 \\* 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   V = M\\_V + 5\\*log10(d/10pc) + A\\_V\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5\\*log10(10/10) + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5\\*log10(1) + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   V = 16.74 is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17.\n    *   However, it is *not* brighter than HIRES's limit of 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star4 is too faint to be observed by HIRES and is therefore not detectable by both.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 10 h, DEC = 60 deg\n*   **Properties:** Absolute V magnitude (M\\_V) = 16.5 mag, distance = 5 pc. No extinction is mentioned, so we assume A\\_V = 0.\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of +60° is visible from both Keck (+60° > -70.2°) and Paranal (+60° > -114.6°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   V = M\\_V + 5\\*log10(d) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5\\*log10(5) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5\\*(0.699) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   V = 14.995 is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17.\n    *   V = 14.995 is brighter than HIRES's limit of 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star5 is visible from and bright enough for both observatories.\n\n**Final Result**\nThe analysis shows that only Star3 and Star5 can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
