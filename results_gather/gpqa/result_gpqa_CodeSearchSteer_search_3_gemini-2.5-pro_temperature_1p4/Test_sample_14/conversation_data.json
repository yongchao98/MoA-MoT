    "The performed search confirms the initial reasoning.\n\nThe probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a random orientation of the orbit, is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n*   **P_transit ≈ R_star / a**\n\nFor a circular orbit, Kepler's Third Law states the relationship between the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_star).\n*   **P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³**\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nFrom this, we can establish the proportionality:\n*   **a³ ∝ P² * M_star**\n*   **a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)**\n\nNow, let's write down the given information in terms of ratios:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: **P1 / P2 = 1/3** or **P2 / P1 = 3**.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: **M_star1 / M_star2 = 2**.\n*   The radii of the host stars are the same: **R_star1 / R_star2 = 1**.\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n*   **Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2)**\n\nSince the stellar radii are equal (R_star1 = R_star2), this simplifies to:\n*   **Prob_1 / Prob_2 = a2 / a1**\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the proportionality from Kepler's Law:\n*   **a2 / a1 = [(P2² * M_star2) / (P1² * M_star1)]^(1/3)**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [(P2 / P1)² * (M_star2 / M_star1)]^(1/3)**\n\nSubstitute the known ratios into the equation:\n*   **a2 / a1 = [(3)² * (1/2)]^(1/3)**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [9 * 0.5]^(1/3)**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [4.5]^(1/3)**\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n*   **4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096**\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the probabilities is:\n*   **Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65**\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Consequently, Planet_1 is the preferred object for observation.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n*   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n\nFinal check of the steps. The logic is sound and the calculation is straightforward. The information provided is sufficient and the steps follow standard exoplanet theory.\n\nThe final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
