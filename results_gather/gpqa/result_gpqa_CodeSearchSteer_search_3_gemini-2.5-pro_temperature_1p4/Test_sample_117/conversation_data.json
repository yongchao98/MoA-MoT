    "The reaction in question involves an enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol) and bromine (Br₂). The starting material has both a double bond and a hydroxyl group on one of the carbons of the double bond, which defines it as an enol.\n\nThe reaction of an enol with a halogen like bromine is a standard method for the α-halogenation of a ketone. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine molecule (Br₂).\n2.  The bromine atom adds to the α-carbon (the carbon not bearing the hydroxyl group, which is C2 in this case).\n3.  This step forms an oxonium ion intermediate.\n4.  Finally, the intermediate is deprotonated at the oxygen to regenerate a very stable carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nThe result of this sequence is the replacement of a hydrogen atom on the α-carbon with a bromine atom, leading to the formation of an α-bromo ketone.\n\nLet's apply this to the specific reactant, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:\n*   The ring has five carbons.\n*   There are two methyl groups at position 4.\n*   There is a double bond between C1 and C2.\n*   There is a hydroxyl group at C1.\n\nFollowing the α-halogenation mechanism, the bromine will add to the α-carbon (C2). The hydroxyl group at C1 will then become a carbonyl group. This results in the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nOther possibilities, like the addition of bromine across the double bond to form a dibromo-alcohol (options B and D), are less likely to be the major product because the formation of the stable carbonyl group is a strong thermodynamic driving force that favors the α-halogenation pathway when an enol is the starting material.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
