    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory, and as such, its operators are constructed to be scalars under Lorentz transformations. This means they must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, this is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that is preserved in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model's weak interactions. The SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation through its higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, studying potential CP-violating operators is an active area of research.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on this, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\n<<<B>>>"
