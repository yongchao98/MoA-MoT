    "The problem has been solved by identifying the substances and reactions involved.\n\n*   **Substance B**'s melting point of ~277 K (~3.85 °C) strongly points to it being **heavy water (D₂O)**. The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. Normal water melts at 273.15 K.\n*   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope, which is identified as **Deuterium (D)** based on the presence of D₂O. Its analog (the version with hydrogen) is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   The reaction of X with a certain keto acid results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids (e.g., pyruvic acid, with 3 oxygens) have a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. A strong reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is known to reduce both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol with 2 oxygens. A milder reducing agent like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) would only reduce the ketone, leaving a product with 3 oxygens. This indicates that the analog of X is LiAlH₄.\n*   Therefore, **Substance X** is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Liquid Y**, which reacts violently with X, is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is known to react violently with water.\n*   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n*   **Gas W**, a product of this reaction, is **deuterium gas (D₂)**. A deuterium molecule (D₂) contains 2 protons (one from each D atom) and 2 neutrons (one from each D atom), matching the description that the number of neutrons and protons are equal.\n*   **Precipitate G** is a mixture of the deuterated hydroxides **LiOD and Al(OD)₃**.\n*   Heating G (specifically the aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B), D₂O.\n\nWith Substance X identified as **LiAlD₄**, the final calculation can be performed.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements**: The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope Deuterium), and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n3.  **Find their atomic masses**:\n    *   Deuterium (²H or D): The mass number is 2. The atomic mass is approximately 2.014 amu.\n    *   Aluminum (Al): It is monoisotopic with its stable isotope being Aluminum-27. The mass number is 27 and its atomic mass is approximately 26.982 amu.\n    *   Lithium (Li): Its primary stable isotope is Lithium-7, with an atomic mass of approximately 7.016 amu.\n\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative masses as per the instructions**:\n    *   Sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 deuterium atoms. Using the mass number for simplicity: 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Sum of the masses of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 aluminum atom. 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
