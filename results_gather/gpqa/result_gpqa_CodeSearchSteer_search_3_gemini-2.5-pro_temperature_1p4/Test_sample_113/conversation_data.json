    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This process forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final stable cyanohydrin product, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A's role is to provide a proton (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), is a standard and effective method for this protonation step. While the reaction can be performed using HCN generated *in situ*, an acid workup is a common procedure. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice for reagent A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis transformation involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction can be catalyzed by either acid or base in the presence of water. For acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong, dilute acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). The use of a strong acid like HCl ensures the complete conversion of the nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would not be as effective for this hydrolysis. Thus, HCl is the appropriate reagent for B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent A for the cyanohydrin formation is an acid source for the final protonation step, making **H₃O⁺** the correct choice.\n*   Reagent B for the nitrile hydrolysis is a strong acid catalyst, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
