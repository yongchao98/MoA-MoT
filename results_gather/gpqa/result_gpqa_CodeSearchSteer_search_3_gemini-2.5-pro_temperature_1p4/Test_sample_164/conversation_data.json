    "An analysis of the four statements reveals the following:\n\n*   **Statement A: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** The essential step is the oligomerization of ethylene to create α-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene, 1-octene), which serve as the branches. Research clearly shows that chromium-based catalysts, which perform this oligomerization, are typically activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). Therefore, this statement is incorrect as aluminum-based activators are in fact essential.\n\n*   **Statement B: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** While noble metals like palladium can catalyze ethylene oligomerization, they are not the preferred choice for industrial-scale production of linear alpha-olefins for polyethylene. The most successful and widely used industrial catalysts for this specific purpose are based on more economical metals like chromium. This makes the statement plausible but not the most relevant or defining characteristic of the established industrial technology.\n\n*   **Statement C: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is correct. Technologies that use one catalyst to selectively trimerize or tetramerize ethylene into 1-hexene or 1-octene, and then use a second catalyst to copolymerize these molecules with ethylene, are used industrially. Chevron Phillips Chemical, for instance, commercialized a process to produce 1-hexene from ethylene, and reactor blending with dual catalysts is an established industrial technique.\n\n*   **Statement D: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. The key technology for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to produce regular branches (via 1-hexene or 1-octene) is based on catalysts using Chromium (Cr), which is a Group VIa (also known as Group 6) transition metal. These chromium catalysts are highly effective for the selective trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene and are activated by specific co-catalysts like MAO.\n\nBoth statements C and D are factually correct. However, statement D describes the specific chemical nature of the catalyst system that enables the process mentioned in the prompt, making it a more fundamental and direct piece of information for a scientist developing such a system. The industrial implementation described in C is a direct result of the successful chemistry described in D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
