    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components, find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the solution, and then use the third dissociation constant (Ka₃) of phosphoric acid.\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of Each Component:**\n\n*   **KH₂PO₄:** This salt dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:** This salt dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n    *   Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Concentrations:**\n\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   Concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has a Ka₂ of 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nWe can use the Ka₂ expression to find [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = 8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration:**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nThe equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nWe use the Ka₃ expression:\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.106 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.237 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
