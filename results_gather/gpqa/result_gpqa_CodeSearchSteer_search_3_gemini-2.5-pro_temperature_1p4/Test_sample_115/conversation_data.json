    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows a triplet for 6 protons (6H) and a quartet for 4 protons (4H).\n*   A triplet is observed when adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (-CH2-). A signal for 6H suggests two equivalent methyl (-CH3) groups.\n*   A quartet is observed when adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (-CH3-). A signal for 4H suggests two equivalent methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n*   This specific 6H triplet and 4H quartet pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are in the alkane region. A simple alkane containing two ethyl groups is n-butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3). While the internal -CH2- protons in n-butane are technically a sextet, \"quartet\" can be a simplification in a problem statement. n-Butane is the most plausible structure for Compound A.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds B and C**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The free-radical bromination of n-butane can produce 1-bromobutane or 2-bromobutane.\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), an elimination reaction, to form Compound C.\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene, which has no geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination yields both but-1-ene and but-2-ene. But-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) is the major product (Zaitsev's rule) and exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   This confirms that Compound B is 2-bromobutane and Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D through the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of Compound C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, or Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene\n*   **Product Structure:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring. Numbering according to IUPAC rules, the product is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the transition state (endo or exo).\n    *   From the *cis*-but-2-ene dienophile, the two methyl groups (at positions C5 and C6) must be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   From the (1E,3E)-diene, the two \"outside\" substituents in the required s-cis conformation (the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4) must be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   This leads to a product where C1-OH is *cis* to C4-CH3, and C5-CH3 is *cis* to C6-CH3.\n    *   However, none of the provided options have a *cis* relationship between the substituents at C1 and C4. This indicates a probable typo in the question, and the diene should be **(1E,3Z)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n*   **Revisiting Stereochemistry with (1E,3Z)-diene:**\n    *   With a (1E,3Z)-diene, the \"out\" group (-OH at C1) and the \"in\" group (-CH3 at C4) will have a *trans* relationship in the product.\n    *   The reaction is subject to the **endo rule**, which favors the kinetic product. In the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile (C5-Me and C6-Me) are oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the \"in\" group of the diene (C4-Me).\n    *   This leads to the following relative stereochemistry:\n        1.  C1-OH is **trans** to C4-CH3.\n        2.  C5-CH3 is **cis** to C6-CH3.\n        3.  The {C5-CH3, C6-CH3} pair is **cis** to C4-CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the C1-OH group is on one side of the ring, while all three methyl groups (at C4, C5, and C6) are on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration:** Let's determine the absolute configuration for the enantiomer where C1-OH is \"up\" (wedge) and the three methyl groups are \"down\" (dashes).\n    *   This stereochemical arrangement corresponds to the enantiomer **(1R, 4S, 5R, 6S)**.\n    *   The other enantiomer, which would be formed in equal amounts, is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n**Step 4: Match with the Options**\n\n*   Comparing our derived product, (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R), with the given choices:\n    *   A) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol - Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol - Incorrect stereochemistry.\n    *   C) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol - Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol - This matches one of the expected enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
