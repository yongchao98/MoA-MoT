    "To determine the energies for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must first understand the quantum mechanical rules governing this system. The particles are fermions, as they have spin-1/2, and therefore must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as E_n = n²E.\n\nFor each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin-up (↑) and spin-down (↓). Consequently, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles:\n*   **n=1 (Energy = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed is 2 × 1E = 2E.\n*   **n=2 (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy contributed is 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is achieved by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3):\n*   **n=1:** Two particles remain, contributing 2 × 1E = 2E.\n*   **n=2:** One particle remains, contributing 1 × 4E = 4E.\n*   **n=3 (Energy = 3²E = 9E):** One particle is moved here, contributing 1 × 9E = 9E.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  **Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n2.  **Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n3.  **Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (Energy = 4²E = 16E).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing these possible excitation energies, the lowest energy after the first excited state is 18E. Thus, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
