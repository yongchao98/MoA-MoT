    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactants**: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C₆H₅CH=CHCHO) and methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reaction**: Grignard reagents are strong nucleophiles and typically react with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes via 1,2-addition, where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. While 1,4-addition is possible, it is less favored for Grignard reagents unless special conditions (like the presence of a copper catalyst) are used or the carbonyl group is sterically hindered. In this case, the methyl group from CH₃MgBr adds to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Product 1**: After an aqueous workup, the resulting product is a secondary allylic alcohol, 1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol (C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃).\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1**: Cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring, 3 in the propenal chain). The addition of the methyl group increases the count by one. Thus, Product 1 has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1 (1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol), which is a secondary allylic alcohol.\n*   **Reagent**: Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reaction**: PCC oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It is effective for oxidizing allylic alcohols without rearranging the double bond.\n*   **Product 2**: The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-). The resulting molecule is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C₆H₅CH=CHC(=O)CH₃), also known as benzalacetone.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2**: This oxidation reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. Product 2 still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one), which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Reagent**: (Dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethylsulfoxonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction**: This sulfur ylide is used in the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction to form three-membered rings. When reacting with a simple ketone, it forms an epoxide. There can be ambiguity with α,β-unsaturated ketones, as some sulfur ylides can form cyclopropanes via 1,4-addition. However, dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (the specified reagent) typically reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones at the carbonyl group (1,2-addition) to form the corresponding vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond).\n*   **Product 3**: A methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ylide is added across the carbon-oxygen double bond of the ketone, forming an epoxide ring. The structure of Product 3 is 2-methyl-2-(2-phenylethenyl)oxirane.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3**: Product 2 had 10 carbons. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds one more carbon atom from the ylide's methylene group. Therefore, the final product has 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
