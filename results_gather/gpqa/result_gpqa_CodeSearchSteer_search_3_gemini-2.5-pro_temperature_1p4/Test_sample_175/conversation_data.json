    "To determine the probability of measuring 0 for operator P and subsequently -1 for operator Q, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the Initial State\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state. The squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. Therefore, the normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n### Step 2: First Measurement (Operator P)\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue p = 0. This requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to this eigenvalue. The eigenvector |p₀⟩ satisfies the equation P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩.\n\nSolving for the eigenvector:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nFrom the first and third rows of the matrix equation, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\nFrom the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `x + z = 0` or `x = -z`.\n\nSo, the eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. A non-normalized representation is `[1, 0, -1]`. To normalize this eigenvector |p₀⟩:\n||p₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2\nThe normalized eigenvector is:\n|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector, `|⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]`] ⋅ [(1/√6) * `[[-1],,]`]\n= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3\n\nThe probability is `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n### Step 3: State Collapse\n\nUpon measuring P=0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩. The new state of the system |ψ'⟩ is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n### Step 4: Second Measurement (Operator Q)\n\nNow, we measure the operator Q on the new state |ψ'⟩. The operator Q is:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe need the probability of obtaining the result q = -1. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector |q₋₁⟩ for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n|q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is `|⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`.\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]` ⋅ [(1/√2) * `[,, [-1]]`]\n= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2\n\nThe probability is `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n### Step 5: Joint Probability\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the sequence.\nProb(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)\n= (1/3) * (1/2)\n= 1/6\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
