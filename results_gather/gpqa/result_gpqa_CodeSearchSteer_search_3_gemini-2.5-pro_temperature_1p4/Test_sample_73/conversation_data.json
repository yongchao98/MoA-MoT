    "This problem deals with the concept of radioactive decay, which is a process that is \"memoryless\". This means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its probability of decaying in the future.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes as if we were starting from time zero.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The probability of decay, P(t), within a certain time, t, is given by the formula:\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can plug this into the formula:\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival, which is e^(-λ * 100):\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate this, we can manipulate the term e^(-λ * 150) using the value we found earlier:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value of 0.68:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of decay within 150 minutes:\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nThus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
