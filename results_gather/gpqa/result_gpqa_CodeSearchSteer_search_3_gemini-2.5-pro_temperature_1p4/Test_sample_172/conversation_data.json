    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two common forms, one relating position and momentum, and the other relating energy and time. Both can be used to solve this problem.\n\n### Method 1: Using the Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle\n\nFirst, we start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle. The mathematical expression for this principle is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nFor the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nThe relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) for a particle moving at a relativistic speed *v* is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for Δp into this equation:\n\nΔE = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Method 2: Using the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle\n\nAlternatively, we can use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere, Δt is the uncertainty in time. We can estimate Δt as the time it takes for the electron to travel the distance of its position uncertainty, Δx, at its speed, v:\n\nΔt ≈ Δx / v\n\nFor the minimum energy uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\nΔE = ħ / (2 * Δt)\n\nSubstituting the expression for Δt:\n\nΔE = ħ / (2 * (Δx / v)) = (ħ * v) / (2 * Δx)\n\nThis is the same formula derived using the first method. The calculation yields the same result:\n\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ Joules. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value is closest to ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<A>>>"
