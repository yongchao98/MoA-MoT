    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct substance and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**: The substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YFₓ, where Y is the element and x is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. The formula for mass percentage is:\n\n    ɷF = (x * Atomic Mass of F) / (Atomic Mass of Y + x * Atomic Mass of F)\n\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\n    Solving for M(Y), we get: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\n\n    We can test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y:\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (similar to Bromine).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol) and Iodine (I, 126.90 g/mol).\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol.\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n\n    Let's check the mass percentages for the most likely candidates:\n    *   For **SbF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   For **IF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (126.90 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 183.90 ≈ 30.99%. This is a less accurate match.\n\n    The excellent match for Antimony suggests **Y is likely Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Clues with Y = Sb**:\n    *   **A3 from Y + F₂**: The fluorination of antimony with fluorine produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   **A3 oxidizes xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride is a very strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. This fits.\n    *   **The Reaction to form A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 ratio yields A5. The most plausible reaction involving elemental antimony and an antimony fluoride is the comproportionation: `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. In this reaction, A4 would be SbF₅ and A5 would be SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio which contradicts this balanced equation, it's common in such problems for stoichiometry to be simplified or stated incorrectly. The chemical transformation itself is sound.\n    *   **A4 is a colorless solution**: Antimony pentafluoride is a colorless, viscous liquid that can form a solution.\n    *   **A5 decomposition in water**: A5 (identified as SbF₃) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which are two different substances. This also fits.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the analysis, A4 is identified as antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now, we calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molecular Weight (SbF₅) = Atomic Mass of Sb + 5 * Atomic Mass of F\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Consider the Iodine (I) Alternative and the Options**: If we assume Y is Iodine, then A4 would likely be IF₅.\n    *   Molecular Weight (IF₅) = 126.90 + 5 * 18.998 = 221.89 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls perfectly into the range **A) 220-240**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a conflict between the clues. The mass percentage strongly points to Antimony (Y=Sb), but the resulting molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅, 216.75 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges neatly. The Iodine hypothesis (Y=I) has a less perfect mass percentage match but results in a molecular weight for A4 (IF₅, 221.89 g/mol) that fits perfectly into range A. In chemical problems of this nature, a perfect fit into a given numerical range is often the intended path. Therefore, despite the discrepancy in the initial mass percentage calculation, the most logical conclusion is that Y is Iodine and A4 is IF₅. The clues about the bright-red substance A1 and the \"five binary compounds\" are likely distractors or apply to obscure chemical knowledge, a common feature in competitive chemistry questions.\n\nThus, the substance A4 is Iodine Pentafluoride (IF₅), and its molecular weight (221.9 g/mol) falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
