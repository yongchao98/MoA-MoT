    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics principles that determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity until they create a total charge of `-q`. This induced negative charge arranges itself on the inner surface to cancel the electric field of `+q` *within the bulk of the conductor*. A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field within its material must be zero.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. This means the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` *inside* the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Outer Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Field:** According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), a uniformly charged spherical shell behaves, for all points outside the shell, as if all its charge were concentrated at its center.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is created solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This external field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n*E* = (1 / 4πε₀) * (charge / distance²)\n\nIn this case, the charge is `q` and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is:\n\n*E* = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / L²)\n\nThe location of the cavity (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `θ` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<D>>>"
