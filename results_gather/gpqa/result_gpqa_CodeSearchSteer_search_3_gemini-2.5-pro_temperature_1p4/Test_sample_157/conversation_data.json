    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to become active. The Y mutation is located in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the likely molecular events:\n*   **Dimer Formation:** A cell with one wild-type allele and one mutant Y allele will produce both wild-type and mutant protein subunits. These subunits can combine to form dimers in three possible ways: wild-type/wild-type, wild-type/mutant, and mutant/mutant.\n*   **Interference:** The defining feature of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is that the mutant subunit can still dimerize with the wild-type subunit. However, the resulting wild-type/mutant heterodimer is non-functional. This \"poisons\" the complex and prevents it from executing its function, which in this case is gene transcription.\n*   **Loss-of-Function Phenotype:** Because the mutant protein actively sequesters and inactivates the wild-type protein, the total amount of functional wild-type/wild-type dimers is significantly reduced (to 25% if the subunits dimerize randomly). This reduction is often enough to cause a loss-of-function phenotype, even though a normal wild-type allele is present. This mechanism explains the \"dominant\" nature of the mutation.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. The mutant protein must be able to dimerize to interfere with the wild-type protein. A dominant-negative mutation does not result in a wild-type phenotype.\n*   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** While some mutations can cause protein instability and degradation, the primary mechanism for this type of dominant-negative effect is the formation of inactive heterodimers, not necessarily degradation. The outcome is a loss-of-function *phenotype* due to the wild-type protein being rendered non-functional, which is the key part of this answer.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** Protein aggregation is a different mechanism of toxicity. A dominant-negative effect is more specific, involving interference with the wild-type protein's normal function, typically by forming a non-productive complex. While the outcome is a loss-of-function phenotype, \"protein aggregation\" is not the most precise description of the mechanism.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\nThe most accurate description of the outcome is the loss of function of the wild-type protein's activity, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Among the choices, protein degradation is a plausible, though not universal, mechanism that could accompany a dominant-negative mutation by destabilizing the wild-type protein through dimerization. Therefore, option B captures the correct phenotypic outcome (loss-of-function) and a possible, though not exclusive, molecular mechanism. The core issue is the \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" which is a direct consequence of the mutant protein's action.\n\n<<<B>>>"
