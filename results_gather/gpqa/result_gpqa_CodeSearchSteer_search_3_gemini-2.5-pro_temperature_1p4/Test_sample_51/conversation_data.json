    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The question asks for the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels at different temperatures. This is a direct application of the **Boltzmann equation**, which describes the population distribution of energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), an assumption provided in the problem.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level 2 (N₂) to a lower energy level 1 (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Required Ratio:** The question asks for the factor by which this population ratio changes. This means we need to calculate the ratio in the \"no spots\" case and divide it by the ratio in the \"with spots\" case.\n    *   Let T₁ be the temperature without spots (T_nospots).\n    *   Let T₂ be the temperature with spots (T_spots_eff).\n    *   Factor = (N₂/N₁)₁ / (N₂/N₁)₂\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / kT₁) / exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n    Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Temperature without spots, T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   Overall effective temperature with spots, T₂ = 5500 K.\n    *   Transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    *   The other information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is likely extraneous for this specific calculation, as the problem is reduced to comparing two states defined by their effective temperatures. Using the *overall effective temperature* for the spotted star is the most logical interpretation for a measurement of the star's integrated light.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy of a photon corresponding to a transition is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ. A useful shortcut for astronomical calculations is:\n    ΔE (in eV) = 1240 / λ (in nm)\n    *   First, convert the wavelength to nanometers: 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.\n    *   ΔE = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n6.  **Use the Correct Constants:**\n    *   Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step a:** Calculate the term (ΔE / k):\n        ΔE / k = 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K.\n    *   **Step b:** Calculate the temperature difference term (1/T₁ - 1/T₂):\n        1/6000 K - 1/5500 K = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹ = -1 / 66,000 K⁻¹.\n    *   **Step c:** Substitute these values back into the factor equation:\n        Factor = exp[ -99379 K * (-1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ]\n        Factor = exp[ 99379 / 66000 ]\n        Factor = exp[ 1.5057 ]\n    *   **Step d:** Calculate the final value:\n        Factor ≈ 4.507\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor of ~4.507 is very close to option B.\n\n9.  **Final Check:** The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., when T is lower). Our formula is `Ratio ~ exp(-const/T)`. As T decreases, 1/T increases, -1/T decreases (becomes more negative), and exp of a more negative number is smaller. This is consistent with the problem statement. The factor we calculated is (Ratio at higher T) / (Ratio at lower T), so it should be greater than 1, which it is. The logic holds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
