    "Based on the principles of planetary physics, a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times its mass will have the highest density. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This represents a planet with Earth's known average density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being slightly less than that of Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with a smaller mass exerts weaker gravitational force on itself. This results in less internal compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet's significantly greater mass leads to a much stronger gravitational pull, causing the material it's made of to become highly compressed. This phenomenon, known as gravitational compression, reduces the planet's volume for its mass, resulting in a density substantially higher than Earth's. Studies on rocky exoplanets confirm that as mass increases for planets of similar composition, density also increases due to this effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the scenarios, the planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth will be the most compressed by its own gravity and will, therefore, have the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
