    "To determine the relationship between λ1 (the mean free path of gas molecules) and λ2 (the mean free path of the electron beam), we must compare the nature of their respective collisions.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels before a collision. It is defined by the formula:\n\n**λ = 1 / (n * σ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **n** is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n*   **σ** is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area a target presents for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the scenario described, the temperature and pressure of the sample compartment remain constant. This means the number density **'n'** of the residual gas molecules is the same for both calculations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):** This mean free path depends on the collision cross-section between two gas molecules, which we can call **σ1**. This is the standard kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules.\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):** This mean free path depends on the scattering cross-section of a gas molecule as seen by an electron, which we will call **σ2**.\n\n### Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nThe relationship between the mean free paths is inversely proportional to the relationship between their cross-sections:\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2**\n\nTo determine if λ2 is greater or smaller than λ1, we must compare σ1 and σ2.\n\n1.  **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ1):** This is determined by the effective physical size of the molecules. When two molecules approach each other, their electron clouds repel, and they \"collide.\" The area in which this interaction happens is the kinetic cross-section.\n2.  **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (σ2):** This is a more complex interaction. The projectile is a tiny, point-like electron with very high energy (1000 kV). The target is a gas molecule, which consists of a dense nucleus and a diffuse electron cloud, meaning it is mostly empty space. A high-energy electron is only scattered if it passes very close to the nucleus or one of the orbital electrons. For a fast-moving electron, the probability of such an interaction over a given area is much lower than for a molecule-molecule collision. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (σ2) is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (σ1).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ2) is substantially smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ1), the mean free path for the electron (λ2) must be substantially larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n*   If **σ2 < σ1**, then **λ2 > λ1**.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 - Incorrect. The collision types are different.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small, limited amount. This is unlikely given the significant physical differences in the collision processes.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1 - Incorrect. This would imply the electron is a \"larger\" target than another molecule, which is false.\n*   **D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1** - This option correctly states that λ2 is larger than λ1 and indicates that the difference is significant (at least 22% larger). This aligns with the physical reasoning that the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller, leading to a much longer mean free path.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion is that the mean free path for the electron beam is significantly longer than the mean free path for gas-gas collisions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
