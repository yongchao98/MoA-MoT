    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is a concerted, pericyclic process that leads to an isomeric 1,5-diene. The reaction proceeds through a chair-like six-membered transition state to yield the most thermodynamically stable product.\n\nThe starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Through the rearrangement of its atoms, the product formed is 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene. This transformation results in an isomer where the carbon skeleton and substituents have been reorganized. The formation of this specific product is favored, in part, because it results in a more stable molecule, for instance, due to the pattern of alkyl substitution on the double bonds.\n\nComparing this product with the given options:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nD) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\nThe correct product, 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene, matches options B and C, which are identical.\n\n<<<B>>>"
