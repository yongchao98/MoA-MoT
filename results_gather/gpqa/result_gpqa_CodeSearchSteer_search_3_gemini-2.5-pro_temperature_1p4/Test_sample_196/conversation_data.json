    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Analysis of Compound X from IR and NMR Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield broad singlet is indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons suggests a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton suggests a -CH- group bonded to several other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl chain is a *sec*-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, attached to the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid is the other substituent.\n\n*   **Identity of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectroscopic data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\n*   The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction reaction.\n*   This specific reagent combination completely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The rest of the molecule, including the alkyl chain and the aromatic ring, remains unchanged under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determining the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
