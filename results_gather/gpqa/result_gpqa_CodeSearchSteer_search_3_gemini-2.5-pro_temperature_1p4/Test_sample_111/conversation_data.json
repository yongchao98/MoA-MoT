    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. Let's write the state as:\n|α> = N * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nTo normalize the state, the inner product <α|α> must be equal to 1. The bra <α| is:\n<α| = N* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|]\n\nThe inner product is:\n<α|α> = |N|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1\n|N|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)] = 1\n|N|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1\n|N|² * [2 + 5] = 1\n|N|² * 7 = 1\nN = 1/√7\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up> =ᵀ and |down> =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and Aij = 0 for i = j. For a 2x2 system, this gives:\nA = [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [A₂₁, A₂₂]] = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]\nA = (ħ/2) * [,] = (ħ/2)σₓ, where σₓ is the Pauli X-matrix.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation A|v> = λ|v>, which is det(A - λI) = 0.\ndet( [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] ) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\nλ² - ħ²/4 = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0\n    [[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0\n    This gives the equation -a + b = 0, so a = b.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |v₁> = (1/√2) * [,] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0\n    [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0\n    This gives the equation a + b = 0, so a = -b.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |v₂> = (1/√2) * [, [-1]] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ> is given by Pᵢ = |<vᵢ|α>|².\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2 (eigenstate |v₁>):**\n    P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2 (eigenstate |v₂>):**\n    P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average Value of A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by <A> = <α|A|α>.\n<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n<A> = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. Comparing these results with the given options, we find that option B is the correct one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
