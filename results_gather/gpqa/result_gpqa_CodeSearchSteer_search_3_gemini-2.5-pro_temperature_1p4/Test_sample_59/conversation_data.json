    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for the effects of time dilation as described by Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nFirst, we need the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located at a distance of about 163,000 light-years. For the purpose of this calculation, we will use a rounded value of approximately 160,000 light-years, as the exact distance has been measured with slight variations over time.\n\nFor an observer on Earth, the time of the journey (t_earth) would be the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is extremely close to the speed of light (c), the time would be slightly more than 160,000 years.\n*   **Time for Earth observer (t_earth) ≈ 160,000 years**\n\nFor the astronaut traveling at 0.99999987 * c, time will pass much more slowly. The time experienced by the astronaut (t_astronaut) can be calculated using the time dilation formula:\n\nt_astronaut = t_earth * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   **t_earth** = 160,000 years\n*   **v** = 0.99999987 * c\n*   **c** is the speed of light\n\nLet's calculate the term inside the square root:\n1.  v/c = 0.99999987\n2.  (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n3.  1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n4.  √(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\nt_astronaut ≈ 160,000 years * 0.0005099\n**t_astronaut ≈ 81.58 years**\n\nThis value is approximately 81.6 years.\n\nFinally, we check if the astronaut would survive the journey. The astronaut's age upon arrival would be their initial age plus the travel time:\n*   Final Age = 22 years + 81.6 years = 103.6 years\n\nSince the average lifetime of the alien species is 150 years, the astronaut, being 103.6 years old upon arrival, would survive the trip. Therefore, the most accurate option is 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
