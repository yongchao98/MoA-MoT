    "Initially, one might model the oscillating spheroid as a simple electric dipole.\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `θ` is the angle with the z-axis. The maximum power (`A`) is radiated at `θ = 90°`, where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nThe power radiated at `θ = 30°` would be proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\nThus, the fraction of the maximum power is `(1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\nThe radiated power's dependence on frequency (`ω`) and wavelength (`λ`) is:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴`\nSince `ω = 2πc/λ`, we have `P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis leads to the answer: fraction = 1/4 and wavelength dependence = `λ⁻⁴`. This corresponds to option D.\n\nHowever, a more detailed analysis considers that an oscillating spheroid, due to its shape, can also produce electric quadrupole radiation. An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with azimuthal symmetry can be a source of electric quadrupole radiation.\n\nFor an electric quadrupole source with azimuthal symmetry, the radiated power per unit solid angle has a different angular dependence:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` or `sin²(2θ)`.\n\nLet's check the fraction of maximum power for this case. The maximum of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs at `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\nAt `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(2 * 30°) = sin²(60°) = (√3/2)² = 3/4`.\nThe fraction of the maximum power is `(3/4) / 1 = 3/4`.\n\nThe power radiated by an electric quadrupole has a different wavelength dependence:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁶`, which means `P ∝ λ⁻⁶`.\n\nThis leads to the answer: fraction = 3/4 and wavelength dependence = `λ⁻⁶`. This corresponds to option A.\n\nThe question is ambiguous as to whether the dominant radiation is dipole or quadrupole. The term \"oscillating charge distribution\" in a spheroid shape strongly suggests a time-varying quadrupole moment. Simple dipole radiation arises from a net oscillating dipole moment, whereas quadrupole radiation arises from the changing shape of the charge distribution even if the net dipole moment is zero. Given the specific shape (spheroid), the electric quadrupole moment is a very natural form of radiation to consider. The options provided include both scenarios.\n\n*   **Scenario 1 (Dipole):** Fraction is 1/4, wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`. (Option D)\n*   **Scenario 2 (Quadrupole):** Fraction is 3/4, wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁶`. (Option A)\n\nThe problem phrasing asks for a *possible* form of `f`. Both are physically possible depending on the exact nature of the oscillation. However, academic and textbook problems involving oscillating spheroids often are designed to illustrate electric quadrupole radiation, as it's a classic example beyond the simpler dipole. If the oscillation preserves the center of charge, the dipole moment would be zero, and the quadrupole radiation would be the dominant form.\n\nConsidering that the question presents a specific shape (spheroid) which is a canonical example of a quadrupole radiator, and that the options directly reflect the distinct characteristics of both dipole and quadrupole radiation, it is reasonable to select the quadrupole case.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is 3/4, and a possible form of `f` includes a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
