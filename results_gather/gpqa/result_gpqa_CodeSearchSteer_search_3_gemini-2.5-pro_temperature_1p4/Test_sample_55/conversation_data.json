    "The problem asks for the specific decay route and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via a two-step dipole process.\n\n**1. Analyze the transitions using selection rules:**\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$. The options provided suggest the intermediate principal quantum number is $n'=2$.\n*   Applying the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to the initial state with $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All paths listed in the options are valid first steps according to the selection rules.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   For the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, the change in orbital angular momentum is $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number is $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$ (allowed).\n*   Thus, all three intermediate p-states can decay to the |1,0,0> ground state.\n\n**2. Determine the transition probability (branching ratio):**\n\nThe transition starts from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state (a 3s orbital), which is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThe total probability of the transition from the 3s state to the 2p level is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three m' sub-states. Since these probabilities are equal, each specific channel has a probability equal to one-third of the total probability of the 3s $\\rightarrow$ 2p transition.\n\nLet the total probability of the 3s $\\rightarrow$ 2p transition be P.\n$P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle) + P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle) + P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nSince the probabilities are equal:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle) = P/3$\n\nThe second step of the cascade, from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state, is the only allowed E1 decay channel. Therefore, it occurs with a probability of 1.\n\nThe overall probability for any of the specific two-transition routes is the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, assuming the value is from the pattern of other options)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct path and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>"
