    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to identify the starting material and the product after the reaction.\n\n### **1. Starting Material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with one double bond) with three substituents:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde).\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's determine the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n    *   Cyclohexene ring skeleton: 6 Carbons\n    *   Carboxylic acid group: 1 Carbon, 2 Oxygens\n    *   Formyl group: 1 Carbon, 1 Oxygen\n    *   Vinyl group: 2 Carbons\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n    *   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   Now, for the hydrogens: A cyclohexane has 12 hydrogens (C6H12). The starting molecule has three double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl C=O, and one in the carboxylic C=O) and one ring. The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\n*   **Initial IHD:** The index of hydrogen deficiency indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula C10H12O3.\n    *   Formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 11 - 6 = 5\n    *   Alternatively, counting from the structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### **2. Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red P and excess HI form a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Effect:** This reagent is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely down to their corresponding alkanes. It will reduce:\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### **3. Product**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce all the functional groups and unsaturation in the starting molecule.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (the double bond is saturated).\n*   The carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is not broken, the product will have the same 10 carbon atoms. The reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds.\n\n### **4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\n*   The final product is a saturated cycloalkane. It consists of a single cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents.\n*   Molecules with one ring and no multiple bonds have an IHD of 1.\n*   The molecular formula of the product will be C10H20, which corresponds to the general formula for a monocyclic alkane (CnH2n).\n*   Using the IHD formula for the product (C10H20):\n    *   IHD = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
