    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are primarily due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation. This is an epigenetic mechanism that balances the dosage of X-linked genes.\n\nIn individuals with more than one X chromosome, such as females (46,XX) and males with Klinefelter's syndrome, all but one X chromosome are largely silenced early in embryonic development. This process, which occurs after the zygote has formed, involves packaging the extra X chromosome into a compact, transcriptionally inactive structure called a Barr body. The formation of this inactive chromatin is driven by a series of epigenetic modifications, including the methylation of both histones and DNA, which are catalyzed by enzymes like histone methyltransferases.\n\nThis inactivation ensures that the gene dosage from the X chromosome is roughly equal between males (XY) and females (XX), a phenomenon known as dosage compensation. In Klinefelter's syndrome, this means one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated, bringing the expression of most X-linked genes close to the normal level found in 46,XY males.\n\nIn contrast, there is no equivalent inactivation mechanism for autosomes like chromosome 21. Therefore, individuals with Down's syndrome have three active copies of chromosome 21, leading to a significant overexpression of hundreds of genes. This larger imbalance in gene dosage is responsible for the more severe and widespread developmental effects characteristic of Down's syndrome.\n\nOptions A and C, which relate to meiotic processes, describe events that can cause aneuploidy but do not explain the subsequent difference in phenotypic severity. Option D is a general cellular process not specific to mitigating the effects of aneuploidy. Therefore, the key molecular mechanism is the epigenetic silencing of the extra X chromosome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
