    "To determine which of the listed physical theories does not require regularization at high energies, we must examine the fundamental characteristics of each theory when dealing with calculations involving very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances.\n\n**A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory describing the strong force that binds quarks and gluons. Like other quantum field theories, calculations in QCD can lead to infinities (divergences) at high energies. To handle these, QCD requires methods of regularization, such as lattice QCD, which uses a discrete spacetime lattice to act as an ultraviolet regulator. Therefore, QCD does require regularization.\n\n**B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, deals with electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with charged objects. While it is a classical theory and doesn't use the same regularization techniques as quantum field theories, it is not free from problems at high energy/short distance scales. A notable issue is the \"self-energy\" of a point-like electron, where the energy of the field created by the electron would be infinite. This suggests a breakdown of the classical theory, and while it doesn't undergo regularization in the quantum sense, it's not a theory that works without issue at arbitrarily high energies.\n\n**C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of the interaction between light and matter. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model and was one of the first theories where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully applied. Calculations of physical quantities in QED would yield infinite results without these procedures. Thus, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n**D) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the problems of quantum gravity and the divergences that appear in quantum field theories at high energies. It posits that fundamental particles are not point-like, but rather one-dimensional \"strings\". This extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at very short distances, which is the source of high-energy (ultraviolet or UV) divergences in point-particle theories. Consequently, superstring theory is believed to be \"UV finite,\" meaning it does not have these high-energy divergences and therefore does not require regularization for them.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the framework designed to be free from high-energy divergences that plague quantum field theories.\n\n<<<D>>>"
