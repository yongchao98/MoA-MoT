    "In our universe, a key principle of magnetism is that magnetic poles always come in pairs—a north and a south. An isolated north or south pole, known as a magnetic monopole, has never been observed. This empirical fact is mathematically enshrined in one of Maxwell's four fundamental equations of electromagnetism.\n\nIf a parallel universe were to permit the existence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In its standard form, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇⋅B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression for the non-existence of magnetic monopoles, signifying that magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a single point. If a magnetic monopole existed, it would act as a source (like a north pole) or a sink (a south pole) for the magnetic field. Consequently, this law would be altered to state that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρₘ), similar to how Gauss's law for electricity relates the electric field to electric charge.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (a curl in the electric field). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism would be more complete. Just as moving electric charges form an electric current that sources a magnetic field (Ampère's Law), moving magnetic monopoles would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jₘ). This magnetic current would act as a new source for a circulating electric field. Therefore, Faraday's Law would be modified to include a term for this magnetic current.\n\nIn summary, the existence of magnetic monopoles would alter the equations governing the **divergence of the magnetic field** and the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
