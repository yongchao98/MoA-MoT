    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect generally correlates with how little ortho/para product is formed. The deactivating strength is as follows: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It will produce the lowest amount of para-isomer. For instance, the nitration of nitrobenzene yields only a trace amount of the para isomer (0-5%). Bromination is similar, producing the meta-bromo isomer as the chief product under harsh conditions.\n    *   **6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It is less deactivating than -NO₂, so it will produce slightly more para-isomer than nitrobenzene, but still a very small amount.\n    *   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC₂H₅ group is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, but it is slightly less deactivating than -COOH. During nitration, it yields about 5% para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between the ortho and para isomers is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A larger substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The -CH₃ group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. For bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest as the para-isomer. This indicates a significant but not overwhelming preference for the para position.\n    *   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The -C₂H₅ group is also an activating, ortho/para-directing group. It is bulkier than the methyl group, which increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is a deactivating but ortho/para-directing group. Halogens generally give a very high proportion of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. For bromination, chlorobenzene gives a high yield of the para-isomer, often greater than that of simple alkylbenzenes.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can establish the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Meta-Directors (lowest para yield):** These will come first in the sequence. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the para yield. Thus, the order is Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n    *   **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n2.  **Ortho/Para-Directors (highest para yield):** These will come after the meta-directors. The para yield increases as the steric hindrance of the substituent increases or due to the specific electronic properties of the substituent.\n    *   For alkyl groups, steric hindrance increases with size, so para yield for Ethylbenzene (5) will be greater than for Toluene (1). So, **1 < 5**.\n    *   Halogens like Chlorine (3) are known to give very high para selectivity, often higher than alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the para yield for Chlorobenzene will be the highest among this group. So, **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Combined Order\n\nCombining the two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
