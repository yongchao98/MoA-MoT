    "The problem describes the annihilation of a slowly moving antiproton with a proton, which can be considered at rest. The annihilation results in four new particles. This is a classic application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in particle physics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible and it can be considered at rest, similar to the proton.\n    *   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   The total initial momentum is zero since both particles are effectively at rest.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The annihilation produces two positively charged particles ($2A^{+}$) and two negatively charged particles ($2A^{-}$).\n    *   All four resulting particles have the same mass, with a rest energy ($m_{A}c^{2}$) of 300 MeV.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum, the four final particles must move off in such a way that their total momentum is zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same speed, and therefore the same velocity magnitude, *v*.\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = Rest energy of proton + Rest energy of antiproton\n        $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_{p}c^{2} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Final Energy ($E_{final}$) = Total energy of the four A particles. The energy of each moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma m_{A}c^{2} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solving for Velocity:**\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Solving for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity, $v$:\n        $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088}$\n        $v \\approx c \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689c$\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
