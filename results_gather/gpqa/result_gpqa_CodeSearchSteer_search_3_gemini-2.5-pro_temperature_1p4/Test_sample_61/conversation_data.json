    "The problem asks for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\nLet's first analyze the starting material and the target product.\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane, which has the structure of a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its molecular formula is C8H12.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name indicates a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde molecule that is substituted at the C1 position (the same carbon atom of the ring that bears the aldehyde group) with a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group [-CH(OH)(C6H11)]. This structure implies a final product formed from the combination of two cyclohexyl-containing units. The molecular formula is C14H24O2.\n\nThe overall transformation involves converting a C8 molecule into a C14 molecule, suggesting a dimerization step at some point in the synthesis. The final product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is characteristic of an aldol addition product. Specifically, it appears to be the product of a self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n1.  Reacting ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 followed by ethyl chloride results in 1-cyclohexyl-1-butyne.\n2.  Reduction with Li/liq. NH3 converts the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n3.  Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (O3/H2O) cleaves the alkene to form two carboxylic acids: cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and propanoic acid.\n4.  NH4OH is a weak base that would neutralize the acids.\nThis sequence produces carboxylic acids, not the target aldehyde-alcohol. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n1.  Reaction of ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 (a strong base) deprotonates the terminal alkyne. Subsequent reaction with methyl chloride yields 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne.\n    (C6H11)-C≡CH → (C6H11)-C≡C-CH3\n2.  Hydrogenation with H2 over Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst) reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-1-cyclohexylpropene.\n    (C6H11)-C≡C-CH3 → (Z)-(C6H11)-CH=CH-CH3\n3.  Reductive ozonolysis (O3 followed by (CH3)2S) cleaves the double bond to yield two different aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    (Z)-(C6H11)-CH=CH-CH3 → (C6H11)-CHO + CH3CHO\n4.  Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) is a strong base that catalyzes an aldol reaction. In the presence of two different aldehydes, a crossed aldol reaction occurs. However, self-addition reactions also take place. The self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would yield the target C14H24O2 skeleton.\n    2 (C6H11)-CHO → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\nAlthough this sequence would produce a mixture of aldol products, it is the only option that generates the necessary precursor (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and employs the correct type of reaction (aldol addition) to form the target molecule.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n1.  Methanol (CH3OH) is a protic acid. It would protonate the acetylide anion formed by NaNH2, regenerating the starting ethynylcyclohexane. This step makes the entire sequence unproductive. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n1.  This step correctly forms 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne.\n2.  H2/Pd is a catalyst for complete hydrogenation. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane, propylcyclohexane.\n3.  The subsequent steps involve adding a base (Ba(OH)2) and then hydration reagents to an alkane, which would result in no reaction. The sequence of reagents is incorrect. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nBy elimination, and through analysis of the chemical transformations, sequence B is the only chemically plausible route to the desired product among the choices provided.\n\n<<<B>>>"
