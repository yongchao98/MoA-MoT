    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level *n* (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy) is given by the formula:\n\ng_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2\n\nFor the third excited state, n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\ng₃ = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy level E₃ = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThis corresponds to the different ways the total energy quantum number, n=3, can be distributed among the three Cartesian dimensions (n = nₓ + nᵧ + n₂):\n*   One oscillator with 3 quanta and two with 0: (3,0,0) and its permutations (3 states).\n*   One oscillator with 2 quanta, one with 1, and one with 0: (2,1,0) and its permutations (6 states).\n*   Each oscillator with 1 quantum: (1,1,1) (1 state).\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nComparing our findings with the given options:\n*   A) (9/2) ħω, 10\n*   B) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3\n*   C) (9/2) ħω, 3\n*   D) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10\n\nThe calculated energy and degeneracy match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
