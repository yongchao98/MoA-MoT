    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the spectral data and how it corresponds to the structure of trans-propenyl acetate:\n\n*   **Structure:** `CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group (`-CO-CH3(d)`). It is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to cause splitting. This is a characteristic signal for an acetate group.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet represents the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond (`CH3(a)-`). It appears as a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, `H(b)`.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton `H(b)`. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton `H(c)` and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group `CH3(a)`. This results in a doublet of quartets multiplicity.\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This doublet is assigned to the vinylic proton `H(c)`, which is deshielded (shifted downfield) due to its attachment to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom. It is a doublet because it is coupled only to the adjacent vinylic proton `H(b)`.\n\nThe crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry is the coupling constant (J-value). The observed coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond. Trans vicinal protons on an alkene typically show coupling constants in the range of 12-18 Hz. In contrast, *cis* protons exhibit a smaller coupling constant, typically between 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe \"propenyl\" part of the name is confirmed by the presence of a three-carbon `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment, distinguished from a \"butenyl\" group which would have four carbons and different corresponding signals. Therefore, the data conclusively points to trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
