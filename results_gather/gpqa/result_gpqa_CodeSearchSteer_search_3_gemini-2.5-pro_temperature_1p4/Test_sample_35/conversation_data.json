    "### The observation is of the redshifted 21-cm hydrogen line, a key tracer of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n**1. Identifying the Emission Line:**\nAn absorption line observed from a structure 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) away with an energy of 3.9 micro-electronvolts (µeV) must be corrected for the expansion of the universe (redshift) to determine its original, or rest-frame, energy. A distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5. The rest-frame energy is therefore about 5.85 µeV, calculated by multiplying the observed energy by (1+z).\n\nThis rest-frame energy of ~5.85 µeV is characteristic of the well-known 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). This line is produced by a \"spin-flip\" transition in the hydrogen atom's ground state and has a precise energy of about 5.874 µeV. This transition is fundamental in radio astronomy for studying the interstellar medium (ISM).\n\n**2. Linking the Line to a Phase of the Interstellar Medium:**\nThe question asks what is most likely observed with this absorption line *in the Milky Way*. This shifts the context from a distant galaxy to our own. The 21-cm line can be seen in both emission and absorption, and how it is observed depends on the temperature of the hydrogen gas. The interstellar medium consists of several phases with different temperatures and densities.\n\nThe two primary phases containing neutral atomic hydrogen are the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM).\n*   **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM):** This phase is characterized by low temperatures (around 100 K) and higher densities. It is the primary source of 21-cm absorption lines, which are seen when cold hydrogen gas lies in front of a brighter, background radio source.\n*   **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM):** This phase is hotter (around 6000 K) and more diffuse. Due to its higher temperature, the WNM is predominantly seen via its 21-cm emission, and it is very difficult to detect in absorption.\n\nSince the line is specified as an absorption line, it is a classic tracer of the cold, atomic gas. Therefore, the observation corresponds to the cold atomic interstellar medium. The other options are incorrect because this is a transition of atomic hydrogen, not molecular hydrogen, eliminating the \"molecular\" options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
