    "To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than that of planet #1, we must analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the planet's orbital period using the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Δλ) is caused by its \"wobble\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble represents the star's radial velocity (its motion towards or away from us). The amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is the same as the ratio of their measured wavelength shifts:\n\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude and Orbital Period**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the star's mass (Mₛ) by the following formula. The equation also includes the inclination of the orbit (*i*) relative to our line of sight.\n\n    *   K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) \\* (mₚ \\* sin(*i*)) / (Mₛ^(2/3))\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nWe are given that the two stars have identical masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂) and the two planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). To find the relationship between the periods of the two planets, we can set up a ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes:\n\n(K₁ / K₂) = [ (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) \\* (mₚ \\* sin(*i*₁)) / (Mₛ^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) \\* (mₚ \\* sin(*i*₂)) / (Mₛ^(2/3)) ]\n\nBy canceling out the constant terms (G, mₚ, Mₛ, 2π), the equation simplifies to:\n\n(K₁ / K₂) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) \\* (sin(*i*₁) / sin(*i*₂))\n\nThe orbital inclinations (*i*₁ and *i*₂) are unknown. However, for such problems, it is a standard simplification to assume that the viewing conditions are comparable, meaning the inclinations are the same (*i*₁ = *i*₂). This makes the sin(*i*₁) / sin(*i*₂) term equal to 1. The equation then becomes:\n\n(K₁ / K₂) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁):\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the wavelength shifts for the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
