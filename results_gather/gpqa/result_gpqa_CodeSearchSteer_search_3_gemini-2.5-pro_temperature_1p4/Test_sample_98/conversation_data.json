    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) double bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all options.\n    *   **Complex Splitting Patterns:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the detailed splitting patterns, which are determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (`n+1` rule).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, causing a quartet). The order (dtq) depends on the magnitude of the coupling constants (J-values), but the essential information is the neighbor count: 1, 2, and 3.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and another distinct set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing another triplet). The neighbor count is 1, 2, and 2.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each molecule, focusing on the protons on chiral centers (the `C(H)` parts of the chain), as they have the most complex environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H), and the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of two adjacent methyl groups (6H). This would result in a doublet of septets.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the protons of its adjacent methyl group (3H), and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would be a very complex signal (dqt - doublet of quartets of triplets).\n    *   This structure does not match the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)COOH`) is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, from the ethyl group attached to it), and the proton at C4 (1H). Wait, the proton at C2 is on the same carbon as the COOH. Let's re-examine the structure based on the name: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would be a ddt (doublet of doublets of triplets).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   While this structure has a complex signal, it does not have the required combination of a `dtq` and a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure implied by this formula: `CH₃(5)-CH(Hₐ)(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(H♭)(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`.\n    *   **Proton H♭ (at position 3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 (n=2), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton Hₐ on C4 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H♭ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton Hₐ (at position 4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the three protons on the terminal methyl group at C5 (n=3), which will split it into a **quartet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton H♭ on C3 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for Hₐ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\nThis molecule is the only one that contains protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
