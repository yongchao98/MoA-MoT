    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits and then apply the principles of fluorescence.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 electron volts (eV). The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) of a photon is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc/E\n\nWhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n*   c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   E is the energy in eV\n\nA common and useful approximation for this calculation is:\n\nλ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV)\n\nUsing this approximation:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n### 2. Determine the Color of Emitted Light\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### 3. Relate Emitted Color to Absorbed Color\n\nThe process described, where a substance absorbs light and then emits light at a different wavelength, is called fluorescence. A key principle of fluorescence is the **Stokes shift**, which states that the emitted photon will have a lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed photon. This energy difference is lost, typically as heat, through processes like vibrational relaxation.\n\nThis means that for the dye to emit green light (≈530 nm), it must have absorbed light with a higher energy and a shorter wavelength.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nNow let's examine the colors listed in the options based on their wavelengths and energies:\n\n*   **A) Red:** ~625-740 nm. This is a *longer* wavelength and *lower* energy than the emitted green light.\n*   **B) Blue:** ~450-495 nm. This is a *shorter* wavelength and *higher* energy than the emitted green light.\n*   **C) Violet:** ~380-450 nm. This is a *shorter* wavelength and *higher* energy than the emitted green light.\n*   **D) Yellow:** ~570-590 nm. This is a *longer* wavelength and *lower* energy than the emitted green light.\n\nBased on the Stokes shift principle, the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted 530 nm green light. This eliminates Red and Yellow as possibilities. Both Blue and Violet fit this requirement. However, in fluorescent dyes, the absorption peak is typically in the next higher energy region of the spectrum relative to the emission peak. A dye that absorbs blue light very commonly emits green light. Therefore, blue is the most plausible absorbed color that would lead to green light emission.\n\n<<<B>>>"
