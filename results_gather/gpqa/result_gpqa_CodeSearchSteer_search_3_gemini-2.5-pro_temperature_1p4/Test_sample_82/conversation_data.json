    "The initial calculations appear to be correct. The search results confirm the methodology.\n\n*   **Ka of Acetic Acid**: The provided Ka (1.85x10⁻⁵) is very close to the commonly cited values of 1.8x10⁻⁵ and 1.75x10⁻⁵. The corresponding pKa is around 4.74-4.76. My calculated pKa of 4.733 from the given Ka is accurate.\n*   **25% Titration (Buffer Region)**: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`, is the correct formula to use for this buffer region. At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the weak acid [HA] is indeed 25/75 or 1/3. My calculation of `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.26` is correct.\n*   **Equivalence Point**: At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, all the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base. The resulting solution contains the salt (sodium acetate), and its pH will be greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which acts as a weak base.\n    *   `CH3COO⁻ + H₂O <=> CH3COOH + OH⁻`\n*   **Equivalence Point pH Calculation**: The procedure I followed is confirmed by multiple sources:\n    1.  Determine the total volume and the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    2.  Calculate Kb for the conjugate base using `Kb = Kw / Ka`.\n    3.  Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base to find the [OH⁻] concentration.\n    4.  Calculate pOH from [OH⁻].\n    5.  Calculate pH from pOH (`pH = 14 - pOH`).\n\nMy calculations for the equivalence point were:\n*   Initial moles of acid = 0.001 moles.\n*   Volume of NaOH needed = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = 50.00 cm³.\n*   Concentration of acetate = 0.02 M.\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [A⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n*   pH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values (pH ≈ 4.26 and pH ≈ 8.52) are consistent with the principles of weak acid-strong base titrations and match option B exactly. No further calculations or searches are needed.\n\nFinal verification of steps:\n1.  **Dilution:** Correctly calculated the new concentration of acetic acid as 0.025 M.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** Correctly used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pKa = 4.733 and a ratio of [A-]/[HA] = 1/3, yielding pH = 4.26.\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** Correctly identified that all acid is converted to acetate. Calculated the volume of NaOH to reach the equivalence point (10 cm³), the total volume (50 cm³), and the concentration of acetate (0.02 M). Correctly calculated Kb and used it to find [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction, leading to a pOH of 5.48 and a final pH of 8.52.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nHere is a step-by-step summary for the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nThis is a buffer region, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`.\n*   First, find the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acid remains.\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, a weak base.\n*   **Moles of acid:** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** At equivalence, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):** [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:** Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:** For a weak base, [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb × [A⁻]).\n    [OH⁻] ≈ √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 8.52.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>The final detailed breakdown of the solution is provided.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both titration points.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Molarity (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this stage, the solution contains a mixture of unreacted acetic acid and the acetate formed from the reaction, creating a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer.\n\n*   **Formula:** pH = pKa + log (\\[Conjugate Base] / \\[Weak Acid])\n*   **Calculate pKa:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid is given as 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Determine the ratio:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate. This leaves 75% of the acetic acid unreacted.\n    Ratio = \\[Acetate] / \\[Acetic Acid] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the **pH at 25% titration is 4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now only contains the conjugate base, sodium acetate. The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Determine moles of acid:**\n    Moles of acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Determine volume of NaOH needed:** At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Calculate the concentration of acetate:**\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Acetate concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb:** The acetate ion reacts with water in a hydrolysis reaction (CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻). We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [Acetate]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
