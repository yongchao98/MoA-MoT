    "Based on a detailed analysis of the reaction sequence and the provided hints, Compound E is identified as **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identifying Compound A:** Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction between Compound A and a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. A Wittig reaction converts a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene. The ylide in this case is derived from acetone (`(CH₃)₂C=`), meaning Compound A is a ketone. Reversing the reaction indicates that Compound A is **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**. Hint (b) supports this, stating that Compound A has a strong IR peak around 1750 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a five-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone) due to ring strain.\n\n2.  **Compound A to B:** Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. Compound B is **1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n3.  **Compound B to C:** Compound B is reduced by hydrogen gas (H₂) in the presence of a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the nitrile group (-CN) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂). Compound C is **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n4.  **Compound C to D to E:** Compound C reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This process converts the primary amine into an unstable diazonium salt (Compound D). The diazonium salt readily loses nitrogen gas (N₂), an inert gas, to form a primary carbocation. This carbocation is highly unstable and undergoes a rapid rearrangement known as the Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement. This specific rearrangement involves the expansion of the cyclopentane ring into a more stable cyclohexane ring. The final product, Compound E, is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n5.  **Confirmation with IR Spectroscopy:** Hint (b) provides crucial confirmation. The IR spectrum of Compound E shows a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone), which is less strained than a cyclopentanone. The shift in the IR peak from ~1750 cm⁻¹ (Compound A) to ~1715 cm⁻¹ (Compound E) is a classic indicator of a ring expansion from five to six members.\n\nTherefore, the entire reaction scheme, supported by the spectroscopic data, confirms the identity of Compound E.\n\n<<<D>>>"
