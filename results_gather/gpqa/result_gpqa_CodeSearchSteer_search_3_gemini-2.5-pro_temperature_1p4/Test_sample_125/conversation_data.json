    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reagent, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack the carbonyl group from either face.\n*   **Products:** This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral dione.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an enantiomeric pair.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. It is a diastereomer of the other two isomers.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers, but it can separate diastereomers and structurally different molecules.\n\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The mixture contains an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are not separated on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, appearing as a **second peak**.\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable groups: 2 peaks from Reaction I products + 2 peaks from Reaction II products = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Chiral HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   The chiral column can distinguish between all five stereoisomers in the mixture because each one is structurally unique.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the others, will also have a unique retention time and appear as a separate peak.\n\nSince all five stereoisomers are different, the chiral HPLC will resolve the mixture into **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
