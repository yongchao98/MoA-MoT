    "Based on the spectral data provided, the unknown compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a detailed breakdown of how each piece of information leads to this conclusion:\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**:\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at **m/z = 156**.\n    *   An additional peak (M+2) is present at **m/z = 158** with an intensity that is 32% of the molecular ion peak. This characteristic 3:1 ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n    *   The molecular weight of all the potential answers (C7H5ClO2) is approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from **3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is observed. This is a classic O-H stretching vibration signal for a carboxylic acid, with the significant broadening caused by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, effectively ruling out options A (an aldehyde) and B (a phenyl chloroformate).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A singlet at **11.0 ppm** integrating to one proton (1H) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are two doublets: one at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another at **7.72 ppm (2H)**. This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (C)** is a *para*-substituted benzene ring and would produce this exact NMR splitting pattern.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (D)** is *ortho*-substituted, which would result in a more complex pattern with four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that fits all the observed data.\n\n*   **MS**: Confirms the molecular weight of 156 and the presence of chlorine.\n*   **IR**: Confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR**: Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, establishes the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
