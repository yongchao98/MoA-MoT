    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the nature of exponential decay.\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time 't' in the detector's reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN/N₀ = e**(-t / τ')**\n\nHere, τ' is the particle's lifetime as measured in the detector's frame. Due to time dilation, this lifetime is longer than the particle's proper lifetime (τ) and is dependent on the Lorentz factor (γ), as described by the equation `τ' = γτ`. The time 't' it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall is its travel distance (the radius, R) divided by its velocity (v). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light (c), so t ≈ R/c.\n\nCombining these gives the survival fraction:\n\nN/N₀ = e**(-R / (cγτ))**\n\nWe have two scenarios to compare:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n1/3 = e**(-R / (c * 20 * τ))**\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -R / (20cτ)\nln(3) = R / (20cτ)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n*   The Lorentz factor, γ₂, is what we need to find.\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = e**(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ))**\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂cτ)\nln(3/2) = R / (γ₂cτ)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. From the first scenario, we can express the constant term `R / (cτ)` as `20 * ln(3)`. We can substitute this into the equation for the second scenario:\n\nln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nSolving for γ₂, we get:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
