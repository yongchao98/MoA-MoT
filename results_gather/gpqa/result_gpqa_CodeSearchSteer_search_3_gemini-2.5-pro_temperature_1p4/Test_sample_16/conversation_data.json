    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions:\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (in its fully deprotonated form, Y⁴⁻, since the pH is assumed to be ideal). The reaction is:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:** The problem provides the formation constant (Kf), which describes the formation of the complex. The dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    *   Kf = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    *   Dissociation: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n    *   Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with the stoichiometric concentration of the complex, 0.02 M, and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| **[CaY]²⁻**     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| **Ca²⁺**        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| **Y⁴⁻**         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Simplify and Calculate:** Because the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This means the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the equation by assuming (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplification is common in these types of calculations.\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is represented by 'x'.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
