  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the cause of the expression failure, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed. The construct is designed to express the GADD45G protein with an HA tag at the N-terminus. Let's translate the beginning of the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n\nThe provided sequence starts with:\n5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGG... 3'\n\nWe can break this down into three-nucleotide codons and translate them:\n*   **ATG** -> Methionine (M). This is the universal start codon.\n*   **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC** -> This stretch corresponds to the amino acid sequence Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). This is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Therefore, option A is incorrect as the antigenic determinant has the correct sequence.\n\nNow, let's examine the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence:\n*   **AAA** -> Lysine (K). This would be the first amino acid of the GADD45G protein.\n*   **TGA** -> **STOP**. The `TGA` codon is one of the three stop codons (in addition to `TAA` and `TAG`) that terminate the process of translation.\n\nThe presence of a stop codon immediately after the first codon of the actual GADD45G gene sequence means that the ribosome will detach from the mRNA after synthesizing a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). This premature termination prevents the synthesis of the full-length protein, explaining the observed lack of expression.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The HA tag sequence is translated correctly.\n*   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. A premature `TGA` stop codon was identified in the sequence, which would cause early termination of protein synthesis.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the stop codon found in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Secondly, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, which is the mechanism for terminating translation.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker can sometimes improve protein stability, the primary issue here is the failure to produce a full-length protein in the first place, not its subsequent degradation. The premature stop codon is a more direct and definitive cause for the lack of expression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
