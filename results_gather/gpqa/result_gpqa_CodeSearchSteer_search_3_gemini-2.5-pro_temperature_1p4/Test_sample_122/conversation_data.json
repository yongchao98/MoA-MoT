    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that has passed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. Proper time is the time measured by an observer at rest relative to the event.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, this is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Determine the Goal\nThe objective is to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for distance is:\n\n**Distance = Velocity × Time**\n\nTo calculate this, we need the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame (which is given as 60,000 km/s) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n### 3. Calculate Time Dilation\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame) is called the dilated time (Δt) and is calculated using the following formula:\n\n**Δt = γ × Δt₀**\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δt** is the dilated time (time in the Galaxy's frame).\n*   **Δt₀** is the proper time (time in the ejecta's frame) = 50 s.\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n*   v = 60,000 km/s\n*   c = 300,000 km/s\n*   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.96\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n*   γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n### 5. Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)\nNow we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n*   Δt = γ × Δt₀\n*   Δt ≈ 1.0206 × 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n### 6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame\nFinally, calculate the distance traveled using the velocity and the dilated time:\n*   Distance = v × Δt\n*   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s × 51.03 s\n*   Distance ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis value is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, a more direct calculation is:\n*   Distance = v × Δt = v × (γ × Δt₀) = (v × Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Distance = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √0.96\n*   Distance = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n*   Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result without considering relativity)\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
