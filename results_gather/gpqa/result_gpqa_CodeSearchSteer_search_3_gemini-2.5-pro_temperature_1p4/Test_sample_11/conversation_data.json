    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν(μ)\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of the positive pion (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of the positive muon (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The positive pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The rest mass of the muon neutrino (ν_μ) is considered to be zero for this calculation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\nLet 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino.\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\nE_initial = m_π * c²\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\nE_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²  or  E = √((pc)² + (mc²)²)\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν = pc\n\nApplying the conservation of energy:\nm_π * c² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n**3. Calculation of Momentum**\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum, 'p'. For simplicity, we can use units where c=1 and energy and mass are in MeV.\n\nm_π = E_μ + E_ν\nm_π - pc = √((pc)² + m_μ²)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_π - pc)² = (pc)² + m_μ²\nm_π² - 2 * m_π * (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + m_μ²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\nm_π² - 2 * m_π * (pc) = m_μ²\n\nRearranging to solve for pc:\npc = (m_π² - m_μ²) / (2 * m_π)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\n*   pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n*   pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**4. Calculation of Kinetic Energies**\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**\nFor a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy and also equals its momentum (times c).\nKE_ν = E_ν = pc\nKE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\nFirst, find the total energy of the muon:\n*   E_μ = m_π - E_ν\n*   E_μ = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV\n\nNow, find the kinetic energy:\n*   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ\n*   KE_μ = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV\n\nAlternatively, using the calculated momentum:\n*   KE_μ = √((pc)² + m_μ²) - m_μ\n*   KE_μ = √(29.8² + 105.7²) - 105.7\n*   KE_μ = √(888.04 + 11172.49) - 105.7\n*   KE_μ = √(12060.53) - 105.7\n*   KE_μ = 109.82 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
