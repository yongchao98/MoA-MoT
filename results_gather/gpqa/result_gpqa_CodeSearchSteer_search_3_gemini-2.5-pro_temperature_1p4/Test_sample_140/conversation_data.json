    "This reaction is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne. The use of isotopic labeling, in this case substituting a hydrogen atom with deuterium, is a common technique to study such reaction mechanisms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the possible products:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Conditions**: The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and its isotope, deuterium, at position 2). It is treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia (NH₃) as a solvent.\n\n2.  **Elimination Step (Benzyne Formation)**: The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A: H-abstraction**: The base removes a hydrogen atom (H) from position C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium (D) atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is specifically **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B: D-abstraction**: The base can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position C2. Because the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond is stronger than a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond, this process is slower, an effect known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. Following the D removal, the bromide ion leaves from C1, creating a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, this intermediate is the non-isotopically labeled **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Addition Step (Product Formation)**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (liquid ammonia) to form the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A)**: The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   Attack at C1: This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (where the -NH₂ and -D are on adjacent carbons).\n        *   Attack at C6: This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (where there is one carbon between the -NH₂ and -D groups).\n\n    *   **From benzyne (Pathway B)**: The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2). Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the final product after protonation is the same: non-deuterated **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
