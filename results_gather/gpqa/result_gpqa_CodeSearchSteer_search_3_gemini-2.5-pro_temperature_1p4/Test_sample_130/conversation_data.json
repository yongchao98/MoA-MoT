    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data are characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent protons on the double bond account for the single ¹H NMR peak, while the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons account for the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. This structure has methyl groups on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a methylene (CH₂) group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The carbons C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The carbons C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The maleic anhydride adds across the diene to form the rest of the bicyclic framework.\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect the following ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups.\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (they are next to quaternary bridgehead carbons, so no coupling).\n        *   Two 1H signals for the two non-equivalent protons of the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   A cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the newly formed C=C double bond. This places the anhydride protons (a 2H singlet) in close proximity to the vinylic methyl groups (a 6H singlet).\n    *   ***Exo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are closer to the C7 methylene bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Assign Resonances and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The distinctive NOESY correlation in the major (*endo*) product will be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's assign the chemical shifts given in the options based on typical values:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (2H singlet):** These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. **~1.7 ppm** is a good fit.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** These are on saturated, quaternary carbons and are expected to be more shielded. **~1.0 ppm** is a likely value.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (1H doublets):** The methylene bridge protons in norbornane systems appear around 1.2-1.8 ppm. **~1.5 ppm** fits this range.\n    *   The cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our shift assignments, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product are the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
