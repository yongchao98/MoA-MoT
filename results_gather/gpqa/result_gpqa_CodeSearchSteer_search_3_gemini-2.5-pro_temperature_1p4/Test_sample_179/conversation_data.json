    "To determine the minimum energy of the system of 13 identical particles, we need to find the configuration that minimizes their total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of 12 particles, each with charge q = 2e, constrained to a sphere of radius r = 2 m, and a 13th particle with the same charge q = 2e fixed at the center of the sphere, P.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  **U_center**: The potential energy due to the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **U_sphere**: The mutual potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n### Minimum Energy Configuration on the Sphere\nThe problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of N identical charges on the surface of a sphere is known as the Thomson problem. For N=12, the charges will arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular icosahedron to minimize their mutual repulsion.\n\n### Calculation of Potential Energy\n\n**1. U_center:**\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance r = 2 m from the central charge. The potential energy between the central charge (q) and one charge (q) on the sphere is given by Coulomb's law: `U = k * q^2 / r`. Since there are 12 such charges, the total energy of this interaction is:\n`U_center = 12 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n\n**2. U_sphere:**\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges arranged in an icosahedron is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges. For an icosahedron of circumradius `r`, there are three distinct distances between vertices:\n*   The distance to the 5 adjacent vertices is the edge length `a`.\n*   The distance to the 5 next-nearest vertices is `b`.\n*   The distance to the single opposite vertex is `2r`.\n\nThe total number of pairs is (12 * 11) / 2 = 66. These pairs are distributed as:\n*   30 pairs at distance `a`.\n*   30 pairs at distance `b`.\n*   6 pairs at distance `2r`.\n\nThe potential energy is therefore:\n`U_sphere = k * q^2 * (30/a + 30/b + 6/(2r))`\n\nThis can be written in terms of the radius `r` by using the geometric properties of the icosahedron:\n*   `a = (r/2) * sqrt(10 - 2*sqrt(5))` which gives `r/a ≈ 0.95105`\n*   `b = a * φ`, where `φ = (1+sqrt(5))/2` is the golden ratio. This gives `r/b = (r/a)/φ ≈ 0.58778`\n\nSo, `U_sphere` can be expressed as:\n`U_sphere = (k * q^2 / r) * (30 * (r/a) + 30 * (r/b) + 3)`\n`S_12 = 30 * (0.95105) + 30 * (0.58778) + 3`\n`S_12 ≈ 28.5315 + 17.6334 + 3 = 49.1649`\nThus, `U_sphere = 49.1649 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n\n**Total Energy:**\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere`\n`U_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / r) + 49.1649 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_total = (12 + 49.1649) * (k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_total = 61.1649 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   Charge `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353 × 10^-19 C`\n*   Radius `r = 2 m`\n*   Coulomb's constant `k = 8.98755179 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `k * q^2 / r`:\n`q^2 = (3.204353 × 10^-19 C)^2 ≈ 1.026788 × 10^-37 C²`\n`k * q^2 / r = (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.026788 × 10^-37) / 2 J`\n`k * q^2 / r ≈ 4.61424 × 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, we calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = 61.1649 * (4.61424 × 10^-28 J)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8220 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places gives `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.822 x 10^-26\nB) 122.330\nC) 5.645 x 10^-26\nD) 7.056 x 10^-27\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
