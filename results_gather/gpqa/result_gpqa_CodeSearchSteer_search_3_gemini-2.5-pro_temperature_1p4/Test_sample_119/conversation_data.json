    "The initial derivation is a standard method in astronomy and appears correct. The search results confirm the underlying principles but do not provide the direct derivation of `dN/d(plx)`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to confirm the final answer:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n\n2.  **Number of stars in a spherical shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius *d* and thickness *dd*.\n    *   The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (*dN*) within this volume is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance to parallax:** The parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*). For the standard units of parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, the relationship is: `d = 1 / plx`.\n\n4.  **Convert the differential distance (dd) to a differential parallax (d(plx)):** We need to express *dd* in terms of *d(plx)*. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n    *   `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   When considering the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as one value increases, the other decreases). `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute into the star count equation:** Now, substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* into the equation for *dN*:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`, changes with *plx*. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find this quantity:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
