    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of acid and base present and then determine which species is in excess after all reactions have completed.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each substance.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates to produce two moles of hydroxide ions (OH-) for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.\n\nThe reactions will occur in order of strength. The strong acid (HCl) will react with the strong base (Ba(OH)2) first.\n\n*   **Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ ions will be completely consumed by the excess OH- ions.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Strong Base - Weak Acid Neutralization:**\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely consumed by the excess OH- ions.\n    *   Final moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.050 moles of the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final pH.\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions from the strong base. The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess strong base, as its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is far more significant than that of the weak conjugate base (acetate) formed.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
