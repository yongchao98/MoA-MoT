    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene with Maleic Anhydride\n\nWhen cyclooctatetraene (COT) is heated, it undergoes a reversible electrocyclic reaction to form a small amount of its valence tautomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This tautomer contains a reactive 1,3-cyclohexadiene system.\n\nThis reactive diene then undergoes a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with maleic anhydride, which acts as the dienophile. Under thermal conditions, Diels-Alder reactions, particularly with cyclic dienes, predominantly form the kinetically favored *endo* adduct.\n\nThe resulting **Product 1** is *endo*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,7-diene-9,10-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 is then treated with methanol (MeOH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The acid catalyzes the opening of the anhydride ring by methanol, followed by the esterification of the resulting carboxylic acid groups to form a dimethyl ester.\n\nThis reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the polycyclic framework. The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) will be *cis* to each other and will retain the *endo* configuration established in the first step. **Product 2** is therefore dimethyl *endo,cis*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]deca-3,7-diene-9,10-dicarboxylate.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Final Product 3\n\nProduct 2 reacts with cyclopentadiene in a second Diels-Alder reaction. In this step, cyclopentadiene is the diene, and Product 2 is the dienophile. Product 2 possesses two double bonds: one in a six-membered ring and one in a strained four-membered (cyclobutene) ring. The strained cyclobutene double bond is the more reactive dienophile.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of this reaction is determined by steric hindrance. The molecule of Product 2 has a cage-like structure with the two bulky ester groups located on the concave (*endo*) face. The incoming cyclopentadiene will approach the cyclobutene double bond from the less sterically hindered convex face. This is described as an *exo* attack relative to the cage structure of Product 2.\n\nThis highly stereoselective reaction leads to the formation of a single major diastereomer (as a racemic mixture). The newly formed methano bridge (from cyclopentadiene) is positioned *anti* to the two ester groups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves two highly stereoselective Diels-Alder reactions.\n1.  An *endo* addition of maleic anhydride.\n2.  An *exo* addition of cyclopentadiene (relative to the existing molecular framework).\n\nThis specific stereochemical pathway leads to the major isomer described in option C.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the major isomer of product 3 is:\n**name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n\n**SMILES: O=C(OC)[C@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O**\n\n<<<C>>>"
