    "The self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with a Grubbs catalyst results in six possible stereoisomeric products, excluding ethene.\n\nThe reactant, 3-methylpent-1-ene, is a chiral alkene. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of the (R) and (S) enantiomers. Olefin metathesis involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. In this case, two molecules of 3-methylpent-1-ene react to form a new, longer alkene (3,6-dimethyl-4-octene) and ethene, which the question specifies to exclude.\n\nBecause the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three reaction pairings are possible:\n*   **(R) + (R):** This reaction produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Due to the new double bond, both E and Z isomers can form. These two isomers are diastereomers of each other.\n*   **(S) + (S):** This pairing yields (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene, which also exists as a pair of E and Z diastereomers. These two products are the enantiomers of the products from the (R) + (R) reaction.\n*   **(R) + (S):** This cross-reaction produces (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Again, both E and Z isomers are possible. These two products are meso compounds, meaning they are achiral despite having chiral centers, due to internal symmetry. They are diastereomers of each other and of the other four products.\n\nIn total, this reaction yields two pairs of enantiomers and two meso compounds, resulting in six unique stereoisomeric products. While standard Grubbs catalysts do not typically control the E/Z geometry of the resulting double bond, leading to a mixture, different stereoisomers are still considered distinct products.\n\nTherefore, the six possible products are:\n1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\n<<<B>>>"
