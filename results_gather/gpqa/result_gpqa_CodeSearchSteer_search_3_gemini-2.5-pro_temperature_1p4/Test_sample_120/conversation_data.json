    "The reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Based on the established principles of such reactions, two key rules apply:\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me‚Åª) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Identify the epoxide carbons and determine the site of attack**: The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" indicates a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused at positions C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Determine the stereochemical outcome**:\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (6S) as given in the name.\n    *   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. Thus, the S configuration becomes R.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction, as no bonds are broken or formed at these positions.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure and IUPAC name of the product**:\n    *   The nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide. Subsequent workup with water protonates the resulting alkoxide at C1, forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The adjacent carbon, which was attacked (originally C6), is now C2.\n    *   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n4.  **Assign the stereochemistry to the product**:\n    *   **C1**: The configuration is retained from the starting material. Original C1 was (1R), so the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2**: This was originally C6. Its configuration inverts from (6S) to (2R).\n    *   **C4**: This was originally C3. Its configuration is retained as (3R), which corresponds to (4R) in the new numbering system.\n    *   **C5**: This was originally C4. Its configuration is retained as (4R), which corresponds to (5R) in the new numbering system.\n\nCombining these assignments gives the full name of the product as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
