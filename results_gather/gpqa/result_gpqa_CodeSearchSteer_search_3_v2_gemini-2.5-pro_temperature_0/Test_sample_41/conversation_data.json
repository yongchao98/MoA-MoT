    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to the properties of its star and its orbit. The formula is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star for a circular orbit).\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, A, and R_star are constant for all three. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\nThis can be rewritten to express the orbital distance in terms of temperature:\n\na ∝ 1 / (T_eq)²\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the ratios of the orbital distances.\n\nWe are given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n\n*   **Ratio of a2 to a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   **Ratio of a3 to a2:**\n    a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply these two ratios:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.37\n\n### Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law.\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n\n(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n\nWe want to find the ratio P3 / P1. Using the ratio of the orbital distances we just calculated:\n\n(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³ ≈ (10.37)³\n\n(P3 / P1)² ≈ 1115.3\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ sqrt(1115.3) ≈ 33.4\n\nThe information about the planets' masses and the TTV detection method is not required for this specific calculation, which relies on the relationships between temperature, distance, and orbital period.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
