    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a strong base like KOH at high temperatures is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. Specifically, this reaction can proceed via a Grob fragmentation. The initial step is likely the substitution of one bromine atom with a hydroxyl group, forming 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane. The subsequent formation of an alkoxide under basic conditions triggers the fragmentation of the adamantane cage, leading to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\nThis structure for Product 1 is consistent with the provided spectroscopic data:\n*   **Formula**: C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **IR Spectrum**: An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The two protons of the exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) are vinylic and account for the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). The remaining 12 protons of the bicyclic framework correspond to the signals at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged. Thus, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nWe need to identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one) and determine its coupling pattern.\n\n1.  **Most Deshielded Proton**: In this keto-alcohol, the possible non-exchangeable protons are those on the bicyclic framework. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded. Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is significantly further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) and other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Coupling Pattern of H-C3**: The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 exists predominantly in a chair-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7. The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Each of these positions (C2 and C4) is a methylene group (CH₂), so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is equivalent to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Within each methylene group (e.g., C2), the two protons (axial and equatorial) are not equivalent and will have different coupling constants (J-values) to H-C3. Let's denote the coupling to the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_A and the coupling to the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_B.\n    *   In a chair conformation, the axial-axial coupling constant (J_A) is typically large (~10-13 Hz), while the axial-equatorial coupling constant (J_B) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since H-C3 couples to two equivalent protons with a constant J_A and to another two equivalent protons with a different constant J_B, the resulting splitting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
