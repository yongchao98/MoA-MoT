    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically for a carboxylic acid which absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed in the 1620-1680 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-7 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the carboxonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the spectral data, the unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: C₆H₁₂O₂ and C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU represents the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is:\n\n**DoU = C + 1 - (H / 2)**\n\n*   Our data indicates the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    A DoU of 1 can account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid, but not for the additional C=C double bond.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings, accounting for both the C=O double bond and the C=C double bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence strongly supports the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms and has the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
