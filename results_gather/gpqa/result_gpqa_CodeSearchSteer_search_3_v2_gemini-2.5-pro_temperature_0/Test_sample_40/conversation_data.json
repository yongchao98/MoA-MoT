    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step derivation of the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference\n*   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n*   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n### 2. Define the Velocities\n*   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n*   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n### 3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula\nThe special theory of relativity provides a formula for adding velocities that ensures the combined velocity never exceeds the speed of light. The formula for collinear motion is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n### 4. Substitute the Known Values\nNow, we substitute the values from our problem into this formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n### 5. Simplify the Expression\nLet's simplify the equation:\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the formula for the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in a moving medium and was a key experiment in the development of special relativity.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\n*   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n*   B) 1\n*   C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n*   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nOur derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
