    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, which means the fields observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* were generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time is determined by the condition that the time difference $t - t_r$ is equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. This can be written as:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe derivation of the potentials involves integrating the retarded charge and current densities. A key factor that emerges from this derivation is a term in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal.\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\nwhere $\\vec{n} = \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}$ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n\nSubstituting $\\vec{n}$ and simplifying the denominator gives:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSo, the scalar potential becomes:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Comparing these derived expressions with the given options, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
