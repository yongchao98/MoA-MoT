    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Calculating the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\n1.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:**\n    First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺). Fe(OH)₃ is a base and reacts with the acid in a neutralization reaction.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\n2.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    We calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ using the atomic masses of its constituent elements (Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol).\n    Molar Mass = 55.85 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    The problem states we are dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 moles.\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Required:**\n    Using the stoichiometry from step 1, we find the moles of H⁺ needed.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\n5.  **Volume of Acid:**\n    The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The minimum volume needed is the volume that contains 0.002807 moles of H⁺.\n    Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    To convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000.\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\n### Part 2: Calculating the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\n1.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    After dissolution, the 0.0009356 moles of Fe³⁺ are in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009356 M.\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:**\n    The iron(III) ion is a Lewis acid and hydrolyzes in water, producing H⁺ ions and making the solution acidic. The hydrated ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ acts as a weak acid.\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Calculation:**\n    To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. Published pKa values for [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ are typically around 2.1 to 2.5. Let's use a common value, pKa = 2.2, which corresponds to Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³.\n\n    We set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n| Species | [Fe³⁺] | [Fe(OH)²⁺] | [H₃O⁺] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Initial | 0.009356 | 0 | 0 |\n| Change | -x | +x | +x |\n| Equilibrium| 0.009356 - x | x | x |\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H₃O⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    Substituting the values:\n    6.31 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    This requires solving a quadratic equation: x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.90 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.\n    Solving for x (which represents [H₃O⁺]) gives:\n    x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n\n4.  **Final pH:**\n    pH = -log₁₀([H₃O⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Volume ≈ 28.07 cm³\n*   pH ≈ 2.29\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option C (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. The calculated pH (≈2.3) is in the same acidic range as option C's pH (2.04), although not identical. The discrepancy in pH may arise from the specific Ka value used in the problem's design, which is not provided. However, the volume calculation is based on fundamental stoichiometry and is very reliable. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
