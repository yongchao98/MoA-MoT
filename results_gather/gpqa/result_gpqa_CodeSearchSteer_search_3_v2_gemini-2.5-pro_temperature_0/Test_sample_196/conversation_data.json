    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its infrared (IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.2 ppm (2H)**, suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe a *sec*-butyl group:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine (-CH) proton, which is deshielded because it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂) group adjacent to the methine.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methine proton.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to the methylene group.\n\nCombining these observations, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product Identification\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydriodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to alkanes. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group on the ring is unaffected by these conditions.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid functional group to a methyl group. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
