    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α⟩\n\nThe state is given as being proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. Let's define the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\n|ψ⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant N such that the normalized state |α⟩ = N|ψ⟩ satisfies ⟨α|α⟩ = 1.\n\nThe inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [ (1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down| ] ⋅ [ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ ]\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1 - i²) + (4 - i²)\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant N is 1/√⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1/√7.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ ]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up⟩ =ᵀ and |down⟩ =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ 1+i, 2-i ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and Aij = 0 for i = j. This gives the matrix:\nA = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\nλ₁ = +ħ/2\nλ₂ = -ħ/2\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n\nFor λ₁ = +ħ/2:\n(A - λ₁I) |v₁⟩ = 0\n[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\nThis gives the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y. The eigenvector is proportional toᵀ.\nThe normalized eigenvector is |v₁⟩ = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩).\n\nFor λ₂ = -ħ/2:\n(A - λ₂I) |v₂⟩ = 0\n[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0\nThis gives the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y. The eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]ᵀ.\nThe normalized eigenvector is |v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ⟩ is given by P(λᵢ) = |⟨vᵢ|α⟩|².\n\n**Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\nP(λ₁) = |⟨v₁|α⟩|²\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (⟨up| + ⟨down|) ] ⋅ [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩) ]\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ]\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\nP(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n**Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\nP(λ₂) = |⟨v₂|α⟩|²\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (⟨up| - ⟨down|) ] ⋅ [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩) ]\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ]\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\nP(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of A is given by ⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩.\n⟨A⟩ = Σᵢ λᵢ * P(λᵢ)\n⟨A⟩ = (λ₁)P(λ₁) + (λ₂)P(λ₂)\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2)(9/14) + (-ħ/2)(5/14)\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n⟨A⟩ = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
