    "The search results confirm my manual calculation.\n\n*   Several sources state that for the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν), the kinetic energy of the resulting muon is about 4.1 MeV.\n*   One source specifically calculates the muon kinetic energy as 4.12 MeV using rest masses of 139.57 MeV for the pion and 105.66 MeV for the muon, which are very close to the values given in the problem.\n*   Another source, using slightly different mass values (in terms of electron mass), calculates the muon kinetic energy to be 4.08 MeV and the neutrino energy to be 29.65 MeV.\n*   The formula I derived for the momentum of the decay products, `p * c = [(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * (m_π * c²)]`, is a standard result in two-body decay kinematics.\n\nMy calculated values were:\n*   KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values match option B. The search results strongly support this conclusion.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** E_initial = E_final\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** p_initial = p_final\n    0 = p_μ + p_ν  => |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n3.  **Relativistic Relations:**\n    For the neutrino (massless): E_ν = KE_ν = p*c.\n    For the muon (massive): E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)².\n    Also, E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c².\n4.  **Solving for KE_μ:**\n    (KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (KE_μ + m_μ*c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    Substitute KE_ν = 33.9 - KE_μ:\n    (KE_μ + 105.7)² = (33.9 - KE_μ)² + (105.7)²\n    KE_μ² + 2(105.7)KE_μ + 105.7² = 33.9² - 2(33.9)KE_μ + KE_μ² + 105.7²\n    211.4 * KE_μ = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_μ\n    279.2 * KE_μ = 1149.21\n    KE_μ = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n5.  **Solving for KE_ν:**\n    KE_ν = 33.9 - 4.116 = 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculations are correct and confirmed by external sources. The answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n\nThe decay process is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺ (m_π * c²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺ (m_μ * c²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν * c² = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (m*c²).\n    E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c²\n    E_ν = KE_ν + m_ν * c² = KE_ν (since the neutrino is massless)\n    So, E_final = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + KE_ν\n\nEquating initial and final energies:\n139.6 MeV = KE_μ + 105.7 MeV + KE_ν\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 - 105.7\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV  (This is the total kinetic energy released)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Relating Energy and Momentum:**\nWe can now relate the momentum (p) to the kinetic energies.\n*   **For the massless neutrino:** Its energy is entirely kinetic, and E_ν = p*c. Therefore, KE_ν = p*c.\n*   **For the massive muon:** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)².\n    We also know that E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c².\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nWe can solve for the kinetic energies by combining these equations. A direct formula for the kinetic energy of the muon (particle 1 in a two-body decay from rest) is:\nKE_μ = [(m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(m_μ * c²)] / [2 * m_π * c²]\nThis can be simplified from the energy-momentum relations. Let's use the equations we derived:\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, p_μ*c = p_ν*c = p*c.\nFrom conservation of energy, m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν.\nE_ν = p*c\nE_μ = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² )\n\nSo, m_π*c² = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² ) + p*c\nm_π*c² - p*c = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² )\n\nSquare both sides:\n(m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nSimplify and solve for p*c:\n(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2(m_π*c²)(p*c)\np*c = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π*c² ]\np*c = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\np*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\np*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its momentum times c:\n**KE_ν = p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon using the total kinetic energy calculated earlier:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.78\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is confirmed by multiple physics resources.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
