    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∇⋅f, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field is given by f(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume to the net flux of the field through the surface enclosing that volume. The theorem is stated as:\n\n∫∫∫V (∇⋅f) dV = ∬S (f ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface.\n\nHowever, a crucial point is that the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) **r̂** has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where it is undefined. A direct calculation of the divergence of **f** for r ≠ 0 gives:\n\n∇⋅f = 0 (for r ≠ 0)\n\nThis might suggest that the volume integral of the divergence is zero. However, the singularity at the origin contributes to the integral. The Divergence Theorem can still be applied, and it correctly accounts for the source at the origin.\n\nLet's calculate the surface integral (the flux) of the vector field **f** over the sphere of radius R:\n\n1.  The vector field on the surface of the sphere (where r=R) is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  The differential surface area element d**S** on the sphere is directed radially outward, so d**S** = **r̂** dS, where dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ in spherical coordinates.\n3.  The dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** is [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ]. Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, this simplifies to sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n4.  Now, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The angle θ ranges from 0 to π, and the angle φ ranges from 0 to 2π.\n\n∬S (f ⋅ d**S**) = ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ\n\n5.  Evaluating the integrals:\n    *   ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ = 2π.\n\n6.  The total flux is the product of these two results: 2 * 2π = 4π.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. Therefore, the value of the integral is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin.\n\n<<<C>>>"
