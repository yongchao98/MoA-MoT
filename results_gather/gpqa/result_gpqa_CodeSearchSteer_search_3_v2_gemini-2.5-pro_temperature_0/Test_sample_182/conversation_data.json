    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the chemical transformation it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **Formyl group**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl group**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   **Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones**: It reduces carbonyl groups (C=O) completely to methylene groups (-CH₂-) or methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Reduction of Carboxylic Acids**: It reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes**: It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, this reaction will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all double bonds, converting the molecule into its corresponding alkane while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will transform the functional groups and unsaturations as follows:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **vinyl group** at C5 becomes an **ethyl group**.\n*   The **double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nThe resulting product is a saturated cycloalkane: **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**. The carbon skeleton consists of a six-membered ring and four additional carbon atoms from the side chains, making a total of 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀). Since it is a fully saturated monocyclic alkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   (Oxygen and sulfur atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of one ring or one double bond. Since the product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, a saturated molecule, the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
