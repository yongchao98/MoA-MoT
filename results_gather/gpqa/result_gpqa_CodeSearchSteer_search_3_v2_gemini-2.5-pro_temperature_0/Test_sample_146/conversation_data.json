    "The annihilation of a proton and an antiproton is a process governed by the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum. In this specific case, the initial particles are a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$), which annihilate to produce four new particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n\nTo determine the velocity of the resulting A particles, we can apply the law of conservation of energy. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which in the context of particle physics typically implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Therefore, we can approximate the total initial energy as the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n**1. Initial Energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's equation, $E = mc^2$.\n*   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so its rest energy ($m_{\\bar{p}}c^2$) is also 938.3 MeV.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of mass $m_A$, where the rest energy $m_A c^2$ is given as 300 MeV. Due to the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the final state, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four particles. The energy of each moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n\n$1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nThe velocity of particle A ($v_A$) can be found from the Lorentz factor:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $v_A/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n\n$\\beta = \\frac{v_A}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
