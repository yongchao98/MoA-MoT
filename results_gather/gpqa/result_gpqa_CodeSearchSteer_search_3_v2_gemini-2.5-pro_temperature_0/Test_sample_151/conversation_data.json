    "The formation of a shmoo in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a response to mating pheromone, which causes the cell to arrest its cell cycle in the G1 phase and prepare for mating. This state is characterized by large-scale changes in gene expression, but a halt in DNA replication. The experiment described aims to identify proteins on *active chromatin* using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS). In this context, \"active chromatin\" refers to regions of the genome undergoing active transcription.\n\nHere is an analysis of the protein complexes listed:\n\n*   **B) pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, which includes RNA Polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles at gene promoters to start transcription. Since shmoo formation involves the activation of many mating-specific genes, the PIC would be highly abundant on active chromatin.\n*   **C) nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, composed of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Both active and inactive chromatin are packaged into nucleosomes, although histones in active regions are often chemically modified. Therefore, these complexes would be ubiquitously recovered.\n*   **D) enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences that bind activator proteins (transcription factors) to boost the transcription of specific genes. The pheromone response is driven by such transcription factors, which bind to enhancers of mating-specific genes. These complexes are a key feature of the active chromatin in a shmoo.\n*   **A) pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" them for DNA replication in the subsequent S phase. However, the pheromone signal that induces shmoo formation also causes a G1 cell cycle arrest, specifically preventing the cell from entering S phase and initiating DNA replication. While the pre-RC is assembled during G1, the cell cycle arrest prevents its activation.\n\nGiven that the shmoo state is defined by active transcription and an inactive replication process, the proteins least associated with the *active* chromatin functions would be those of the pre-replication complex.\n\n<<<A>>>"
