    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The periodic shift in a star's spectral line (Δλ) is caused by its motion along our line of sight, an effect known as the Doppler shift. The magnitude of this shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum measured wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio is K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the host star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   `mₚ` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `Mₛ` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term `mₚ sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method.\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the expression for K for each of the two star-planet systems:\n\n    K₁ = ( (2πG) / P₁ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) / (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3)\n    K₂ = ( (2πG) / P₂ )^(1/3) * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of K₂ to K₁:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (P₁/P₂)^(1/3) ] * [ (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ] * [ (Mₛ₁ + mₚ₁)^(2/3) / (Mₛ₂ + mₚ₂)^(2/3) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information**\n    Let's simplify this ratio using the details from the problem description:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\" and the stars have masses \"similar to that of our Sun\". This means the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (mₚ << Mₛ). Therefore, we can approximate (Mₛ + mₚ) ≈ Mₛ. With Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂, this term cancels out.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and both have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of RV discoveries, this implies that their measured minimum masses (`mₚ sin(i)`) are similar. Thus, (mₚ₂ sin(i₂)) / (mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) ≈ 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    Substituting these simplifications into the ratio equation, we get:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So:\n\n    1.4 ≈ (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we first cube both sides:\n\n    (1.4)³ ≈ P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 ≈ P₁ / P₂\n\n    Now, we invert the expression to find the desired ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
