    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to analyze the given potential.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates using the relations:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. This is known as a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential can be written as `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n*   `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y^2`\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the total energy `E` of the system is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form `V(z) = 1/2 mω^2z^2` are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. We need to find the angular frequencies (`ω_x` and `ω_y`) for our system.\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nWe compare `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2` with the standard form `1/2 mω_x^2x^2`.\n`mω_x^2 = 4k`\n`ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n`E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nWe compare `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2` with the standard form `1/2 mω_y^2y^2`.\n`mω_y^2 = k`\n`ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n`E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\n**Total Energy Spectrum:**\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of `E_{n_x}` and `E_{n_y}`.\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nHere, `n_x` and `n_y` are the quantum numbers for the x and y directions, respectively, and can take any non-negative integer value (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
