    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model. As such, it must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is built upon the principles of quantum field theory, where Lorentz invariance is a foundational requirement. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations, is also a fundamental symmetry that all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must respect.\n\n2.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of local quantum field theory. It states that any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is formulated within this framework, all its operators must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity inversion (P). Unlike the other symmetries listed, CP symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself, for instance in the weak interactions. SMEFT, being an extension of the SM, is designed to parameterize not only the known sources of CP violation but also potential new sources from physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, SMEFT contains operators that are CP-violating, and this symmetry is not a requirement for all operators.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
