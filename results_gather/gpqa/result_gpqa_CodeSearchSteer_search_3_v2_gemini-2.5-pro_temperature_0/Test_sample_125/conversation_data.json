    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The chirality is at the C5 carbon, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them enantiomers. They are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe combined mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate peak**.\n    *   This results in **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers in a mixture.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers can be separated, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
