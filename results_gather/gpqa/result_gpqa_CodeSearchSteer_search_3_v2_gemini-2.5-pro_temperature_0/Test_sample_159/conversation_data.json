    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the angular distance between the first two minima.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Aperture\nThe problem begins with an N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems have the same length, 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n\n### Step 2: Diffraction by a Circular Aperture\nWhen monochromatic light with wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far-field. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central spot called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Locating the Intensity Minima\nThe angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = m * λ / d\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   d is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nMore precisely, the angular positions of the minima are given by:\n\nsin(θ) = zₙ / (k * r)\n\nwhere:\n*   r is the radius of the aperture (in this case, r = a).\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   zₙ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nSubstituting k, we get:\n\nsin(θₙ) = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n\nθₙ ≈ (zₙ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n*   The first zero, z₁, is approximately 3.8317.\n*   The second zero, z₂, is approximately 7.0156.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n\nThis is often approximated using the diameter (d=2a), where the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / d = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a.\n\nNext, we calculate the angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\nSome sources also provide the position of the second minimum as approximately sin(θ) = 2.23 * λ / D, which gives θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a, a very similar value.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Angular Distance\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\nThis result is very close to the value given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
