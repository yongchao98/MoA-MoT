    "The detailed analysis of the multi-step synthesis confirms the predicted structure of product 4. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n(R)-(+)-Limonene has two carbon-carbon double bonds: a trisubstituted endocyclic (within the ring) double bond and a disubstituted exocyclic (outside the ring) double bond. Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C and one equivalent of hydrogen gas (H₂) preferentially reduces the less sterically hindered and more reactive exocyclic double bond. This reaction converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group, yielding product 1, which is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene. The stereocenter at C4 remains in the (R) configuration.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\nProduct 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene, is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), a common reagent for epoxidation. The epoxidation reaction is stereoselective. The bulky isopropyl group at the C4 position directs the m-CPBA to attack the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (anti-attack). This results in the formation of an epoxide ring *trans* to the isopropyl group. A detailed stereochemical analysis using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules reveals that the major product (Product 2) is the (1S, 2S, 4R)-epoxide.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. Under these basic conditions, the methoxide ion (MeO⁻) attacks the epoxide ring. The reaction follows an Sₙ2 mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide. In this case, the attack occurs at C2 (a tertiary carbon) rather than the more substituted C1 (a quaternary carbon). An Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked. Since C2 in the epoxide has an (S) configuration, the attack by the methoxide ion inverts it to an (R) configuration. The stereocenter at C1 is not part of the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. Therefore, Product 3, the resulting alcohol, has the stereochemistry (1S, 2R, 4R).\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\nProduct 3, which is (1S, 2R, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol, is then treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This set of reagents is used for a Steglich esterification, which converts the tertiary alcohol at C1 into a propionate ester. This esterification reaction does not affect any of the existing stereocenters.\n\nThus, the final product, Product 4, retains the stereochemistry of Product 3 and is named **(1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
