    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Conditions for Transit\n\nA planet transits a star when its orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The geometry of a transit is described by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at their closest approach, measured in units of the star's radius.\n\nFor a transit to occur, the center of the planet must pass over the star's disk. This means the impact parameter `b` must be between 0 (for a central transit) and 1 (for a transit across the star's edge). Therefore, the maximum impact parameter for a transit is `b_max = 1`. While a planet could technically graze the star if `b` is slightly larger than 1 (up to `1 + R_planet/R_star`), the standard definition for a full transit event requires the planet's center to cross the stellar disk, so we use `b_max = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Impact Parameter to Orbital Properties\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the impact parameter `b` is given by the formula:\n\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n\n### Step 3: Use Planet 1's Data to Constrain the System\n\nWe are given the following for Planet 1:\n*   Impact parameter (`b1`) = 0.2\n*   Orbital period (`P1`) = 3 days\n\nUsing the formula for the impact parameter for Planet 1:\n\n`0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_star`\n\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both. The stellar radius `R_star` is also the same. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the constant term `cos(i) / R_star`:\n\n`cos(i) / R_star = 0.2 / a1`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximum Orbit for Planet 2\n\nWe want to find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2, which corresponds to its maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`). This will occur at the maximum possible impact parameter for a transit, which is `b2_max = 1`.\n\nUsing the impact parameter formula for Planet 2 at its maximum orbit:\n\n`b2_max = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_star`\n`1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_star`\n\nNow, we can substitute the term we found in Step 3:\n\n`1 = a2_max * (0.2 / a1)`\n\nRearranging this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes gives:\n\n`a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\nThis tells us that the maximum semi-major axis of Planet 2 is 5 times the semi-major axis of Planet 1. Note that the radii of the star and the planets were not needed for this calculation.\n\n### Step 5: Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for all objects orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). This can be written as a ratio:\n\n`(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n\nWe can now solve for the maximum period of Planet 2 (`P2_max`) using the known period of Planet 1 (`P1 = 3` days) and the ratio of the semi-major axes we just found:\n\n`(P2_max / 3)^2 = (5)^3`\n`P2_max^2 / 9 = 125`\n`P2_max^2 = 9 * 125`\n`P2_max^2 = 1125`\n`P2_max = √1125 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
