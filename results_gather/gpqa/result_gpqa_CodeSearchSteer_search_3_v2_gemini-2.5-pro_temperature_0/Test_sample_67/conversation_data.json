    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, Sz.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment is no longer aligned with the field. The magnetic field exerts a torque on the magnetic moment, causing it to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic moment (μ), the spin angular momentum (S), and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is given by μ = γS. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field B is H = -μ ⋅ B.\n\nThe equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is given by the torque equation `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B)`. This equation shows that the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial state has the spin aligned along the Z-axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` is applied along the Y-axis.\n*   The spin vector, and thus the magnetic moment, will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment will oscillate as its projection onto the Z-axis changes over time.\n*   The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
