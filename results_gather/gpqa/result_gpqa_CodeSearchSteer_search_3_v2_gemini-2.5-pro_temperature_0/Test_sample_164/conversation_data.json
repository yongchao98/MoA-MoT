    "To determine the correct statement, each one must be evaluated based on established principles and industrial practices in ethylene polymerization and oligomerization. The overall goal is to produce branched polyethylene using only ethylene, which requires a dual-catalyst system: one catalyst polymerizes ethylene, while the second oligomerizes ethylene into α-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), which are then incorporated as branches.\n\n*   **Statement A: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n    The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins. Research and industrial processes show that aluminum-based activators (co-catalysts) such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) are not only effective but often essential for activating the oligomerization catalysts, particularly chromium-based systems. Studies demonstrate that the choice of aluminum activator can significantly influence catalytic activity and product selectivity, with MMAO often yielding high productivity for 1-octene. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n*   **Statement B: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n    Group VIa (more commonly known as Group 6) includes chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are well-known and commercially used for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and 1-octene. For instance, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company developed and industrialized a process using a chromium catalyst for the on-purpose production of 1-hexene, a key comonomer for linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). These catalyst systems require activation by specific co-catalysts, typically aluminum alkyls. This statement is therefore correct.\n\n*   **Statement C: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n    Noble metals like palladium (Pd) have been shown to catalyze ethylene oligomerization. However, the major industrial processes for producing α-olefins from ethylene, such as the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP) and the Chevron Phillips process, are based on more cost-effective non-noble metals like nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), respectively. While catalytically active, the high cost of noble metals generally makes them economically unviable for large-scale commodity chemical production like this, so the statement is factually plausible. However, the industry has actively developed non-noble metal catalysts which are the standard.\n\n*   **Statement D: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n    The technology to produce α-olefins from ethylene using a selective catalyst (like the chromium-based system) is implemented on an industrial scale in the US by companies like Chevron Phillips. This α-olefin is then used as a comonomer to produce branched polyethylene. This confirms that the core technology described is in industrial use. Dual-catalyst systems for producing polymers with specific properties are also a known industrial strategy. Thus, this statement is also correct as it reflects the industrial reality that is enabled by the chemistry described in statement B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth statements B and D are factually correct. However, statement B describes the fundamental chemical principle (the type of catalyst used), which is the direct enabler of the industrial process mentioned in statement D. The use of a Group VIa metal like chromium is a specific, well-documented, and foundational fact of this technology. Given that the question asks to identify a correct statement from the list, and statement B is a direct, unambiguous chemical fact central to the proposed experiment, it stands as a definitively correct assertion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
