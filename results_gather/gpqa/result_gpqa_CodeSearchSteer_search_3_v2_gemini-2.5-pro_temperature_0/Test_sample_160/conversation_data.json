    "The conclusion about λ2 is that it will be smaller than λ1. This is because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, and the collision cross-section for an electron scattering with a gas molecule is larger than that for two gas molecules colliding.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. It is defined by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where 'n' is the number of target particles per unit volume (number density) and 'σ' is the effective collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Constant Conditions:** In the scenario described, the sample compartment's temperature, pressure, and volume are constant. This means the number density (n) of the residual gas molecules is the same for both calculations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from a difference in their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n3.  **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** The cross-section represents the effective area that a particle presents as a target for a collision.\n    *   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This mean free path is determined by gas molecules colliding with each other. The relevant cross-section (σ_gas) is based on the physical size of the molecules and the short-range forces between them.\n    *   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This mean free path is determined by the high-energy electrons from the beam scattering off the gas molecules. The relevant cross-section (σ_e-gas) is based on the electromagnetic interaction between the charged electron and the neutral gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections:** The interaction between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral gas molecule is a longer-range force than the interaction between two neutral gas molecules. Because the electron can be deflected by the molecule's electromagnetic field from a greater distance, the effective target area it \"sees\" is larger. Consequently, the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas collision (σ_e-gas > σ_gas).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), the larger cross-section of the electron-gas interaction results in a shorter mean free path.\n\nTherefore, λ2 (electron-gas MFP) will be less than λ1 (gas-gas MFP).\n\n<<<A>>>"
