    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG).\n\n1.  **Identify the state and parameters:**\n    The state is the Schrödinger cat state: |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>) / N.\n    The given parameters are φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5.\n    For φ = -π/4, we have cos(-π/4) = 1/√2 and sin(-π/4) = -1/√2.\n    The state becomes |ψ> = (1/N√2) * (|α> - |-α>), which is known as an odd Schrödinger cat state.\n\n2.  **Understand the measure of non-Gaussianity:**\n    The measure is the relative entropy `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`.\n    This can be rewritten as `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`, where `S(rho) = -trace(rho*ln(rho))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n    The state `rho` is a pure state (`rho = |ψ><ψ|`), and the von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\n    Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n    The non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `del_b = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the reference Gaussian state `tau`:**\n    `tau` is a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the state `rho`. For an odd cat state, the first moment (average displacement) is zero. The state is also not squeezed. This means the reference state `tau` is a thermal state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean photon number `n`:**\n    The mean photon number `n` of the reference thermal state `tau` must be equal to the mean photon number of the cat state `rho`. For an odd cat state, the formula for the mean photon number is:\n    n = |α|² * coth(|α|²)\n    Given α = 0.5, we have |α|² = 0.25.\n    n = 0.25 * coth(0.25)\n    n = 0.25 * (e⁰⁵ + 1) / (e⁰⁵ - 1)\n    Using the value e⁰⁵ ≈ 1.64872, we calculate:\n    n ≈ 0.25 * (1.64872 + 1) / (1.64872 - 1)\n    n ≈ 0.25 * (2.64872 / 0.64872) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207\n\n5.  **Calculate the entropy of the thermal state `S(tau)`:**\n    The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state with mean photon number `n` is given by the formula:\n    S(τ) = (n + 1)ln(n + 1) - n*ln(n)\n    Substituting n ≈ 1.0207:\n    S(τ) ≈ (1.0207 + 1)ln(1.0207 + 1) - 1.0207*ln(1.0207)\n    S(τ) ≈ 2.0207 * ln(2.0207) - 1.0207 * ln(1.0207)\n    S(τ) ≈ 2.0207 * (0.70345) - 1.0207 * (0.02049)\n    S(τ) ≈ 1.4214 - 0.0209 ≈ 1.4005\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.40. Looking at the options:\n    A) 2.48\n    B) 0\n    C) 1.38\n    D) 0.25\n\n    The calculated value of 1.40 is closest to option C) 1.38. It is worth noting that if the mean photon number `n` were exactly 1, the entropy would be S(1) = 2*ln(2) ≈ 1.386. The discrepancy suggests a possible inconsistency in the problem's given values, but based on a direct calculation, 1.38 is the most plausible choice among the options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
