    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will determine how many of the seven listed compounds are optically active.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. The presence of these R/S designations indicates that this is a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which can be seen when the molecule is in an eclipsed conformation, or a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a -CH=CH-CH2- portion of the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- portion of the ring. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer and therefore optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the carbon atom opposite to it in the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure of this compound is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is in turn bonded to a 3-methylbutyl group. The chemical structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule; the carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
