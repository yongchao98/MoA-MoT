    "The search results confirm the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Diels-Alder Reaction and Stereochemistry**: The reaction between a cyclic diene (like a cyclopentadiene derivative) and maleic anhydride produces a bicyclic adduct. The major product is typically the *endo* isomer due to kinetic control, which involves favorable secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* isomer is the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product.\n\n2.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   **Diene**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This has a C5 ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   **Dienophile**: Maleic anhydride.\n    *   **Adduct**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The bridge is the CH₂ group (C7 in bicyclic nomenclature). The double bond is between the carbons that were C2 and C3 of the diene. The anhydride ring is fused to the other two carbons.\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n3.  **NMR Spectroscopy and NOESY**:\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* and *exo* isomers is the spatial relationship between the anhydride protons and the bridge (CH₂) protons.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. This NOE interaction will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Signal Assignment from the Question**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This chemical shift is characteristic of the protons on the anhydride ring, which are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This signal corresponds to one of the protons of the CH₂ bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and would couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. This uniquely identifying cross-peak must be the one connecting the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the signal for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the signal for one of the bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
