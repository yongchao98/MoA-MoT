  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "This is a problem of genetic interpretation. Let's break down the data to understand the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, but it's not the only gene involved.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% drop in resistance, indicating it has a more significant role than G1.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants (Gene Interactions)\n\n1.  **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both of these double mutants show 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, this is a classic example of **epistasis**. The gene whose phenotype is expressed in the double mutant (`g2`) is said to be epistatic to the other gene (`g1` or `g3`). This suggests that G2 acts in the same pathway as G1 and G3, and its function is absolutely required, masking the effects of the other mutations. Given the complete loss of function and the prompt stating one gene is an upstream transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates the entire pathway, its absence would naturally lead to 0% resistance, regardless of the status of downstream genes like G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **g1g3 mutant:** The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance and the `g3` mutant has 50%. The `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant and is also more severe than a simple additive effect (a 25% loss from g1 and a 50% loss from g3 would leave 25% resistance, not 10%). This strong synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping, compensatory functions. This relationship is often described as **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is strongly supported by the data, as the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3` and results in a total loss of the phenotype.\n    *   **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** This is also supported. The synergistic effect in the `g1g3` double mutant is a hallmark of redundancy.\n    *   **G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` mutant's phenotype (10% resistance) should be the same as the `g1` mutant's phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** Correct.\n    *   **G1 and G3 has the same promoter:** This cannot be determined from the given phenotypic data.\n    *   **G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   **G1 is a transcription factor:** This is unlikely. The `g1` mutant has the mildest phenotype, which is not typical for a master regulator of a pathway.\n    *   **G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This part is correct, as the `g1g2` phenotype (0%) matches the `g2` phenotype (0%). However, the first statement makes the option incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** Correct.\n    *   **G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot conclude this.\n    *   **G1 is epistatic towards G3:** Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A contains two correct and significant conclusions drawn directly from the experimental data: G2's role as a likely transcription factor and the redundant/synergistic relationship between G1 and G3. Although its third statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, it provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic network among the choices. The other options contain more significant errors or statements that cannot be verified by the experiment. Therefore, Option A is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
