    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first understand the relationship between the energy of emitted and absorbed light in a process like fluorescence.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nWhere 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A simplified formula for converting energy in electron volts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n### 2. Relate Emitted and Absorbed Light\nThe process described is fluorescence, where a molecule absorbs a photon, becomes electronically excited, and then emits a new photon to return to a lower energy state. Due to energy loss through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) between absorption and emission, the emitted light always has a lower energy and a longer wavelength than the absorbed light. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\nTherefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted green light (530 nm).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\nNow let's examine the given options based on their position in the visible spectrum relative to green light:\n*   **A) Red:** Has a longer wavelength (~620-750 nm) and lower energy than green light.\n*   **B) Violet:** Has a shorter wavelength (~380-450 nm) and higher energy than green light.\n*   **C) Blue:** Has a shorter wavelength (~450-495 nm) and higher energy than green light.\n*   **D) Yellow:** Has a longer wavelength (~570-590 nm) and lower energy than green light.\n\nBased on the principle that absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted light, both blue and violet are possible answers. However, the absorption and emission spectra for a given molecule are often relatively close. For a molecule that emits green light (530 nm), the most probable absorption peak would be in the adjacent higher-energy region of the spectrum, which is blue light. For example, a sample excited with violet light at 405 nm might fluoresce at 512 nm (green). This makes blue the most plausible color of light absorbed to cause green emission.\n\n<<<C>>>"
