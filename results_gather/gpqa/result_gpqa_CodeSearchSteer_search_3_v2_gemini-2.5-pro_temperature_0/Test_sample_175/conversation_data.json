    "To determine the probability of obtaining a specific sequence of outcomes in quantum measurements, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics regarding measurement and state collapse. The process involves calculating the probability of the first measurement, determining the new state of the system after the first measurement, and then calculating the probability of the second measurement on this new state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Initial State and Normalization**\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`. First, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state vector is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Operator P**\nThe first measurement is of the observable P, and we are interested in the outcome 0. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0:**\n    The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    We need to find the vector `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]` such that `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`. This leads to the system of equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0` which implies `y = 0`.\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` which implies `x = -z`.\n    The un-normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is `[1, 0, -1]`. Normalizing this vector gives the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`:\n    `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability is `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) ⋅ ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1])`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse**\nAfter measuring the value 0 for P, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**4. Second Measurement: Operator Q**\nThe second measurement is of the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`, and we are interested in the outcome -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    This probability is calculated on the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`: `Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1])`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Total Probability**\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n`Prob(P=0 and Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
