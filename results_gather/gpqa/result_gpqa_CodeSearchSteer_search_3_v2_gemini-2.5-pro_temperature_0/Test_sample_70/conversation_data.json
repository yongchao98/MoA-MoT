    "The search results confirm the steps and formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is derived from the balance between the energy a planet absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is given as T_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) / (4 * d^2) ]^(1/4) * R_star^(1/2), where 'd' is the distance from the star, 'A' is the albedo, T_star is the star's temperature, and R_star is the star's radius. For a given star, T_eq is proportional to (1/d^2)^(1/4) = 1/sqrt(d). Since the orbits are circular, the distance 'd' is the semi-major axis 'a'. So, T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit (P² ∝ a³). This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n3.  **Combining the relationships**:\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula, we have T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, we have a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting the second proportionality into the first gives: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T4) and Planet_2 (T2) is:\n        T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\n4.  **Calculating the ratio**:\n    *   The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   From this, the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7.\n    *   Now, we calculate the temperature ratio: T4 / T2 = (4/7)^(1/3).\n    *   (4/7) ≈ 0.5714.\n    *   The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.8298.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is ~0.83, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance (d) from the star, assuming the same stellar properties and albedo:\n    T_eq ∝ 1/√d\n\n    Since the planets are in circular orbits, the distance 'd' is the same as the semi-major axis 'a'.\n    T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\n2.  **Relate the orbital distance to the orbital period using Kepler's Third Law.** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine these relationships to find the connection between equilibrium temperature and orbital period.** By substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's law into the temperature relationship, we get:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.** The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 (T4) to that of Planet_2 (T2) can be expressed as:\n    T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Use the given orbital period ratios.** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n\n6.  **Compute the final temperature ratio.** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T4 / T2 = (4/7)^(1/3)\n    T4 / T2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    T4 / T2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
