    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Position-Momentum Uncertainty:**\n\nFirst, we use the position-momentum uncertainty principle. The formal inequality relates the standard deviation of position (Δx) and the standard deviation of momentum (Δp). The principle is expressed as:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nFrom this, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n**2. Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty:**\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) through the particle's velocity (v). The relationship is given by the formula:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nThis relationship holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases. It can be derived by considering the derivative of energy with respect to momentum (dE/dp), which is equal to the particle's velocity.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nCombining the two relationships, we get:\nΔE ≈ v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE ≈ (10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
