    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two main criteria must be met: the star's apparent brightness must be within the detection limits of both instruments, and the star must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations.\n\n### 1. Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude)\n\nA star must be bright enough for both spectrographs.\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 16 (V < 16).\n*   **Combined Limit:** For a star to be observable by both, it must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 (V < 16).\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs (pc) using the distance modulus formula: m - M = 5 * log10(d) - 5. If there is interstellar dust, the light is dimmed by an amount called extinction (A_V), which must be added to the calculated apparent magnitude.\n\n*   **Star 1:** With an absolute magnitude (M_V) of 15.5 at a distance of 10 pc, the apparent magnitude (m_V) is equal to the absolute magnitude, so m_V = 15.5. This is brighter than 16.\n*   **Star 2:** The apparent magnitude is given as m_V = 16.5. This is not brighter than 16.\n*   **Star 3:** The apparent V magnitude is stated as 15.5 mag. Assuming this is the final observed magnitude, it is brighter than 16. The additional information on color excess is considered extraneous for this calculation.\n*   **Star 4:** Starting with an absolute magnitude of 15.5 at 10 pc, its un-extincted apparent magnitude is 15.5. We must add the extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. The final apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74. This is not brighter than 16.\n*   **Star 5:** With an absolute magnitude of 16.5 at a distance of 5 pc, the apparent magnitude is calculated as m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15.0. This is brighter than 16.\n\nBased on brightness alone, Star 1, Star 3, and Star 5 are candidates.\n\n### 2. Sky Visibility (Declination)\n\nA star must rise above the horizon at both observatories. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of about -24° S. It can observe stars with declinations roughly between +66° and -90°.\n*   **Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located on Mauna Kea at a latitude of about +20° N. It can observe stars with declinations roughly between -70° and +90°.\n*   **Combined Visibility:** For a star to be seen from both sites, its declination must be in the overlapping range, which is approximately **-70° to +66°**.\n\nNow, let's check the declination of the candidate stars:\n*   **Star 1:** DEC = -75°. This is south of the -70° limit for Keck and is therefore not visible from Hawaii.\n*   **Star 3:** DEC = +48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n*   **Star 5:** DEC = +60°. This is also within the observable range for both.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both criteria, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet the requirements for both brightness (V < 16) and sky visibility (-70° < DEC < +66°).\n\n*   **Star 3:** m_V = 15.5 (Pass), DEC = +48° (Pass) -> **Observable**\n*   **Star 5:** m_V ≈ 15.0 (Pass), DEC = +60° (Pass) -> **Observable**\n\nTherefore, the correct option is Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
