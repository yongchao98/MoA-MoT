    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Determine the Mass Dimension of Each Component\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action, S, is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫d⁴x L`.\n\n*   **Lagrangian Density (L):** Since the four-volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4 to make the action dimensionless. This means the interaction term `L_int` must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is `L_fermion = ψ_bar(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing the derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1, the dimension of the fermion field `ψ` must be [ψ] = 3/2. Consequently, `[ψ_bar]` is also 3/2.\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_em = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, the dimension of `F^μν` must be [F^μν] = 2.\n*   **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν` is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by `L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_μν ψ F^μν`. We can now set up an equation for the mass dimensions:\n\n[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν]\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\n4 = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2\n4 = [κ] + 3 + 2\n4 = [κ] + 5\n[κ] = 4 - 5\n[κ] = -1\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Determine the Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining whether a quantum field theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if > 0).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because, in a perturbative expansion, higher-order corrections would involve increasingly divergent integrals, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb the infinities, which would make the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
