    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it emits. This is the most common and dominant form of radiation from a compact source.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `A` represents the maximum power radiated per unit solid angle, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`. To find this, we can calculate `sin²(30°)`:\n\n`Fraction = sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThus, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power `A`.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe function `f` representing the radiated power per unit solid angle also depends on the wavelength `λ` of the radiation. For electric dipole radiation, the power is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency `ω`. The relationship between frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. This is a key characteristic of both electric dipole radiation and Rayleigh scattering.\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power's dependence on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. While other forms of radiation exist, such as electric quadrupole radiation (which has a `λ⁻⁶` dependence), electric dipole radiation is the dominant mechanism for a simple oscillating charge distribution as described.\n\n<<<B>>>"
