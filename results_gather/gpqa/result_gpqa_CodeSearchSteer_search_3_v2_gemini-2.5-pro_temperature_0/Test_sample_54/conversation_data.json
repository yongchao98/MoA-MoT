    "To identify the unknown organic compound, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for the four possible structures: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons, resulting in a singlet. This is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four possible compounds contain this group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d). This means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This pattern fits a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) but not a butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃), which would show a triplet for the terminal methyl group. This observation rules out both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals are in the alkene region (typically 5-8 ppm) and represent the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to one other proton.\n    *   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it is coupled to one proton (the \"d\") and also to a group of three protons (the \"q\"). This matches the structure where this proton is adjacent to both the other vinyl proton and the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vicinal protons on a double bond is dependent on their stereochemistry. A *trans* configuration typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of 12-18 Hz. A *cis* configuration shows a smaller coupling constant, generally between 6-12 Hz. The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinyl protons.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  The singlet at 2.1 ppm confirms an acetate group.\n2.  The doublet at 1.6 ppm indicates a methyl group attached to the double bond, pointing to a propenyl structure.\n3.  The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) for the vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm confirms a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\nCombining these findings, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
