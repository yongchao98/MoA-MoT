    "### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This creates a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To form the final product, this intermediate must be protonated to create the hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. H₃O⁺, the hydronium ion, represents a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and serves as an excellent proton source for this step. Often, the reaction is performed by adding a strong acid to a mixture of the carbonyl compound and sodium cyanide.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. Among the choices provided, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a standard reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction involves heating the nitrile with the dilute acid under reflux. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and would not be effective for this hydrolysis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the suitable reagents are:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
