    "Here is the breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, forming a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n*   **Product (A):** The initial addition product is protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent. The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. The IUPAC name for this product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile at the α-carbon. This is a variation of the Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Product (B):** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H3O+) hydrolyzes the resulting iminium salt intermediate back to a ketone. The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position. The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), is a classic Michael acceptor.\n*   **Product:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This means the `-(CH₂)₂COCH₃` group (the remnant of MVK after addition) has been added to the C2 position of the starting nucleophile.\n*   **Reactant (C):** For the `(3-oxobutyl)` group to be attached to the C2 position, the starting nucleophile must be the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyl groups, which then attacks the MVK.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
