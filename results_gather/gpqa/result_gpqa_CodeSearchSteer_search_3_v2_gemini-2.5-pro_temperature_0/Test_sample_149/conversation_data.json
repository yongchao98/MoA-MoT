    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The provided 1H-NMR data is analyzed to determine the structure of the starting compound:\n*   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group).\n*   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (the -CHO proton). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n*   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n*   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments (a para-substituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group) gives the structure 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step produces 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Treating this aldehyde with a base (KOH) and heat initiates an aldol condensation.\n    *   First, the base removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, option C).\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction under heat to yield the final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
