    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### Understanding the Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\n\nHere, `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of atoms of elements A and B, respectively. The term \"dex\" stands for \"decimal exponent,\" which is another way of saying this is a base-10 logarithmic scale.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance of Star_1\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nFrom `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`, we can write:\n`log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0`\n`log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun`\n\nFrom `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`, we have:\n`log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun`\n\nWe want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `log10(n_Si/n_H)_1`. We can express this as:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 + log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from above:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = (0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun) + log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + (log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun)`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10((n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun)`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance of Star_2\n\nFor Star_2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nFrom `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`, we get:\n`log10(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = 0`\n`log10(n_Mg/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun`\n\nFrom `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`, we have:\n`log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 - log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = 0.3`\n`log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 0.3 + log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun`\n\nWe need to find `log10(n_Si/n_H)_2`. We can rearrange the abundance of magnesium relative to hydrogen:\n`log10(n_Mg/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_2`\nTherefore:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_2`\n\nSubstitute the known expressions:\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun - (0.3 + log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun)`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun - 0.3 - (log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun)`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun - 0.3 - log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun`\n`log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 = log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun - 0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon abundances, `(n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2`, which is equivalent to `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\nLet the ratio be `R`.\n`R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`\n\nTo find `R`, we can first calculate the logarithm of the ratio:\n`log10(R) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)`\n\nSubstitute the results from Step 1 and Step 2:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun - 0.3)`\n`log10(R) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `R` by taking the antilogarithm:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information regarding the stellar masses and the absolute abundances of Fe and Mg in the Sun are not required for this calculation, as the relative abundances are sufficient.\n\n<<<C>>>"
