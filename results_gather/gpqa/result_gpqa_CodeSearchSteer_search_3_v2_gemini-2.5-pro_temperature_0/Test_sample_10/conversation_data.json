The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n\nHere is an analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **Statement A is correct.** Studies have shown a linear correlation between the in vitro frameshifting rate and the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. [2, 14] Optical tweezer experiments have demonstrated that the frameshifting elements of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two distinct conformations when placed under tension, which is consistent with their frameshifting efficiency. [2, 14, 21]\n\n*   **Statement B is correct.** The SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein has been shown to induce apoptosis by triggering the activation and cleavage of caspase-8. [1, 5] This process occurs without altering the expression levels of Bcl-2, a key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. [1, 6] Since caspase-8 activation is a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, this indicates that ORF3a initiates apoptosis through this mechanism. [1, 5]\n\n*   **Statement C is correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a mechanism that produces two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. [2, 14] This occurs when the ribosome pauses at a \"slippery sequence\" and, stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot, shifts its reading frame back by one nucleotide. [10, 13] This process happens at the junction of Open Reading Frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b, which are located in the 5' half of the viral genome. [13] Furthermore, structural analyses have confirmed that the frameshifting pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a nearly identical conformation. [2, 20]\n\n*   **Statement D is incorrect.** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does form a heterodimer that functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) in a proofreading/mismatch repair mechanism. [4, 16] The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 is stimulated by its interaction with nsp10. [15, 16] However, the function of this active exonuclease complex is to **excise or degrade** the 3' end of the newly synthesized RNA strand to remove mismatched nucleotides. [4, 15] It does not **prevent** the breakdown of dsRNA; rather, it selectively causes breakdown to ensure replication fidelity. [4, 17]\n\n<<<D>>>"
