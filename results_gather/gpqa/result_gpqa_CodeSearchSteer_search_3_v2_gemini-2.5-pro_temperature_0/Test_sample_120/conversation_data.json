    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate is a nucleophilic ring-opening. The user prompt and chemical principles confirm two key rules for this reaction.\n        *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n        *   **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n2.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), the oxygen atom at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n        *   Original C1 → New C1 (has an -OH and a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C6 → New C2 (has the newly added -CH₃)\n        *   Original C5 → New C3\n        *   Original C4 → New C4 (has a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C3 → New C5 (has a -CH₃)\n        *   Original C2 → New C6\n    *   The resulting molecule is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged. The original configurations were (3R) and (4R). In the renumbered product, these correspond to C5 and C4, so the product has (4R, 5R) configurations.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is where the epoxide was opened to form an alcohol, but the substitution reaction does not happen at this carbon. Its configuration is retained. The original configuration was (1R), and it remains (1R) in the product.\n    *   The key change occurs at C6 (which becomes C2 in the product). The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack, which causes an inversion of configuration. The starting material has a configuration of (6S).\n    *   Inversion of the (S) configuration at this carbon results in an (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
