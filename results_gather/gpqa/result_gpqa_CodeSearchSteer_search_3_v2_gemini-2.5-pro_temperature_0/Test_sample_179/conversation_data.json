    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The total energy is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges in the system.\n\nThe system consists of:\n*   A central charge, `q_c = 2e`, fixed at point P.\n*   12 charges, `q_s = 2e`, constrained to a spherical surface of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nThe total energy `U_total` can be divided into two parts:\n1.  `U_center-sphere`: The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere-sphere`: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**1. Energy of Interaction between Central Charge and Sphere Charges (`U_center-sphere`)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance `R = 2 m` from the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is `k * q_c * q_s / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant and `q_c = q_s = 2e`.\n\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / R) = 48 * k * e^2 / R`\n\n**2. Energy of Interaction between Sphere Charges (`U_sphere-sphere`)**\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion energy. This is a well-known problem called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the proven minimum energy configuration is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs. For an icosahedron, these pairs can be categorized by their separation distance:\n*   30 pairs of nearest neighbors.\n*   30 pairs of next-nearest neighbors.\n*   6 pairs of antipodal charges (opposite each other on the sphere).\n\nThe total energy of this sub-system can be expressed as `U_sphere-sphere = E_12 * (k * (2e)^2 / R)`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless factor representing the sum of inverse distances for the icosahedral arrangement. Through geometric calculation, this factor is found to be:\n`E_12 = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ≈ 49.165`\n\n**Total System Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n`U_total = (48 * k * e^2 / R) + (E_12 * 4 * k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (48 + 4 * E_12) * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values for the constants:\n*   `e` (elementary charge) = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   `k` (Coulomb's constant) ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   `R` = 2 m\n*   `E_12` ≈ 49.165\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n*   `k * e^2 / R = (8.98755 × 10⁹ * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹)²) / 2 ≈ 1.15354 × 10⁻²⁸ J`\n*   `U_center-sphere = 48 * (1.15354 × 10⁻²⁸ J) ≈ 0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n*   `U_sphere-sphere = 4 * 49.165 * (1.15354 × 10⁻²⁸ J) ≈ 2.2686 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n`U_total ≈ 0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.2686 × 10⁻²⁶ J ≈ 2.8223 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding the result to three decimals gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<B>>>"
