    "The provided information points toward a specific type of astronomical observation. An absorption line with an energy of 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) corresponds to the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, a cornerstone of radio astronomy. The observation of a structure at a great distance (2.1 Gpc) means the detected light is redshifted; its original energy was higher. Taking this cosmological redshift into account, the rest-frame energy of the absorption line is approximately 5.8 µeV, which precisely matches the energy of the 21-cm hydrogen line.\n\nThis 21-cm line is produced by a transition in the ground state of neutral hydrogen atoms. In the vast expanse of the interstellar medium (ISM), this line can be observed in either emission or absorption.\n\nThe different states of the interstellar medium are characterized by their temperature and composition:\n*   **Molecular clouds** are the coldest and densest regions, with temperatures around 10-20 K. They are primarily composed of molecular hydrogen (H₂).\n*   The **atomic interstellar medium** is composed mainly of neutral hydrogen (HI) and is divided into two main phases.\n*   The **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM)** has temperatures of several thousand Kelvin (6,000-10,000 K). It is a significant source of 21-cm line *emission*.\n*   The **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM)** is characterized by much lower temperatures, typically between 50 and 100 K. This colder, denser atomic gas is what gives rise to strong 21-cm *absorption* lines when it lies in front of a brighter background radio source.\n\nSince the observation is of an absorption line, it is most indicative of the cold atomic component of the interstellar medium. The strength of the 21-cm absorption is inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas, making it an excellent tracer for the Cold Neutral Medium. Therefore, observing this absorption line within the Milky Way would most likely be probing the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
