    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   We are given m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\nT₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nT₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the correct relativistic formulas:**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment be 'p'.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (m c²)².\nSince E = T + mc², we have (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²)\n*   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nEquating these two expressions:\nT₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n\nWe also know that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603\n396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**5. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/(2m).\nSince the momenta are equal (p₁ = p₂ = p):\n*   p² = 2m₁T₁_classical\n*   p² = 2m₂T₂_classical\n\nTherefore:\n2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical\nm₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2T₁_classical\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the same:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3T₁_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\nThis is the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nDifference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
