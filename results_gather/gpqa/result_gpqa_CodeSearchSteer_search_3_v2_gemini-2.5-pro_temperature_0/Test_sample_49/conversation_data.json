    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `1/(4π)` in the mathematical expression for the diagram's size estimate. In four-dimensional spacetime, calculations in quantum field theory using dimensional regularization introduce a factor of `1/(4π)^2` for each loop.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIf we let `L` be the number of loops in the diagram, the total factor from the loop integrations would be `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`. By comparing this with the term in the expression, we can set up the following equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops. The other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the number of vertices and the specific particles involved, but the power of `1/(4π)` is the direct indicator of the loop number.\n\n<<<D>>>"
