    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the spherical conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from `+q` within the conductor material (a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor isolates the region outside from the electric fields originating from within the cavity. The arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` inside the conductor (on the cavity wall) produces no electric field outside the conductor. The location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity does not affect the distribution of charge on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will spread out uniformly. Because the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the charge distribution on its outer surface will be spherically symmetric, regardless of the shape or position of the cavity inside.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor, is determined solely by the charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
