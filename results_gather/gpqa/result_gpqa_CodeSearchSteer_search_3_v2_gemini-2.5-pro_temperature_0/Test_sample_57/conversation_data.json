    "Based on an analysis of the provided physical theories, Superstring Theory is the one that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory, QED requires regularization to handle the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that appear in calculations involving loop diagrams. These divergences correspond to high-energy phenomena. The process involves introducing a regulator, or \"cutoff,\" to make the calculations finite before applying renormalization to arrive at physical predictions.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong force. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in perturbative calculations that must be treated with regularization techniques, such as lattice regularization.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum field theory with loop diagrams, has its own divergence problem related to the self-energy of a point charge. Treating an electron as a point particle leads to an infinite energy in its own electric field, an issue at short distances (or high energies). This divergence suggests the theory is ill-defined at this level and requires some form of modification or \"regularization\" to be resolved.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is that it is believed to be a \"manifestly ultraviolet finite\" theory. Unlike point particles in quantum field theory, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional strings. This extended nature smooths out the short-distance interactions that cause UV divergences in other theories. Consequently, superstring theory is expected to be free of such divergences and does not require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
