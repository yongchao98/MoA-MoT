    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in *l***: The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: For a decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most probable transition ($3s \\rightarrow 2p$).\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, +1,$ or $-1$, which is true for all possible intermediate states.\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels of the $l'=1$ state. The three possible final states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1 (assuming the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is the only one considered). Since the probabilities are equal, the branching ratio for transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    The intermediate state is a $2p$ state. The only state with a lower principal quantum number that it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>"
