    "This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Identify the knowns:**\n*   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary reference frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt₀` is the proper time, measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta).\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n**4. Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula with the calculated Lorentz factor:\n\n`Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s = 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure 51.03 seconds.\n\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nFinally, to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame, we use the standard distance formula:\n\n`Distance = Velocity * Time`\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n`d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision to be certain.\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d = 60000 * (50 / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis result is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
