    "To determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spotted star and then equate it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its maximum brightness when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer and its minimum brightness when the hemisphere with dark spots is visible. The flux (F) of a star is related to its effective temperature (T) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is observed. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature (T_eff) raised to the fourth power.\n    F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is observed. This hemisphere has a 20% filling factor (f = 0.2) of dark spots. The spots have a temperature (T_spot) of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. The remaining 80% of the hemisphere is at the star's effective temperature (T_eff = 6000K). The total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve is the relative change in flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nBy substituting the expressions for flux, we get:\n\nAmplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = [f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the brightness of the star varies by approximately 10.36%.\n\n### 2. Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe signal produced by a transiting exoplanet is a dip in the star's brightness, known as the transit depth. This depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the relative radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude from the starspots.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n\nR_pl / R_star ≈ √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
