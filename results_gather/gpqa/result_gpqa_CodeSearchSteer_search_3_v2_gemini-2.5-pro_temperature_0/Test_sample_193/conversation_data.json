    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Here, β = 1/(kT), and the energy E is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nSince each of the three spins can take a value of +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system. We will calculate the energy for each of these states.\n\nThe states can be grouped by the number of spins pointing up (+1) and down (-1).\n\n**Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n*   **State 1:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E1 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E2 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states with an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are +1 and one spin is -1.**\n*   **State 3:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E3 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 4:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E4 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 5:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E5 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\n**Case 3: One spin is +1 and two spins are -1.**\n*   **State 6:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E6 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 7:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E7 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 8:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E8 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\nIn summary, we have two distinct energy levels:\n1.  Energy E_1 = -3J, with a degeneracy (number of states) g_1 = 2.\n2.  Energy E_2 = J, with a degeneracy g_2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g_1 * e^(-βE_1) + g_2 * e^(-βE_2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
