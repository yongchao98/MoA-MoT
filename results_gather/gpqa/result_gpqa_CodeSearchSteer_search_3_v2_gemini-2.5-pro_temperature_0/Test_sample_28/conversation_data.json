    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein's structure and function. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation early in the gene sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic sequence of the intact gene and each mutant. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, with each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's examine the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to completely eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence shows multiple single-base substitutions compared to the original, resulting in several amino acid changes (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Threonine to Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this will alter the protein, but complete loss of function is less certain than with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence also contains multiple **missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Glycine to Threonine). Like the other missense mutations, the effect is not as predictably severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence. This nonsense mutation will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
