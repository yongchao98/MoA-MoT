    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural energy width (also called linewidth) of each level. This requirement stems from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related. A common form of this relationship is ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This means a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy; there is an inherent \"smearing\" or width to its energy level.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width of Each State**: The lifetime (τ) of the state can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the minimum energy uncertainty, or the natural linewidth (ΔE), can be estimated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   **For the first state (E1)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2)**:\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution**: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the first state has a shorter lifetime, which results in a larger energy width (ΔE1 > ΔE2).\n    *   The condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare the given options with this condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is much larger than the natural linewidth of the broader state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
