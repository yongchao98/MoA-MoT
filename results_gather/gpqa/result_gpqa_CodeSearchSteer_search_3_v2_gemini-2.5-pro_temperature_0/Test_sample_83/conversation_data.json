    "The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations, using the described method, is the ability to decompose the fractional approximation of the matrix exponential. This decomposition allows the problem to be broken down into independent sub-problems that can be solved simultaneously on different processors.\n\nSpecifically, when a rational function is used to approximate the matrix exponential, a partial fraction expansion can be applied. This technique rewrites a single complex rational function as a sum of simpler fractional terms. In the context of the matrix equation, this means that the overall calculation is transformed into a series of independent linear systems. These independent systems can then be solved in parallel, which is the essence of converting the sequential process into a parallel one.\n\nOther factors mentioned are relevant to the overall numerical method but are not the key enabler of parallelization:\n*   **Nonlocal boundary conditions** generally complicate parallel processing due to increased data dependency across the domain.\n*   **Complex roots** of the fractional approximation may arise, but the partial fraction method can handle them; their existence is not what enables parallelism.\n*   **Stability analysis** is crucial for ensuring the numerical method is valid and produces a meaningful solution, but it does not, by itself, provide the mechanism for parallel implementation.\n\nTherefore, the linear partial fraction decomposition is the mathematical tool that directly facilitates the parallelization of the algorithm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
