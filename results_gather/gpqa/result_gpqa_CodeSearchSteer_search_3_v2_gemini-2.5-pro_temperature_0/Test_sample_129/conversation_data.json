    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds that can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The absorption of light by neutral hydrogen occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can effectively observe light at wavelengths longer than the atmospheric cutoff. This cutoff is not perfectly sharp, but observations become very difficult below about 3200-3500 Å. For practical purposes and efficient observations, the limit is often considered to be around 3500-4000 Å. Let's use a conservative and practical cutoff wavelength (λ_observed) of ~3600 Å for the lower limit of detection.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength of the light to the wavelength observed on Earth through the formula:\n    z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest.\n\n    To find the minimum redshift (z_min) required for the Lyman-alpha line to be observable from the ground, we set λ_observed to our atmospheric cutoff and λ_rest to the Lyman-alpha wavelength.\n\n    *   λ_observed ≈ 3600 Å\n    *   λ_rest ≈ 1216 Å\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    z_min = (3600 Å - 1216 Å) / 1216 Å\n    z_min = 2384 Å / 1216 Å\n    z_min ≈ 1.96\n\nThis calculated redshift is very close to 1.9. For the Lyman-alpha forest to be observable with ground-based telescopes, the absorption features need to be redshifted into the optical atmospheric window, which generally requires a redshift of z > 2.\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 1.2\nB) 2.4\nC) 1.9\nD) 3\n\nThe value of ~1.96 is closest to 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
