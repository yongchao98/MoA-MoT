    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is stereospecific and produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The opening of an epoxide ring with aqueous acid is an anti-addition. Water attacks the protonated epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are the same meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This reaction forms the cis-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The subsequent anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting material is achiral and the attacks are equally probable, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The racemic pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
