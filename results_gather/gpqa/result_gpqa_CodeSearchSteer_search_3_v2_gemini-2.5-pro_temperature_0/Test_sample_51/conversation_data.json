    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here given the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, N₂ and N₁, is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n\n**N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]**\n\nWhere:\n*   **N₂** and **N₁** are the number of atoms in the higher (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states, respectively.\n*   **g₂** and **g₁** are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two levels.\n*   **E₂ - E₁** (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Energy of the Transition\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ). The relationship is described by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n**ΔE = h * c / λ**\n\nWhere:\n*   **h** is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **c** is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   **λ** is the wavelength of the transition, given as 1448 Å (which is 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference ΔE:\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Ratios\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This is the ratio of the population ratio without spots (T_nospots = 6000 K) to the population ratio with spots (T_spots = 5500 K).\n\nLet's denote the population ratio (N₂/N₁) as *R*.\n\n*   **R_nospots** = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]\n*   **R_spots** = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n\nThe factor we are looking for is **Factor = R_nospots / R_spots**.\n\nFactor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 6000 K)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 5500 K)] }\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the exponent:\n\nExponent = [ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ] * [ (1/5500 K) - (1/6000 K) ]\nExponent ≈ 99421 K * [ (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ] K⁻¹\nExponent ≈ 99421 * [ 500 / 33,000,000 ]\nExponent ≈ 99421 * (1 / 66000)\nExponent ≈ 1.506\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of its surface covered by spots is not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
