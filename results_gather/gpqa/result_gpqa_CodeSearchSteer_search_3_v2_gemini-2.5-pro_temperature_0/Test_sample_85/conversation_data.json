    "The analysis of the two reactions relies on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃).\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, possesses both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. This creates a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification, known as lactonization, to form a stable six-membered ring lactone.\n\nThe stereocenter at the third carbon of the starting material becomes the stereocenter at the fourth carbon of the lactone product. Since the reduction and lactonization steps do not alter the configuration of this stereocenter, the configuration of starting material A must be the same as the product. Therefore, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) facilitates an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the lactone and the release of isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final lactone product. To yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
