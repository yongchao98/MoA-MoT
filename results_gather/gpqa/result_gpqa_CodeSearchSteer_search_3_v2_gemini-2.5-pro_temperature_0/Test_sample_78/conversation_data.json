    "### Analysis of the Product from NMR Data\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the reaction product from the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone.\n    *   Signals in the range of **δ 126.9-144.1 ppm** correspond to carbons in aromatic rings and C=C double bonds. The presence of two signals with an intensity of 2C each (`δ 126.9 (2C)` and `δ 129.1 (2C)`) strongly suggests a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to methyl (-CH₃) carbons.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The two doublets at **δ 7.71 (2H)** and **δ 7.08 (2H)** are classic indicators of protons on a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two doublets at **δ 7.68 (1H)** and **δ 6.75 (1H)** indicate two protons on a C=C double bond that are coupled to each other.\n    *   The two singlets at **δ 2.31 (3H)** and **δ 2.28 (3H)** correspond to two different methyl groups that have no adjacent protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  The data points to a *para*-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (¹H: δ 2.31, ¹³C: δ 21.3), forming a *p*-tolyl group.\n    2.  The other part of the molecule contains a ketone (¹³C: δ 197.7), a C=C double bond, and another methyl group (¹H: δ 2.28, ¹³C: δ 28.4).\n    3.  The most plausible structure that fits all the data is an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. This structure contains all the identified fragments in an arrangement consistent with the chemical shifts and coupling patterns.\n\n### Identification of Compound X\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We must determine which of the starting materials would yield this specific product.\n\n1.  **Examine the Starting Materials:** The product contains a *p*-tolyl group (a toluene ring substituted at the *para* position). For this group to be present in the product, it must also be present in the starting material, as the reaction conditions (DABCO, heat) do not facilitate the methylation of a benzene ring.\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The name indicates an oxirane ring substituted with a 4-methylstyryl group. The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains the necessary *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl group.\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This compound has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula for Compound X.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The only plausible starting material is **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a terminal vinyl epoxide. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n    *   The base, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), abstracts a proton from the terminal carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The resulting anion triggers the opening of the strained epoxide ring to form a stable enolate intermediate.\n    *   Protonation of the enolate and subsequent tautomerization yield the final α,β-unsaturated ketone product, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nThis type of rearrangement, known as the Meinwald rearrangement, is well-documented for vinyl epoxides under both acidic and basic conditions.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
