    "To determine the correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate for a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the higher energy state (b) and lower energy state (a), respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the two states (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited atoms (in state b) to atoms in the ground state (state a) for each star:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T_1):\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T_2):\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state is twice as large for star 1 compared to star 2:\n\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_b / g_a) is a property of the iron atom and cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis gives:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is defined as 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
