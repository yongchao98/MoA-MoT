    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. The mass fraction of carbon is therefore 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   To find the empirical formula, we can divide the mass percentages by the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n        *   For H: 14.28 / 1 = 14.28\n        *   For C: 85.72 / 12 = 7.14\n    *   The ratio of H to C atoms is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, which does not fit the CH₂ ratio. However, the general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ, which perfectly matches the empirical formula.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all chemical compounds present in both mixtures X and Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Upon the addition of hydrogen, they all convert to cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar (1:1 molar ratio) mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, disproportionation involves a hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture containing cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate dehydrogenation product of a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. This mixture fits the description: it's equimolar, its components have a C₆ skeleton, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (cyclohexane stays the same, benzene becomes cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products: 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Both A and B must be based on a six-carbon ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's consider the possible unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two fits the reaction. Let A = Cyclohexene and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n        *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n        *   This is a perfectly balanced reaction. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This type of catalytic hydrogen transfer is a known process.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
