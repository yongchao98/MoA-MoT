    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Volume and Star Density:** If we consider a sphere of radius *d* around the observer, its volume *V* is given by V = (4/3)πd³. With a uniform stellar density ρ (number of stars per unit volume), the total number of stars *N* within this distance *d* is N = ρ * V = ρ(4/3)πd³.\n\n2.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance *d* to the star. The relationship is given by d = 1/plx, where *d* is in parsecs and *plx* is in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** To find the number of stars in a specific parallax range, we consider a thin spherical shell at a distance *d* with a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell, *dV*, is the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness *dd*, so dV = 4πd²dd. The number of stars *dN* in this shell is dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd²dd.\n\n4.  **Expressing in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to express *dN* in terms of parallax. We substitute d = 1/plx into the equation. We also need to find the relationship between *dd* and *d(plx)*. By differentiating d = 1/plx, we get dd/d(plx) = -1/plx². The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, we consider the magnitude, so |dd| = (1/plx²)d(plx).\n\n5.  **Final Derivation:** Substituting d = 1/plx and |dd| = (1/plx²)d(plx) into the equation for *dN*:\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²)d(plx)\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴)d(plx)\n\n6.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx). From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is noted in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias, which arises from the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
