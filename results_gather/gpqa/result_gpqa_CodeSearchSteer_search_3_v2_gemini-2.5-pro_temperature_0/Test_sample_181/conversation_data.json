    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the ideal case of space-charge-limited current (SCLC). The validity of this equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism.\n\nA detailed analysis of these assumptions reveals the following:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes (unipolar transport).\n*   **Trap-Free:** The classic Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free solid. The presence of traps that capture charge carriers would alter the relationship between current and voltage, leading to a different equation (often the Mark-Helfrich equation).\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** A critical requirement for SCLC is that the electrode can freely inject charge carriers into the semiconductor. This type of non-rectifying contact is called an Ohmic contact, which has no energy barrier for charge injection. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would limit the injection and the current would be injection-limited, not space-charge-limited.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The Mott-Gurney law is derived assuming that the current is dominated by the drift of charge carriers in the applied electric field. The current component arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible. This is a valid approximation when the applied voltage is sufficiently high.\n\nBased on these points:\n*   **Statement A** correctly identifies all the key conditions: a trap-free, single-carrier device with no injection barrier (which implies an Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.\n*   **Statement B** is incorrect because a Schottky contact has an injection barrier, which violates a core assumption.\n*   **Statement C** is incorrect because the SCLC is a drift-dominated current; neglecting the drift current would mean neglecting the very phenomenon being described.\n*   **Statement D** is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law applies to single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
