  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, we must analyze the provided DNA sequence in the context of protein translation.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n5'-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAA...-3'\n\nLet's break down this sequence into three-nucleotide codons to see what amino acids they code for:\n\n1.  **ATG**: This is the universal start codon, which codes for Methionine (Met). Translation correctly initiates here.\n2.  **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC**: This sequence, `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, codes for the amino acid sequence Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). This is the correct and standard sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag. Therefore, the tag itself does not have a missense mutation.\n3.  **AAA**: This codon codes for the amino acid Lysine (Lys).\n4.  **TGA**: This is one of the three universal stop codons (along with TAA and TAG). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it does not code for an amino acid. Instead, release factors are recruited, and translation is terminated, releasing the nascent polypeptide chain.\n\nThe sequence contains a premature stop codon (`TGA`) immediately following the codons for the HA tag and a single lysine residue. This causes the ribosome to stop translation long before it can synthesize the full GADD45G protein. The result would be a tiny, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-tag-Lys), explaining the failure to detect the overexpression of the full-length protein.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is irrelevant. The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Furthermore, tRNAs are not supposed to exist for stop codons in the first place.\n*   **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. The presence of the TGA stop codon halts protein synthesis prematurely.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While a linker might be beneficial, the primary issue is that the full protein chain is never synthesized due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The sequence for the HA tag is correct. The mutation is located after the tag sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
