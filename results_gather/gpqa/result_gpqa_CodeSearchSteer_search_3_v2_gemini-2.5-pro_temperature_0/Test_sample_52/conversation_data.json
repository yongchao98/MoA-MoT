    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, particularly a para-substituted one where the two substituents are different.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for –CH2 groups is a critical constraint, eliminating many possible structures.\n    *   **Two –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The signals for a doublet and a doublet of quartets are characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl hydrogen, resulting in a doublet. The second vinyl hydrogen is split by the first vinyl hydrogen (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), which results in a doublet of quartets. The methyl group of this substituent would appear as a doublet, accounting for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **The second –CH3 group:** This methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH2 groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). This accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would appear as a singlet.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CHCH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the methyl ester group) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the benzene ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the structural features: 4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n\nComparing this calculated formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
