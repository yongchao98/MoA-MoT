    "The problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on a set of given astronomical data. The solution involves applying the principles of black body radiation and the Doppler effect.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Information from Wavelength**: According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest was the same. This implies the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal, which are affected by the stars' motion relative to the observer.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The radial velocity of a star causes a shift in the observed wavelength of its light. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em,₁). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing its light to be redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). The observed wavelength is given by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁\n    *   For Star_2: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Temperature Ratio Calculation**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we have:\n    λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Using Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using v₂ = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
