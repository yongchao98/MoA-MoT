    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**2. Count the Bonds**\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, one at the beginning and one at the end of the main chain. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can determine the number of C-C single bonds by analyzing the structure's connectivity.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connect the first carbon to two methyl groups.\n    *   There are four C-C single bonds within the main carbon chain.\n    *   One C-C bond connects a main-chain carbon to a methyl group.\n    *   Two C-C bonds connect the last carbon to two methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nUsing the provided bond energies:\n*   Energy to break 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy to break 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\nThis is the energy required to form the constituent atoms in their gaseous state from their elements in their standard state (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n*   Enthalpy to form 12 moles of gaseous Carbon = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ.\n*   Enthalpy to form 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H (100 kJ/mol) is for the reaction H2 → 2H. To get the enthalpy of formation for one mole of H atoms (½H2 → H), we take half of the bond energy.\n    *   ΔH_f(H, g) = 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    *   Enthalpy to form 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen = 22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Formation of Atoms = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound**\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated using the following relationship, based on Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\nThe options provided are in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.011 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166.3 g/mol) ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
