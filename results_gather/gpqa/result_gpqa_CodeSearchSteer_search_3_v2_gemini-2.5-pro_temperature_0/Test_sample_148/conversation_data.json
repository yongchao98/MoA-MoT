    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the potential explanations:\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct for one proton. This indicates the presence of two similar, yet chemically distinct, species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two species must be isomers.\n*   **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity, confirming the presence of two species in a 1:1 ratio. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the identical mass, which corresponds to the expected product. This rules out impurities like precursors or byproducts with a different molecular weight.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. The MS data, which shows the correct mass for both components, contradicts this explanation.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different mass. This is also contradicted by the MS data showing the correct mass for both peaks.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra; you would only see one set of peaks. Similarly, they cannot be separated by standard, achiral liquid chromatography. Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This situation arises when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the isomers differ at some, but not all, of these centers.\n    *   **Chemical Properties:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically different, diastereomers give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum, even in an achiral solvent. It is common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers to have slightly different chemical shifts.\n    *   **LC:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like HPLC.\n    *   **Peptide Synthesis:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks racemizes (converts to a mixture of D and L forms) during the coupling reaction, the final product will be a mixture of diastereomers. This is a known and common side reaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two sets of peaks in the NMR and two separable peaks of identical mass in the LC-MS is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is the only option that fits all the experimental evidence. The likely cause is the racemization of one of the amino acid's alpha-carbons during the chemical synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
