    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of $n$:\n*   **Ground state:** For $n=0$, the energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** For $n=1$, the energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** For $n=2$, the energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** For $n=3$, the energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a level $n$ is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the number of ways the integer $n=3$ can be expressed as the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$):\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\nThe total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
