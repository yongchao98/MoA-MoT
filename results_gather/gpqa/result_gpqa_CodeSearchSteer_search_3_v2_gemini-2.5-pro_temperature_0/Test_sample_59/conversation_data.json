    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take from the astronaut's perspective, we need to calculate the effects of time dilation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Distance to Earth\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel in Earth's Frame of Reference\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth. The spacecraft's speed is a constant 0.99999987 *c*.\n\n*   **Time = Distance / Speed**\n*   Time = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n*   Time ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nSo, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Dilation Factor (Lorentz Factor)\nNext, we use the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:\n\n*   **γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.00000026\n*   γ = 1 / 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n### 4. Time Experienced by the Astronaut\nNow, we can determine the time that passes for the astronaut (the proper time, τ) by dividing the time as measured from Earth by the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **τ = Time in Earth's frame / γ**\n*   τ = 163,000.02 years / 1961.16\n*   τ ≈ 83.11 years\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe journey to Earth would take approximately 83.11 years from the 22-year-old astronaut's point of view. Given that the astronaut's species has an average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut would be about 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years old upon arrival, which is well within their lifetime.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. (Incorrect)\nB) 81 years (Closest to our calculated value)\nC) 72 years (Incorrect)\nD) 77 years (Incorrect)\n\nThe calculated time of approximately 83 years is closest to 81 years. The slight difference can be attributed to rounding in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud or the precise speed of the spacecraft.\n\n<<<B>>>"
