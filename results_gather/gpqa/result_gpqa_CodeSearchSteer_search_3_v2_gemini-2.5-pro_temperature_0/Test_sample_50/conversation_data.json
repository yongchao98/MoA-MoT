    "The problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic application of the method of images in electrostatics.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Method of Images**: The electric field and potential outside the grounded sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is at zero potential. The image charge is positioned and sized such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Force**: The force on the real charge `q` is the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In the image method, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the force on the charge `q` when it is at the specific distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy (U) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is the integral of the force along the path.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Here, `x` is the variable distance from the center. The force as a function of `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Solving the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ (1/2) * du / u^2 = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/(∞^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative Explanation (Factor of 1/2)**: The potential energy of a charge `q` in an external potential `V` is `U = qV`. However, in this case, the potential from the induced charge is not independent of `q`; it is created by `q`. The work done in building up the charge from 0 to `q` at position `d` introduces a factor of 1/2. The potential at `d` due to the image charge is `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`. The total potential energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
