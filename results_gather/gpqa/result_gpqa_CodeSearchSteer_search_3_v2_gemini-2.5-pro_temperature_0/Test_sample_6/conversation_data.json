    "The user's question is a classic physics problem concerning the threshold energy for pair production from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n\n### 1. The Physical Process\n\nThe process in question is electron-positron pair production from the annihilation of two photons:\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-} $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is a high-energy gamma-ray, $\\gamma_{CMB}$ is a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background, and $e^{+}$ and $e^{-}$ are the resulting positron and electron.\n\n### 2. Threshold Energy Condition\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is the same as that of a positron. The rest mass energy of a single electron is $m_e c^2$. Therefore, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2 m_e c^2$.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation\n\nTo find the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray in our reference frame (the lab frame), we use relativistic kinematics. The square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it is the same in all inertial frames.\n\nLet:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $\\epsilon$ be the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   $m_e c^2$ be the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$) is lowest when the collision is head-on. In this case, the relationship between the energies and the electron rest mass at the threshold is given by the formula:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon} $$\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a well-known physical constant, approximately equal to 0.511 MeV.\n\nLet's convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n### 5. Converting to GeV\n\nThe final step is to convert this energy from electron-volts (eV) to giga-electron-volts (GeV).\nSince $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to option D. This energy threshold is a key reason why the universe is opaque to very high-energy gamma-rays over cosmological distances.\n\n<<<D>>>"
