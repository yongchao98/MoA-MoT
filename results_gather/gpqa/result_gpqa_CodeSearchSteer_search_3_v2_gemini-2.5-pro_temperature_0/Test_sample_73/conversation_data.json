    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential decay. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent probability of decaying in any future period.\n\n### 2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the formula P(survival) = e⁻ˡᵗ, where `λ` is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability of decay within time `t` is P(decay) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ.\n\nWe are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. We can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`.\n\n*   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n*   1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁰⁰⁾ = 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 1 - 0.32\n*   e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nBecause of the memoryless property, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes. We need to calculate P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾.\n\nWe can find the value of e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ from the value of e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ we found earlier:\n\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹·⁵\n*   e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (0.68)¹·⁵\n\nNow, we calculate the value of (0.68)¹·⁵:\n\n*   (0.68)¹·⁵ ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of decay:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607\n*   P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
