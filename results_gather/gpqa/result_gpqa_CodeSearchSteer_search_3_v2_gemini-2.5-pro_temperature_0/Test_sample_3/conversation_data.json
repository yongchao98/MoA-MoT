    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to describe their behavior.\n\nThe standard Maxwell's equations are based on the experimental observation that magnetic monopoles do not exist in our universe. This leads to the following key equations:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic \"charges\" or monopoles from which magnetic field lines can originate or terminate. If a magnetic monopole existed, it would act as a source or sink for the magnetic field, meaning the divergence of B would be non-zero, similar to how electric charges act as sources for the electric field. Therefore, this equation would have to change.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (related to the curl of E, or ∇×E). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" To maintain the symmetry between electricity and magnetism, this magnetic current would induce a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's Law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
