    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is based on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a probe interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction happens so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle. This is valid when the collision time is very short compared to the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus.\n\nThe key assumptions that jointly define this approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction involves only a single nucleon:** The incoming probe is assumed to interact with just one nucleon at a time. The total nuclear current is treated as a sum of these individual nucleon currents. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent to the interacting particles:** This assumption posits that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not have significant interactions with the other nucleons in the nucleus. In other words, the process is not distorted by so-called \"final-state interactions.\"\n\n3.  **Binding forces are negligible during the interaction:** The interaction is considered to be instantaneous. On this short timescale, the forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible. The nucleon is therefore treated as being \"free\" from the nuclear potential at the moment of the collision.\n\nThe assumption that the quarks internal to the nucleon are non-relativistic pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nucleus during a scattering event, which is the focus of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
