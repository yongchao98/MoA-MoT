    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet identical to Earth, which has a known average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This will serve as our baseline for comparison.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same basic composition, the more massive the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material, leading to a smaller radius than would be expected otherwise and a significantly higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is five times the mass of Earth but made of the same \"stuff\" will be considerably denser than Earth due to this gravitational compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with the same composition as Earth but less mass will have weaker gravity. This results in less gravitational compression, and therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four scenarios, the planet in option (c) will be the densest. Its substantial mass, five times that of Earth, creates immense internal pressure that compacts its material far more than in the other planets listed. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities very close to Earth's, while the planet in option (d) would be the least dense of the rocky planets described.\n\n<<<B>>>"
