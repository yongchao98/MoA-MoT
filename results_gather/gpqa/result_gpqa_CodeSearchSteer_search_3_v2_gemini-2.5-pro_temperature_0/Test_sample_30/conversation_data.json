    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho, para-directing group. The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, p-nitrotoluene is typically the major product. We will assume product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ in sulfuric acid is known to oxidize substituted toluenes to the corresponding benzaldehydes. Therefore, product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). The sodium hydroxide acts as a base to remove a proton from the α-carbon of acetone, forming an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone readily undergoes dehydration to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product, product 3, is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The E-configuration, where the larger groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, is the more stable and expected product.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\nThe structure of the molecule is:\n```\n      O\n      ||\nO₂N-Ph-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n```\nwhere Ph is a 1,4-phenylene group.\n\nDue to the extensive system of conjugated double bonds (phenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the molecule is largely planar.\n\nLet's examine the symmetry elements:\n*   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n*   **Proper Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes that leave the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n*   **Planes of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule is planar. Therefore, the plane containing the molecule is a plane of symmetry (σh). There are no other planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane perpendicular to the molecular plane).\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
