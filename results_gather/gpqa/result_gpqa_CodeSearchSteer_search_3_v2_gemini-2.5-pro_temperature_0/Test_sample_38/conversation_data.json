    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. According to the Born rule, the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a position x. Since the particle is certain to be found somewhere in the region where it can exist, the integral of this probability density over that entire region must be equal to 1.\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the normalization condition is:\n∫₁³ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability density, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex function of the form f = u + iv, the square of the magnitude is |f|² = u² + v². In this case, the real part is u = a / √(1 + x) and the imaginary part is v = -0.5.\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNow, we integrate this expression from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1:\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can solve this integral by splitting it into two parts:\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first part:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n\nEvaluating this from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + x)]₁³ = a² * ln(1 + 3) - a² * ln(1 + 1) = a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c), this simplifies to:\na² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nFor the second part:\n∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n\nEvaluating this from 1 to 3:\n[0.25 * x]₁³ = 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\nNow, we combine the results and set them equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNext, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na = √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
