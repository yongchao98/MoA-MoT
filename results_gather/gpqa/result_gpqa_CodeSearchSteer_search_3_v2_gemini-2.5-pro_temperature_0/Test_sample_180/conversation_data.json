    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify the Neutrino Sources\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n*   **The Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the dominant energy source in the Sun and has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III).\n    *   **pp-I and pp-II:** These branches produce low-energy `pp` neutrinos (up to ~420 keV) and a very distinct, sharp energy line of `⁷Be` neutrinos at 861 keV (and a smaller line at 384 keV).\n    *   **pp-III:** This branch is responsible for producing high-energy `⁸B` (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **The CNO Cycle:** This is a secondary set of reactions, catalyzed by Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen, that also fuses hydrogen into helium. It produces `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos with continuous energy spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### 2. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**. The key consequence of this is the complete disappearance of the `⁸B` neutrino flux. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band\nWe now examine the remaining neutrino sources in the two specified energy bands:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos are below this energy range.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos are not in this range (their main line is at 861 keV).\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos are now gone due to the pp-III branch stopping.\n    *   Therefore, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos).\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   This band contains the very strong, mono-energetic **`⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV**. This line is produced in the pp-II branch, which is still active.\n    *   The continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle also contributes a small background flux in this band.\n    *   The `⁸B` neutrino contribution is zero.\n\n### 4. Determine the Approximate Ratio\nThe problem asks for the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n*   The flux in Band 1 is now solely from the CNO cycle.\n*   The flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the intense `⁷Be` line, with a negligible contribution from the CNO background in comparison.\n\nTherefore, the ratio can be approximated as:\n\n**Ratio ≈ (Flux from CNO cycle) / (Flux from `⁷Be` neutrinos)**\n\nTo get an approximate value, we can compare the total fluxes from these two sources. The CNO cycle accounts for about 1% of the Sun's energy production, while the pp-chain accounts for 99%. The neutrino fluxes are related to the rates of these reactions.\n\n*   The total flux of all CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is approximately **0.7 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n*   The flux of the main `⁷Be` line is approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n\nThe ratio of the overall strength of these two sources is:\n\nRatio ≈ (Total CNO Flux) / (Total `⁷Be` Flux) ≈ (0.7 x 10⁹) / (5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.14\n\nThis value is very close to 0.1. The question asks for an approximate ratio, and the options are separated by orders of magnitude. This method of comparing the parent fluxes that contribute to each band provides the intended physical approximation.\n\nThus, the flux in Band 1 (powered by the CNO cycle) is about one-tenth of the flux in Band 2 (dominated by the `⁷Be` line from the pp-II branch).\n\n<<<A>>>"
