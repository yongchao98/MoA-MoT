    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds, we use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of each particle. The formula for the total relativistic energy of a single particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass (`m1`) = 2m\n*   Velocity (`v1`) = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy (`E1`):\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass (`m2`) = 3m\n*   Velocity (`v2`) = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy (`E2`):\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total ≈ 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
