    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds and then determine which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One singlet in the aromatic region (2H) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce two separate signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in three separate signals with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** Two singlets in the aromatic region (1H each) and three singlets in the aliphatic region (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in two signals.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One singlet in the aromatic region (2H) and two singlets in the aliphatic region (in a 6H:6H or 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- (methylene) protons and -CH3 (methyl) protons are different and will split each other.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One singlet in the aromatic region (4H), one quartet in the aliphatic region (4H from the two -CH2- groups), and one triplet in the aliphatic region (6H from the two -CH3- groups).\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (or fewer if there's overlap, but the ratios would be complex) and would also contain a quartet and a triplet from the diethylbenzene, which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-isomer gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-isomer gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H and two 1H) and five aliphatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H and two 1H) and four aliphatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed NMR data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
