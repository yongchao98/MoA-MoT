    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2 and the DoU is 5.\n*   The IR spectrum shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and an ethyl ester group at positions 1 and 4. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, and its methylene protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing at a much higher field (around 2.3 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, and its IR C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency. It would also show a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
