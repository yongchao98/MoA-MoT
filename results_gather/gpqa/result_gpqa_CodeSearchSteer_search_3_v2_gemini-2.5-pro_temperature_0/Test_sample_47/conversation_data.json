    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a ring-contracting rearrangement known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction yields a carboxylic acid with a smaller ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is one distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a second distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond axis (assuming rapid conformational averaging). This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and one is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two cis protons (on C2 and C5) form one set of equivalent hydrogens, and the two trans protons form another set. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2/C5 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2/C5 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3/C4 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3/C4 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n\nThis gives a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
