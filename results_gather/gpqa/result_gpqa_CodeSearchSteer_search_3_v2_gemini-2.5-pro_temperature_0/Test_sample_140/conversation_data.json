    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide base can abstract an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** The base can remove a hydrogen atom from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuterium atom due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium:** The base can remove the deuterium atom from C2. This elimination of DBr leads to the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion (NH2-) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from Path A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1. This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C2: The amino group attaches to C2. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Path B (via non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of this symmetrical intermediate results in the formation of a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible from this reaction:\n\n*   Aniline\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n\nThis makes a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
