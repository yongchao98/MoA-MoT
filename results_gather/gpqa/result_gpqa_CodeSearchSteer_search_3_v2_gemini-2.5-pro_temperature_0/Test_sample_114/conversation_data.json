    "The search results confirm the validity of the approach. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum. The relationship between a particle's energy, momentum, and rest mass is given by the relativistic kinematic relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². The search results also confirm that when there is a net initial momentum, the photons are not emitted at 180 degrees to each other. My step-by-step calculation correctly applies these principles. I have calculated the initial total energy and momentum, applied the conservation laws to the final state of two photons, and solved for the angle. The calculation is straightforward and the result is unambiguous. I am confident in my calculated answer.\n\n**Initial State:**\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Moves from the left (in the +x direction).\n    *   Rest mass = m_e\n    *   Energy (E_e) = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_e) is found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m_e * c²)²:\n        *   (p_e * c)² = E_e² - (m_e * c²)² = (4 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)² = 15 * (m_e * c²)²\n        *   p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e * c\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Moves from the right (in the -x direction).\n    *   Rest mass = m_e\n    *   Energy (E_p) = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_p) is found similarly:\n        *   (p_p * c)² = E_p² - (m_e * c²)² = (2 * m_e * c²)² - (m_e * c²)² = 3 * (m_e * c²)²\n        *   p_p = sqrt(3) * m_e * c\n\n**Conservation Laws:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c².\n    *   The final state consists of two photons of equal energy, E_γ.\n    *   The total final energy is E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2*E_γ.\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: 6*m_e*c² = 2*E_γ  =>  E_γ = 3*m_e*c².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely along the x-axis. Taking the +x direction as positive:\n        *   P_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c.\n    *   The final state has two photons. One moves at an angle θ to the x-axis, and the other at -θ (to conserve momentum in the y-direction).\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   The final momentum along the x-axis is P_final_x = (E_γ/c)*cos(θ) + (E_γ/c)*cos(θ) = 2*(E_γ/c)*cos(θ).\n    *   Equating the x-components of the initial and final momentum:\n        *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (E_γ/c) * cos(θ).\n\n**Calculating the Angle:**\n\n*   Substitute the value of E_γ into the momentum equation:\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * ((3*m_e*c²)/c) * cos(θ)\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n*   Solve for cos(θ):\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   Find θ:\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n*   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1 = 138.2 degrees.\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
