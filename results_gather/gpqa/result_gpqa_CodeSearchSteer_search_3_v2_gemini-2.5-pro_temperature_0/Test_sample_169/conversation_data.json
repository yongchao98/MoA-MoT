    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given unnormalized state is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ.\n    The corresponding bra is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n    The squared norm is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    The normalization constant is N = 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) [3i, 4]ᵀ.\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator S_y is related to the Pauli matrix σ_y by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y.\n    Given σ_y =\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n    ```\n    So, S_y = (ħ/2) *\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n    ```\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩.\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) *\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n    ```\n    * (1/5) *\n    ```\n    ( 3i )\n    (  4 )\n    ```\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-3i, 4] *\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i ) ( 3i )\n    ( i   0 ) (  4 )\n    ```\n    First, let's compute the matrix-vector product:\n    ```\n    ( 0  -i ) ( 3i )   ( (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) )   ( -4i )\n    ( i   0 ) (  4 ) = (  (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ) = ( 3i² ) = ( -3 )\n    ```\n    Now, substitute this back into the expression for ⟨S_y⟩:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/25) * [-3i, 4] *\n    ```\n    ( -4i )\n    (  -3 )\n    ```\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/25) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/25) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/25) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/25) * [-24]\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ/25\n\nLet's re-check the calculation.\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\nWe already calculated ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25.\nLet's calculate ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) *\n```\n( 0  -i ) ( 3i )\n( i   0 ) (  4 )\n```\n= (ħ/2) * [-3i, 4] *\n```\n( -4i )\n( -3  )\n```\n= (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n= (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n= (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n= (ħ/2) * [-24]\n= -12ħ\n\nSo, ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value -12ħ/25 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
