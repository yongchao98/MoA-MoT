    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes, and the change in mass of each tube tells us what gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of this tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which would form a precipitate. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe decomposition produced water, a non-reactive gas (C), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. The presence of nitrogen in many thermally unstable salts, along with the products, suggests the gases are related to nitrogen compounds.\n\n*   The most common non-reactive gas produced in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂). Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n*   The oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper (providing 0.05 mol of O atoms) and would likely produce N₂ as a byproduct is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   From this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would produce the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that formed CuO. This reaction would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂.\n*   The total amount of N₂ (Gas C) collected was 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ came from the reaction of N₂O with copper, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n\nSo, the gases formed by heating the salts were:\n*   **0.20 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, and N₂) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) yields nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) yields nitrogen gas and water: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's assume Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**. The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar (contained an equal number of moles of each salt). Let's verify if this matches our findings.\n\n*   Let 'x' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₃ produces x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of x moles of NH₄NO₂ produces x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x\n*   Moles of N₂ = x\n*   Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n\nFrom our analysis in step 2, we found:\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol   => x = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol  => 4x = 4(0.05) = 0.20 mol\n\nThe values are consistent. Therefore, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
