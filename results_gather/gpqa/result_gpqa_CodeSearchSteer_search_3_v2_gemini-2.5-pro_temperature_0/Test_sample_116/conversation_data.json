    "Here is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of atropisomer. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that result from hindered rotation around a single bond. In this biphenyl derivative, the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict the rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific conformation. If this conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism. The substitution pattern in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate leads to a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a stereocenter. The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, chiral conformation in a crystal lattice, in solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule is considered achiral on average. It does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
