    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (a ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, deprotonates the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The bulky nature of t-BuOK favors the formation of the kinetic enolate (from the less substituted α-carbon), but in this case, C6 is the only option.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate anion, with the nucleophilic charge on C6, attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   **Enolate (nucleophile):** The anion at C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   **Ethyl Acrylate (acceptor):** CH₂=CH−COOEt. The attack occurs at the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The initial ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) is added to the C6 position.\n    *   To name the final product, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   The ring is attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment (originally C6) is numbered as C1. This carbon has a methyl group. The carbonyl carbon (originally C1) is now at C2 (hence \"2-oxo\"). The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2) is now at C3.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (an α,β-unsaturated nitrile).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate Anion):** The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O. The nucleophilic attack occurs from the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Nitronate (nucleophile):** The anion at C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **But-2-enenitrile (acceptor):** CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The resulting structure after protonation by water is: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile functional group.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1): CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct combination of products is found in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
