    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, for two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state.\n\n### Analysis of the State\n\nThe system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n*   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons, corresponding to p-orbitals.\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n*   `m = -1` is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum, `L_z`, is the sum of the individual z-components, `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`. The state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the operator `L_z` with a corresponding eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n### Measurement and Conservation\n\nWhen a measurement of the individual components `L_1z` and `L_2z` is performed, the system collapses into a state where these quantities are well-defined. The eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` are `m_1ħ` and `m_2ħ`, respectively.\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the sum of the measured individual components must equal the total value for the system. Therefore, the measured quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must satisfy the condition:\n`m_1 + m_2 = m`\n\nIn this specific case, `m = -1`, so any measurement of `m_1` and `m_2` must result in `m_1 + m_2 = -1`.\n\n### The Question\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to the outcome:\n*   `m_1 = -1`\n*   `m_2 = -1`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf we check the sum of these desired outcomes, we get `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is `-1`. Because the measurement outcome `m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1` would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given state, this outcome is impossible.\n\nThe probability of an impossible event is zero. This can also be seen by expressing the coupled state `|2, -1>` in terms of the uncoupled basis states `|m_1, m_2>`. The expansion would only contain terms where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, a superposition of `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a component of the `|2, -1>` state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
