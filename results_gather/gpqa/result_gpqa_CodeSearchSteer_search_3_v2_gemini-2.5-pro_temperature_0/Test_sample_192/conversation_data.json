    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance.\n\n1.  **Define the given relationship:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx⁵. This describes the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which can be written as a distribution function `dN/d(plx)`.\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Define the target relationship:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance (r). This is the distribution function with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **State the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The relationship is given by:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n    From this, we can also express parallax in terms of distance:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to change variables:**\n    To convert the derivative from being with respect to parallax to being with respect to distance, we use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    Using the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we differentiate parallax with respect to distance:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r²`\n    When considering the density or number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this change, so we take the absolute value:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation:**\n    We substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the result for `|d(plx)/dr|`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the entire relationship in terms of distance (r):**\n    To get the final relationship, we replace the parallax term (`plx`) with its equivalent in terms of distance (`1/r`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance as r³.\n\n<<<A>>>"
