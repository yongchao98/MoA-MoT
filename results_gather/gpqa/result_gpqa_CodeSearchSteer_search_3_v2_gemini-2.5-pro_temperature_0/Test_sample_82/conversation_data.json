    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial Acetic Acid:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (HA).\n*   **Dilution:** The acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid:**\n    *   Initial moles of HA = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   New volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   New concentration of HA = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log(\\[A⁻]/\\[HA]).\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Determine the ratio of \\[A⁻]/\\[HA]:**\n    *   At this point, 25% of the acid is converted to A⁻ and 75% remains as HA.\n    *   The ratio \\[A⁻]/\\[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (A⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    *   Moles of HA = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Calculate the concentration of acetate (A⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n    *   Moles of A⁻ formed = 0.001 mol.\n    *   \\[A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   The reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kb = \\[HA]\\[OH⁻] / \\[A⁻].\n    *   Let x = \\[OH⁻] = \\[HA].\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48.\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
