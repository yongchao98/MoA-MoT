    "To determine the energies of the system, we must consider the properties of the particles and the potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are quantized. The energy for each level `n` (where `n` = 1, 2, 3, ...) is given by:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are specified as spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin state (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n*   **Ground State (Lowest Energy):**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy):**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level. The lowest energy excitation involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy):**\n    There are two possibilities for the next lowest excitation from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    2.  Promote a particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (this was the first excited state), and then promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n\n    Let's calculate the energy for the first possibility, which is the most likely candidate for the second excited state:\n    *   The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 1 × E₁ = E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy** = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n    Let's check other possibilities to be certain. For instance, moving one particle from n=2 to n=4 would result in a total energy of 2E (from n=1) + 4E (from n=2) + 16E (from n=4) = 22E, which is higher. Moving both particles from n=2 to n=3 gives 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E, also higher. Therefore, 18E is the correct energy for the second excited state.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
