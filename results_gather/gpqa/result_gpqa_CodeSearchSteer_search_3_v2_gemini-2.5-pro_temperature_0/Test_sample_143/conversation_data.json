    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to follow a few steps in physics. First, we calculate the particle's lifetime from its decay width. Then, we determine its velocity and Lorentz factor from its energy and mass. Finally, we combine these to find the mean distance it travels before decaying.\n\n### 1. Calculating the Lifetime (τ)\nThe lifetime of a particle (τ) is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and is given by the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nHere, ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s or 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n### 2. Calculating the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) accounts for the effects of special relativity, such as time dilation. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Rest mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\nCalculation:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV\nγ = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n### 3. Calculating the Velocity (v)\nThe particle's velocity (v) is related to its Lorentz factor. We often use β (beta), which is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (v/c).\n\nThe relationship is:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\nCalculation:\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\nβ ≈ 0.9887\n\n### 4. Calculating the Mean Decay Distance (d)\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before it decays. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance is this dilated lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity.\n\nThe formula is:\nd = v * γ * τ = β * c * γ * τ\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\nCalculation:\nd ≈ 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (20/3) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nA more precise calculation:\nd = (√(391)/20) * (299792458 m/s) * (20/3) * (2.0569 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
