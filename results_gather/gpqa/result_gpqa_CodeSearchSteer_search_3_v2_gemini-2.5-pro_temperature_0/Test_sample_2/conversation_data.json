    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we need to calculate ⟨ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x) |ψ⟩. This can be broken down into 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn matrix notation, the spin states are:\n|↑⟩ =\n|↓⟩ =\n\nSo, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5 + (√3)/2 = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe corresponding bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose:\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices are defined as:\nσ_z = [, [0, -1]]\nσ_x = [,]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expectation value of σ_z, which is ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σ_x, which is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [,] * [0.5, √3/2]\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the total expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
