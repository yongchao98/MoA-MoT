    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we first need to calculate the total mass of each binary system. The mass of a double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the stars' radial velocities and the orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) through Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the spectral lines of both stars are visible, the relationship is given by:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nHere, 'G' is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. A crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination 'i' is approximately 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, which simplifies the formula significantly to:\n\nM_total = [P * (K_total)³] / (2πG)\n\nwhere K_total = K₁ + K₂.\n\n### Calculating the Mass Ratio\nWe need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total2).\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = { [P₁ * (K_total1)³] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K_total2)³] / (2πG) }\n\nThe constant term (2πG) cancels out, leaving a straightforward ratio:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total1 / K_total2)³\n\n### Applying the Given Data\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the ratio formula:\n\n*   **Period Ratio (P₁ / P₂):** 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K_total1 / K_total2):** 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nPlugging these ratios back into the mass ratio equation:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 2 * 0.216\nM_total1 / M_total2 = 0.432\n\nThis result indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
