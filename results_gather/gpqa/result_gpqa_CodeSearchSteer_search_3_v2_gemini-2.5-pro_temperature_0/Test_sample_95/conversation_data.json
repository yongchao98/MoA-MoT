    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we can use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The necessary steps involve calculating the black hole's size from the provided astronomical data and then applying the physical formula for entropy.\n\n### 1. Determine the Size of the Event Horizon\n\nThe physical size of the event horizon can be determined from its angular size and the distance to the galaxy. The diameter of the event horizon (which is twice the Schwarzschild radius, 2R_s) is related to the angular size (θ) and the distance (d) by the small-angle approximation.\n\nThe formula is:\n`Diameter = d * θ`\n\nFirst, we must convert the given values into standard units:\n*   **Distance (d):** 10¹⁰ parsecs.\n    *   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *   d = 10¹⁰ * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m.\n*   **Angular size (θ):** 10⁻¹⁷ degrees.\n    *   The angle must be in radians for the formula: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180).\n    *   θ = 10⁻¹⁷ * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s):\n*   2R_s = d * θ\n*   R_s = (d * θ) / 2\n*   R_s = (3.086 x 10²⁶ m * 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹) / 2 ≈ 2.69 x 10⁷ m.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Event Horizon Area\n\nThe area of the event horizon (A) for a Schwarzschild black hole is given by the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n*   A = 4 * π * R_s²\n*   A = 4 * π * (2.69 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.09 x 10¹⁵ m².\n\n### 3. Calculate the Black Hole's Entropy\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. This formula connects the event horizon's area to its entropy through fundamental constants.\n\nThe formula is:\n`S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p²)`\nWhere:\n*   **k_B** is the Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   **A** is the event horizon area we calculated ≈ 9.09 x 10¹⁵ m².\n*   **l_p** is the Planck length ≈ 1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m.\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the Planck length:\n*   l_p² = (1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m)² ≈ 2.61 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m².\n\nNow, substitute all the values into the entropy formula:\n*   S = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.09 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2.61 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n*   S ≈ (1.254 x 10⁻⁷ J·m²/K) / (1.044 x 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\n*   S ≈ 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K.\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.2 x 10⁶² J/K. Comparing this to the given options, the order of magnitude is 10⁶².\n\n<<<D>>>"
