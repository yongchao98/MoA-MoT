    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n### **Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene heated with maleic anhydride**\n\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in a non-planar tub conformation. For it to participate in a Diels-Alder reaction, it must be in a planar form, which is energetically unfavorable. However, COT is in equilibrium with a small amount of its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring fused to a cyclobutene ring and is highly reactive as a diene.\n\nThe reaction with maleic anhydride is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Maleic anhydride, a potent dienophile, reacts with the 1,3-cyclohexadiene part of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. The reaction is kinetically controlled and follows the *endo* rule, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are positioned under the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This results in the formation of Product 1, the *endo* adduct. This adduct is a tetracyclic compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 heated with methanol and sulfuric acid**\n\nThis step involves the acid-catalyzed esterification of the anhydride in Product 1. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, and methanol acts as the nucleophile. The anhydride ring is opened by methanol, and subsequently, the resulting carboxylic acid is also esterified to form a dimethyl ester. This reaction does not alter the stereochemistry of the polycyclic framework. Therefore, Product 2 is the dimethyl ester corresponding to Product 1, with the two methoxycarbonyl groups maintaining the *cis* and *endo* relationship.\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 heated with cyclopentadiene**\n\nThis is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Product 2 contains a reactive double bond within its cyclobutene ring, which now acts as the dienophile. Cyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of this reaction is determined by the steric hindrance of Product 2. The cyclopentadiene will approach the cyclobutene double bond from the less sterically hindered face. The bulkiest part of Product 2 is the bicyclic system containing the two *endo* ester groups. Consequently, the cyclopentadiene will add to the face *opposite* this bulky group. This is known as an *exo* attack relative to the main bicyclic framework of Product 2.\n\nThis specific type of Diels-Alder reaction, involving a cyclobutene-1,2-dicarboxylate and cyclopentadiene, generally favors the formation of the adduct where the electron-withdrawing groups are in the *exo* position relative to the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system to minimize steric repulsion. However, in the context of the overall polycyclic structure, the approach of the cyclopentadiene is from the face *anti* to the existing ester groups, leading to a specific overall stereochemistry for the final product, Product 3.\n\n### **Determining the Final Structure**\n\nBased on the stereochemical controls of the two successive Diels-Alder reactions:\n1.  The first Diels-Alder reaction is *endo*-selective.\n2.  The second Diels-Alder reaction proceeds via an approach that minimizes steric hindrance, with the cyclopentadiene adding *anti* to the bulky ester groups.\n\nAnalyzing the provided options, the structure that correctly reflects this sequence of stereoselective reactions is C. The name and SMILES string for option C correspond to the major isomer formed.\n\n*   **Product 1:** *endo*-adduct of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and maleic anhydride.\n*   **Product 2:** *cis*-dimethyl ester with retained *endo* stereochemistry.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclopentadiene adds *anti* to the ester groups.\n\nThis leads to the specific isomer described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
