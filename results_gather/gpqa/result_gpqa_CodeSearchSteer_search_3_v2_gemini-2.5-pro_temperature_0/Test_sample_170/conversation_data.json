    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we need to consider the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe substituents can be classified based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups (deactivating):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-director. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a deactivating, meta-director.\n\n    Among these three, the nitro group is one of the strongest meta-directors, leading to a very low para yield. The ester and carboxylic acid groups are also strongly meta-directing. For nitration of a benzoic ester, the para yield is about 5%. For the bromination of nitrobenzene, the reaction requires harsh conditions and yields predominantly the meta isomer. The para yield for all three will be very low, with nitrobenzene expected to be the lowest. Following nitrobenzene, the ester and carboxylic acid groups will also have very low para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce significantly higher yields of the para-isomer compared to meta-directors.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Due to its small size, it allows for a significant amount of ortho substitution, but the para isomer is also a major product.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, but ortho, para-director. Halogens generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer, often more so than simple alkyl groups, due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yields (Meta-directors):** The lowest yields of the para-isomer will come from the meta-directing groups. The order among them, from lowest to highest para yield, is generally based on the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing nature.\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) is extremely deactivating and gives a negligible para yield.\n    *   Ethyl benzoate (2) and Benzoic acid (6) are also strongly deactivating. Data for the nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a 5% para yield. The deactivating strength of -COOH and -COOR are comparable.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the lowest para yields is: **4 < 2 ≈ 6**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yields (Ortho, para-directors):** Now we order the o,p-directors.\n    *   Comparing toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the bulkier ethyl group in (5) sterically hinders the ortho positions more than the methyl group in (1). This results in a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing the alkylbenzenes to chlorobenzene (3), halogens are known to give high para-to-ortho ratios. The nitration of chlorobenzene, for instance, yields 70% para-product, while the nitration of toluene yields 37% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have a higher para-isomer yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order for the highest para yields is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Groups:** Combining the two groups, we need to place the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors. The question asks for an increasing order of the *weight fraction* of the para-isomer. Based on typical isomer distributions, there is a significant gap between the para yield from meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.\n\nThe final combined order is determined by arranging the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors, each subgroup ordered by increasing para yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para yield):** 4 (-NO2) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 6 (-COOH). The relative order of 2 and 6 can be debated without precise data for bromination, but they are very close and both are significantly lower than the o,p-directors. Let's check the options. Option C suggests 4 < 2 < 6. Option D suggests 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the meta-directors. The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator. Between -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating strengths are similar. Let's look at the provided options to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4 (Decreasing order)\n*   B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 (Incorrect grouping)\n*   C) 4<2<6<3<1<5 (Incorrect order for o,p directors)\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3 (Correct grouping and plausible internal order)\n\nLet's analyze option D: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **Meta-directors:** 4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5). This order is plausible for the very low para yields.\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl). This order is consistent with our analysis based on steric hindrance and the known high para-selectivity for halogens.\n\nThe order presented in option D aligns well with established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The meta-directors produce the least para-isomer, with the strongly deactivating nitro group producing the absolute least. The ortho, para-directors produce the most, with the yield increasing as ortho-attack is sterically disfavored (-CH3 < -C2H5) and with the electronically favored para-direction of halogens (-Cl being the highest).\n\n<<<D>>>"
