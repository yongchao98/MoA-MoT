    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a phenomenon where a single chemical compound tends to exist in two or more interconvertible structures that are different in terms of the relative position of one atomic nucleus, which is generally hydrogen. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a compound must have an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists in a tautomeric equilibrium with its highly stable enol form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis* isomer).\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
