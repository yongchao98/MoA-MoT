    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each phosphate salt.**\n    *   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol. The moles of KH₂PO₄ are calculated as:\n        Moles KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   The molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O are calculated as:\n        Moles Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻). Its concentration is:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). Its concentration is:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    *   The solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    *   The hydrogen ion concentration can be found using the Ka₂ expression:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.109x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the HPO₄²⁻ ion.\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    *   The concentration of PO₄³⁻ can be found using the Ka₃ expression:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109x10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
