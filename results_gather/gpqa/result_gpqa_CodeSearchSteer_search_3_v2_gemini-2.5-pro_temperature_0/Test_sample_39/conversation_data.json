    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab. It refers to the inability to separate two or more compounds using chromatography.\n\nIn synthetic organic chemistry, a primary task after running a reaction is to purify the desired product from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and other impurities. The most common purification technique is chromatography (either thin-layer chromatography for analysis or column chromatography for purification).\n\nThis technique separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (a solid adsorbent, like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This partitioning is governed by the polarity of the molecules.\n\n*   **Stationary Phase:** Typically, a polar material like silica gel is used.\n*   **Mobile Phase:** A less polar organic solvent flows past the stationary phase.\n*   **Separation:** Polar compounds in the mixture will adhere more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move slowly. Less polar compounds will be more soluble in the mobile phase and will be carried along with it more quickly.\n\nWhen a chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means that the compounds in their mixture have very similar polarities. Because of this, they move through the chromatography plate or column at nearly the same rate, resulting in poor or no separation. Visually, on a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate, this would appear as a single, elongated spot or as spots that have not resolved from one another.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
