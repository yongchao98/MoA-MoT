    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relating Doppler Shift to Semi-Major Axis**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. This allows us to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star).\n\nThe relationship between the maximum Doppler shift and the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n\nK_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\nK_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a). Since the planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1). The formula is:\n\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_star1²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_star2²) / (M_p1² / K_star1²)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Ratio K_star1 / K_star2 = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
