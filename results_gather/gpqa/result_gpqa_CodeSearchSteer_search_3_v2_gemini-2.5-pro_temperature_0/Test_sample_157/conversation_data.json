    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. This is particularly common in proteins that must form dimers or larger complexes to be active, such as the transcription factor described.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario and options:\n*   **Wild-Type (Normal) Function:** Two normal protein subunits form a functional dimer, which then carries out gene transcription.\n*   **Recessive Mutation (X):** A subunit with mutation X is non-functional. In a heterozygote (one normal allele, one X allele), the normal subunits can still form functional dimers with each other, so function is maintained. A loss of function only occurs when both alleles are mutated (X/X).\n*   **Dominant-Negative Mutation (Y):** The mutation is in the dimerization domain. The mutant Y protein is non-functional. Crucially, it can still dimerize with wild-type (WT) proteins, forming a non-functional WT-Y heterodimer. This \"poisons\" the pool of WT proteins, preventing them from forming functional WT-WT dimers and thus blocking the normal cellular process. This interference with the normal protein is what makes the mutation's effect dominant.\n\nAnalyzing the options based on this mechanism:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss of function at the phenotypic level, not a gain of function.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can be a consequence of some mutations and does lead to a loss of function, it is not the most precise description. The defining feature of a dominant-negative mutation is the *interference* with the wild-type protein, which is more specific than just aggregation.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely phenotype. The phrase \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" perfectly describes the genetic outcome of a dominant-negative mutationâ€”the function from the normal allele is blocked. A very common molecular mechanism for this is that the non-functional heterodimer (mutant + wild-type) is recognized as faulty by the cell's quality control machinery and is targeted for degradation by the proteasome. This degradation removes both the mutant and the wild-type protein from the cell, leading to a loss of function.\n*   **D) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutation prevented dimerization altogether, the mutant protein would be inert, and the wild-type proteins would be free to form functional dimers, resulting in a wild-type phenotype (making it a recessive, not dominant, mutation). The premise is that the mutation is dominant-negative, meaning it must interfere with the wild-type protein, which typically requires interaction.\n\nTherefore, the formation of faulty dimers that are subsequently degraded, leading to the functional loss of the wild-type protein, is the most accurate description.\n\n<<<C>>>"
