    "The search results confirm the standard physics principles I used. Specifically:\n\n*   The probability of a particle surviving for a time `t` is given by an exponential decay law.\n*   The lifetime of a moving particle is subject to time dilation, where the lifetime in the lab frame (`T` or `Δt`) is the proper lifetime (`T₀` or `Δt₀`) multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ. The formula is `T = γT₀`.\n*   The survival probability `P(t)` can be written as `exp(-t / (γτ))`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame.\n*   This principle is famously demonstrated by the detection of cosmic-ray muons at the Earth's surface, which would not be possible in such large numbers without the effect of time dilation.\n\nThe problem is a direct application of these confirmed principles. My derivation and calculation are consistent with the physics described in the search results.\n\n**Problem Analysis**\n\n1.  **Fraction of surviving particles (f):** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial number `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`. The fraction is `f = N(t)/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n2.  **Time of flight (t):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  **Lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory is increased by the Lorentz factor `γ`. If the proper lifetime (in the particle's own rest frame) is `τ₀`, then the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting these into the fraction equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's set up the equations for the two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector setup.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction `f₁` = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction `f₂` = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂` = ?\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for `γ₂` by setting the expressions for the constant term `R / (c * τ₀)` equal:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
