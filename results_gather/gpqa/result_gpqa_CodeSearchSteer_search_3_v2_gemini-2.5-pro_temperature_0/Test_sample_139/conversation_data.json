    "Based on the chemical puzzle provided, the following substances have been identified:\n\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to the very common lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). It contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each atom, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, matching the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Lithium aluminum deuteride reacts violently with water (or heavy water) to produce a precipitate of aluminum hydroxide (or deuteroxide).\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O). The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide yields alumina and water. Similarly, aluminum deuteroxide yields alumina and heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given 277 K. For comparison, normal water freezes at 273.15 K.\n\nThe reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (Substance X) would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, resulting in a hydroxy acid which still contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with the clue.\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H) (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Calculate the mass of the lightest element's atoms:** Substance X contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n    *   Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n4.  **Calculate the mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** Substance X contains one atom of aluminum. The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n5.  **Calculate the cumulative mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    *   8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
