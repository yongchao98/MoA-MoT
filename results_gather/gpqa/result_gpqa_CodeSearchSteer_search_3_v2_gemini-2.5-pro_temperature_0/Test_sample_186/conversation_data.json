    "### Summary of Information\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information gathered to determine the detectability of the listed stars with the ESPRESSO spectrograph:\n\n**Observatory and Instrument:**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, its geographical coordinates are approximately 24.6° South latitude and 70.4° West longitude.\n*   **ESPRESSO Spectrograph:** An ultra-stable, high-resolution spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). It can be used with a single 8.2m Unit Telescope (UT) or with all four UTs combined. For this problem, we consider it coupled with one 8m VLT.\n\n**Detectability Criterion:**\n\n*   A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n\n**ESPRESSO Performance:**\n\n*   In the High-Resolution (HR) mode with a single UT, ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of 10 in a 20-minute exposure for a star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 16.3.\n*   Another source indicates that for the HR mode, a V magnitude of ~16 is the transition point where detector noise starts to dominate over photon noise.\n*   A performance chart shows that for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure in single HR mode, a S/N of 10 is achieved for stars much fainter than V=16. Specifically, a 20-minute exposure on a V=16.3 star yields S/N=10. Since S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, a 1-hour exposure would yield an even higher S/N for a V=16.3 star. Therefore, we can conservatively take V=16.3 as a detectable magnitude for a much shorter exposure, implying that stars with m_V ≤ 16.3 are certainly detectable in one hour. A separate document states that in the 4-UT mode, an S/N of 10 is reached for a V=19.4 star in a 1-hour exposure. While this is for the combined power of four telescopes, it gives an idea of the instrument's capability. For a single UT, a V magnitude of around 17 is considered the limiting magnitude. Based on the available data, a conservative limiting magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour with a single UT is at least V=16.3.\n\n**Star Properties and Calculations:**\n\nTo assess detectability, we need the apparent V magnitude (m_V) of each star and its declination (DEC) to confirm it is visible from Paranal. A star is generally visible if its declination is greater than approximately -65° (Latitude of Paranal - 90° + atmospheric buffer).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): -0.74.\n    *   Declination (DEC): Approximately -52° 41'.\n    *   **Visibility:** The declination of -52° 41' is well within the observable range from Paranal's latitude of -24.6°.\n    *   **Detectability:** With an m_V of -0.74, Canopus is exceptionally bright and therefore easily detectable.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): Fluctuates around 1.98.\n    *   Declination (DEC): Approximately +89° 15'.\n    *   **Visibility:** With a declination of +89° 15', Polaris is very close to the North Celestial Pole and is not visible from Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n*   **c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V=15, d=10 pc:**\n    *   Declination (DEC): 0°. This is visible from Paranal.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): Using the formula m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10), we get m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.\n    *   **Detectability:** An m_V of 15 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of V≈16.3, so this star is detectable.\n\n*   **d) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V=15, d=200 pc:**\n    *   Declination (DEC): 0°. This is visible from Paranal.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5.\n    *   **Detectability:** An m_V of 21.5 is much fainter than the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO with a single UT, so this star is not detectable.\n\n*   **e) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V=15, d=5 pc:**\n    *   Declination (DEC): 0°. This is visible from Paranal.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.5.\n    *   **Detectability:** An m_V of 13.5 is significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude, making it easily detectable.\n\n*   **f) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V=15, d=50 pc:**\n    *   Declination (DEC): 0°. This is visible from Paranal.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V): m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.5.\n    *   **Detectability:** An m_V of 18.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude for a single UT, so this star is not detectable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following stars would be detectable:\n1.  **Canopus:** Visible and very bright (m_V = -0.74).\n2.  **Star (c):** Visible and within the magnitude limit (m_V = 15).\n3.  **Star (e):** Visible and well within the magnitude limit (m_V = 13.5).\n\nPolaris is not visible from Paranal. The stars described in (d) and (f) are too faint to be detected by a single VLT unit with ESPRESSO under the specified conditions.\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
