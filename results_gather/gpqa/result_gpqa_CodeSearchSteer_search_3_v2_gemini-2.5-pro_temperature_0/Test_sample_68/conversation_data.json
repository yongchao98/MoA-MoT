    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   Total energy E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV/cÂ², which means the rest energy $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The distance it travels is its speed multiplied by this dilated lifetime. For highly relativistic particles, the speed is very close to the speed of light (c).\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The mean decay length is $L \\approx c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n        $L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum resolution**: The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $\\Delta x$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $\\Delta x$ before decaying is given by $e^{-\\Delta x / L}$.\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we set this fraction to 0.30.\n    *   $e^{-\\Delta x / L} = 0.30$\n    *   To solve for $\\Delta x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1.204 \\times L$\n    *   $\\Delta x \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Select the closest answer**: The calculated value is approximately $2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n    Option A is the closest in both numerical value and order of magnitude. The small discrepancy (about 10%) is likely due to a slight inconsistency in the problem's given values and the options, a common occurrence in physics problems.\n\n<<<A>>>"
