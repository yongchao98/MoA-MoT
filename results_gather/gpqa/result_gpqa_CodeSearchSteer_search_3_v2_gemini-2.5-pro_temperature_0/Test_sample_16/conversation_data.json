    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n### 1. Understand the Equilibrium\n\nThe Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). The reaction for the dissociation is:\n\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex:\n\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n### 2. Set Up the Calculation\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Reaction:** [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   **Initial (I):** 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M\n*   **Change (C):** -x | +x | +x\n*   **Equilibrium (E):** 0.02 - x | x | x\n\n### 3. Use the Equilibrium Constant\n\nThe dissociation constant (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f):\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n### 4. Simplify and Solve for x\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount of dissociation (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies that we should use the absolute formation constant without needing to correct for pH effects on the EDTA species.\n\n<<<D>>>"
