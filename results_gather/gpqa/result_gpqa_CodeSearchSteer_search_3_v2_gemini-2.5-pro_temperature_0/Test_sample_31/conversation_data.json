    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identification of the Nucleus\n\nThe problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number of Lithium (number of protons) is 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n### 2. Rest Mass of the Nucleus\n\nFrom the search results, the atomic mass of Lithium-6 ($^6$Li) is 6.015122 amu. It's important to use the mass of the specific isotope, not the average atomic mass of lithium.\n\n### 3. Conversion of Mass to Energy (Rest Energy)\n\nThe next step is to convert the atomic mass unit (amu) to Giga-electronvolts (GeV).\n*   The conversion factor is 1 amu = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n*   Rest mass ($m_0$) of $^6$Li = 6.015122 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/c²/amu\n    $m_0$ ≈ 5.60304 GeV/c²\n*   The rest energy ($E_0$) is therefore $m_0c^2$.\n    $E_0$ ≈ 5.60304 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nThe nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as follows:\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n*   $\\gamma$ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 5. Calculation of the Total Energy\n\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n*   $E = \\gamma E_0$\n*   $E$ ≈ 3.5714 * 5.60304 GeV\n*   $E$ ≈ 20.0105 GeV\n\nRounding to the precision requested (1e-4), we get 20.0105 GeV. This value is closest to option A. Let's re-calculate with higher precision to be certain.\n\n*   Mass of $^6$Li: 6.01512289 u\n*   Conversion: 1 u = 0.9314941 GeV/c²\n*   Rest Energy ($E_0$) = 6.01512289 * 0.9314941 = 5.603043 GeV\n*   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857\n*   Total Energy (E) = 3.57142857 * 5.603043 GeV = 20.01086 GeV\n\nThis result is very close to 20.132 GeV. Let's re-examine the provided options and my calculations. It's possible there's a slight variation in the constants used or the premise of the question. However, based on standard physical constants, 20.011 GeV is the calculated energy. Option A is the closest.\n\nLet's assume the energy in option A (20.132 GeV) is correct and work backward to see what rest mass would be required.\n*   Required Rest Energy ($E_0$) = Total Energy / $\\gamma$ = 20.132 GeV / 3.57142857 ≈ 5.6370 GeV\n*   Required Mass = 5.6370 GeV / 0.9314941 GeV/u ≈ 6.0515 amu.\n\nThis is slightly different from the known mass of Li-6. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of \"Energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\". This usually refers to the energy per nucleon pair. Let's calculate the energy per nucleon.\n\n*   Total Energy = 20.01086 GeV\n*   Number of nucleons (A) = 6\n*   Energy per nucleon = 20.01086 GeV / 6 = 3.335 GeV/nucleon\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options. The question asks for the total energy of the nucleus.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation, ensuring maximum precision.\n*   $m_0$ = 6.01512289 amu\n*   $E_0$ = 6.01512289 * 931.4941 MeV = 5603.043 MeV = 5.603043 GeV\n*   $v/c = 0.96$\n*   $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.0784} = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...$\n*   $E = \\gamma E_0 = 3.57142857 * 5.603043 \\text{ GeV} = 20.01086... \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe calculated value is consistently around 20.011 GeV. The closest option is A, 20.132 GeV. The discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for physical constants or a simplification in the problem's premise. Given the choices, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer, despite the minor calculation difference.\n\nLet's assume the mass of a proton and neutron are added up, instead of using the precise mass of the isotope which accounts for binding energy.\n*   Mass of proton ≈ 1.007276 amu\n*   Mass of neutron ≈ 1.008665 amu\n*   Mass of 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 3 * 1.007276 + 3 * 1.008665 = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 amu\n*   Rest Energy ($E_0$) = 6.047823 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/amu ≈ 5.6334 GeV\n*   Total Energy (E) = 3.57142857 * 5.6334 GeV ≈ 20.119 GeV\n\nThis value (20.119 GeV) is extremely close to option A (20.132 GeV). The small remaining difference can be attributed to the precision of the proton/neutron mass values used. This approach seems to be what the question intended.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Rest mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons separately: $m_{p} \\approx 938.272 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$, $m_{n} \\approx 939.565 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$\n*   $E_0 = (3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565) \\text{ MeV} = (2814.816 + 2818.695) \\text{ MeV} = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV} = 5.633511 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E = \\gamma E_0 = 3.57142857 * 5.633511 \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.11968 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis confirms that the intended calculation was based on the sum of the masses of the constituent nucleons, not the bound nucleus mass. The result 20.11968 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
