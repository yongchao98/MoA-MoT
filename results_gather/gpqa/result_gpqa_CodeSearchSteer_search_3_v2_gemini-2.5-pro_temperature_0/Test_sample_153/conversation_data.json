    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% is a classic M+2 isotope pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is roughly 76% ³⁵Cl and 24% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+/(M+2) peak ratio of about 3:1. This confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and the molecular weight is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with the carbonyl group in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a significant downfield shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. This pattern is a hallmark of para-substitution. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm these chemical shifts.\n\n### **Evaluation of Alternatives:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region due to the lack of symmetry.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton seen at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is inconsistent with the ¹H NMR data, as it would show an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) and a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR Spectroscopy unequivocally points to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
