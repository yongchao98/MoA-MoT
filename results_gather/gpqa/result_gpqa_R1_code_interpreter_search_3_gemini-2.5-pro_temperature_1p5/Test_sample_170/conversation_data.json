    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring with a single substituent. The question asks to order the starting substances based on the increasing yield of the *para*-substituted product. The yield is given as a \"weight fraction,\" which is directly proportional to the percentage yield of that isomer.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** The key to determining the product distribution in electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nature of the substituent already on the ring. We need to classify each substituent as either activating or deactivating, and as an ortho/para-director or a meta-director.\n\n    *   **Substance 1: Toluene (C6H5-CH3)**\n        *   -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It's an electron-donating group (EDG) via induction and hyperconjugation.\n        *   **Effect:** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n    *   **Substance 2: Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)**\n        *   -COOC2H5 (ester) has a carbonyl group attached to the ring. The carbonyl is strongly electron-withdrawing via resonance.\n        *   **Effect:** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n    *   **Substance 3: Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)**\n        *   -Cl (chloro) is a halogen. It's electron-withdrawing via induction but electron-donating via resonance. The inductive effect is stronger, making the ring deactivated overall. However, the resonance donation directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n        *   **Effect:** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n    *   **Substance 4: Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)**\n        *   -NO2 (nitro) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) through both induction and resonance.\n        *   **Effect:** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n    *   **Substance 5: Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)**\n        *   -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group, similar to methyl but slightly more electron-donating and larger.\n        *   **Effect:** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n    *   **Substance 6: Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)**\n        *   -COOH (carboxyl) has a carbonyl group attached to the ring, similar to the ester. It's an electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   **Effect:** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n3.  **Group the Substances by Directing Effect:**\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These will produce very little para-isomer. The main product will be meta.\n        *   4 (C6H5-NO2)\n        *   6 (C6H5-COOH)\n        *   2 (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n    *   **Ortho/para-directors:** These will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n        *   1 (C6H5-CH3)\n        *   5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n        *   3 (C6H5-Cl)\n\n4.  **Order Substances within the Meta-directing Group:**\n    The para-isomer yield for this group will be very low. The order depends on how strongly each group directs meta. A stronger deactivating group leads to higher selectivity for the meta position, and consequently, a lower yield of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   The deactivating strength order is: -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2)** is the strongest deactivator, making it highly meta-selective. The para-isomer yield is extremely low (typically <1%).\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH)** is also a strong deactivator. Its para-isomer yield is very low, but slightly higher than for nitrobenzene (typically 1-2%).\n    *   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5)** is electronically similar to benzoic acid. Its deactivating effect is slightly less than -COOH, so it is slightly less selective for the meta position, resulting in a slightly higher para yield (typically 3-5%).\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Order Substances within the Ortho/para-directing Group:**\n    For this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio), which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3) vs. Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This steric hindrance makes it more difficult for the incoming bromine electrophile to attack the ortho positions, thus favoring the para position. So, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. Typical para yields: Toluene (~62%), Ethylbenzene (~65%). So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. Although deactivating, they are strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of minimizing dipole repulsion and resonance stabilization being most effective at the para position. Chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination (typically ~89%). This is significantly higher than for the alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: **1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**.\n\n6.  **Combine the two groups:**\n    The para-isomer yields for all meta-directors are much lower than for any of the ortho/para-directors.\n    *   Low para yield group: 4 < 6 < 2\n    *   High para yield group: 1 < 5 < 3\n\n    Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The derived order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3. This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect\n    *   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect (decreasing order)\n    *   C) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - Correct\n    *   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the reaction:** The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of a substituted benzene ring. The goal is to arrange the starting materials in order of increasing yield (weight fraction) of the *para*-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the directing effect and steric properties of the substituent already on the ring.\n\n2.  **Classify the substituents:** We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors** will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. These include activating groups (like alkyls) and halogens.\n    *   **Meta-directors** will produce mainly the meta-isomer, with very small amounts of the ortho and para isomers. These are deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR).\n\n3.  **Group the substances based on directing effects:**\n\n    *   **Group 1: Meta-directors (expect low para-isomer yield)**\n        *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group and a strong *meta*-director. It will produce the lowest amount of the para-isomer.\n        *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also a strong electron-withdrawing group and a *meta*-director. It is less deactivating than -NO2, so it will produce slightly more para-isomer than nitrobenzene.\n        *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is an electron-withdrawing group and a *meta*-director, similar in strength to -COOH but generally considered slightly weaker. It will produce slightly more para-isomer than benzoic acid.\n        *   **Order within this group (increasing para yield):** 4 < 6 < 2\n\n    *   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (expect high para-isomer yield)**\n        *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors attack at the *ortho* position, thus leading to a higher percentage of the *para* product compared to toluene. So, the para yield for toluene (1) will be less than that for ethylbenzene (5).\n        *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a halogen. While it deactivates the ring overall, it is an *ortho, para*-director. Halogens are known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer, often more so than alkyl groups. Therefore, chlorobenzene will produce the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n        *   **Order within this group (increasing para yield):** 1 < 5 < 3\n\n4.  **Combine the groups:** Since any meta-director will produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than any ortho, para-director, we can combine the two ordered groups.\n\n    *   The complete order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n        **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n5.  **Match with the options:** The calculated order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires an understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution and the directing effects of various substituents on a benzene ring. The yield of the *para*-isomer depends on two main factors:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Is the substituent an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*?\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** For *ortho, para-directors*, how bulky is the substituent? A bulkier substituent will favor the *para* position over the *ortho* positions.\n\nLet's analyze each substance:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents into meta-directors and ortho, para-directors.**\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These are electron-withdrawing groups that deactivate the ring. They produce very low yields of the *para*-isomer because the *meta*-isomer is the major product.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivator and *meta*-director. It will produce the lowest yield of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is a deactivator and *meta*-director. It is less deactivating than -NO2.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group is also a deactivator and *meta*-director, generally considered slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the *ortho* and *para* positions. They will produce high yields of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (alkyl) group is an activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (alkyl) group is also an activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (halogen) group is a deactivator but is an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**Step 2: Order the substances within each group.**\n\n*   **Ordering the meta-directors (lowest para yield):**\n    The yield of the *para*-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the more strongly it directs *meta*, and the less *para*-isomer is formed.\n    The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\n    This corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ordering the ortho, para-directors (highest para yield):**\n    Here, we must consider the ratio of *para* to *ortho* product.\n    *   Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5): The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This steric hindrance makes it more difficult for the bromine to attack the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the relative yield of the *para* product. Therefore, the *para* yield for toluene is less than for ethylbenzene. The order is: **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3): Halogens, like -Cl, are known to be strongly *para*-directing, giving a very high ratio of *para* to *ortho* product (often the para isomer is >85% of the yield). This effect is stronger than for simple alkyl groups. Thus, chlorobenzene will have the highest *para* yield in this group.\n    So, the complete order for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    This corresponds to the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the two groups.**\n\nThe *para*-isomer yield for any *meta*-director will be significantly lower than for any *ortho, para*-director. By combining the two ordered lists, we get the final overall order.\n\n(Order of meta-directors) < (Order of ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2)** < **(1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring that already has a substituent. The goal is to arrange the starting compounds in order of *increasing* yield of the *para*-isomer. This yield depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent.\n\n**2. Classify Substituents as Ortho, Para-directors or Meta-directors**\n\nThis is the most critical step. Substituents that are *meta*-directors will produce very little *para*-isomer, while *ortho, para*-directors will produce a significant amount.\n\n*   **Group A: Meta-directors (low para yield)**\n    These are electron-withdrawing groups that deactivate the ring.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is a very strong deactivator and a strong *meta*-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ester) group is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Group B: Ortho, Para-directors (high para yield)**\n    These are either activating groups or halogens.\n    *   **1) С6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (alkyl) group is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (alkyl) group is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (halogen) is a deactivator but is an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final order will have all the substances from Group A before the substances from Group B.\n\n**3. Order the Substances Within the Meta-directing Group (Group A)**\n\nFor these substances, the *para*-isomer is a minor product. The yield of the *para*-isomer will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a better *meta*-director, and thus produces less *para*-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5**\n*   This corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Substances Within the Ortho, Para-directing Group (Group B)**\n\nFor these substances, the *para*-isomer is a major product. The relative yield depends on the *para* to *ortho* ratio, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it more difficult for the bromine electrophile to attack the nearby *ortho* positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered *para* position. This means ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the *para*-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens are strongly *para*-directing. The *para* to *ortho* ratio for halogenated benzenes is typically much higher than for alkylbenzenes. Bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% *para*-isomer, which is higher than the typical yield for toluene (~62%) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, chlorobenzene will have the highest *para* yield in this group.\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n*   Combining these observations gives the order for Group B: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**5. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nWe place the ordered Group A before the ordered Group B:\n\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the *para*-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires ranking substituted benzenes by the increasing yield of their *para*-brominated product after an electrophilic substitution reaction. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the electronic and steric properties of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents as Ortho, Para-Directors or Meta-Directors**\n\nFirst, we divide the substituents into two main groups based on where they direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+).\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield)**\n    These are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivators) that direct the new substituent to the *meta* position. They will produce a very small amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivator and a strong *meta*-director.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield)**\n    These are groups that direct the new substituent to the *ortho* and *para* positions. They will produce a significant amount of the *para*-isomer.\n    *   **1) С6H5-CH3:** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivator but is an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThis initial sorting tells us that the final sequence will have all substances from Group 1 (4, 6, 2) before all substances from Group 2 (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Rank the Substances Within Each Group**\n\n*   **Ranking the Meta-Directors (Group 1):**\n    The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly the group directs *meta*, and therefore the *less* *para*-isomer is formed. The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield is the reverse: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5.\n    This gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ranking the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2):**\n    For this group, the yield of the *para*-product depends on the ratio of *para* to *ortho* isomers formed. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance.\n    *   Comparing **1 (-CH3)** and **5 (-C2H5)**: The ethyl group is larger (bulkier) than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk makes it harder for the bromine to attack the nearby *ortho* positions, favoring attack at the more accessible *para* position. Thus, ethylbenzene produces a higher proportion of the *para*-isomer than toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   Comparing with **3 (-Cl)**: Halogens are known to be highly *para*-directing, often yielding the *para*-isomer as the major product by a large margin (e.g., ~87% for chlorobenzene). This is a stronger *para*-directing effect than that of simple alkyl groups.\n    Therefore, the order of increasing *para*-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    This gives the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ranked Groups**\n\nBy combining the two ranked lists, we get the final overall order from the lowest *para* yield to the highest *para* yield:\n\n(Group 1 order) < (Group 2 order)\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
