    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n    ```\n          H       C3H7\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n        C3H7      H\n    (C3H7 = propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction involves the *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, if a chiral product is formed, it must be as a racemic mixture. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral (it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Therefore, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a good leaving group. A water molecule then attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the backside (anti-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack. This overall two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   Let's consider the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Backside attack by water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R becomes S), leaving C5 unchanged. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 leads to inversion at C5 (R becomes S), leaving C4 unchanged. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products, (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral, meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or center of inversion).\n    *   The same meso-diol is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer as well.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n    ```\n          H         H\n           \\       /\n            C = C\n           /       \\\n        C3H7      C3H7\n    ```\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** This is again an *anti*-attack by water on the protonated epoxide.\n    *   We start with the meso-epoxide (let's denote its chiral centers as 4R, 5S for one representation).\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, resulting in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, resulting in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Part 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times and be separated into different peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, as they can interact differently with the chiral phase.\n    *   Chiral columns can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the resulting products using two different types of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        H       C3H7\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      C3H7      H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent is used for epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom to the double bond is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene. When a *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition, it forms a *trans*-epoxide. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction must produce a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the backside (*anti*-attack), leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n3.  **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The mnemonic for stereochemical outcomes is helpful here: a ***trans***-alkene undergoing ***anti***-addition results in a ***meso*** product (if the substitution pattern allows for a meso compound).\n\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry for one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane. Backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products, (4S,5R)-diol and (4R,5S)-diol, are the same molecule. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral *meso* compound. Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane, also yields the same meso-diol.\n\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        H         H\n         \\       /\n          C = C\n         /       \\\n      C3H7      C3H7\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents:** The same reagents are used as in Reaction 1.\n\n3.  **Overall Transformation:** Again, this is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The mnemonic for a ***cis***-alkene undergoing ***anti***-addition is that it results in a ***racemic*** mixture.\n\n    *   Let's trace the stereochemistry. First, the *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces the *cis*-epoxide (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is an achiral meso compound.\n    *   Next, the acid-catalyzed *anti*-attack by water opens the ring.\n        *   Attack at one carbon (say, C4) gives one enantiomer, for example, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) gives the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the products are formed in a 50:50 ratio.\n\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso compound (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Conclusion: The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities.\n    *   Since the chiral column can separate enantiomers, it will resolve the racemic mixture from Reaction 2 into two separate peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound, which is a diastereomer of the other two compounds.\n    *   Conclusion: The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe standard HPLC will show 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomers), and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a detailed understanding of stereochemistry, specifically the outcomes of reactions on alkenes and the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis**\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene, *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the chiral epoxide product is formed as a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening.** This step proceeds via an *anti*-attack mechanism. A water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon. This two-step process (*syn*-epoxidation followed by *anti*-opening) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key principle in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (if the substitution pattern allows, which it does here). Let's confirm:\n    *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. Both (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same single, achiral *meso* compound.\n    *   The same meso-diol is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen results in a *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral *meso* compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed Ring Opening.** This is an *anti*-attack by water on the protonated *meso*-epoxide.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The second key principle is that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, backside attack by water at C4 will yield one enantiomer of the diol (e.g., (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol), while attack at C5 will yield the other enantiomer ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, the product is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **Isomer A:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **Isomer B:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   **Isomer C:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe relationships are:\n*   Isomers B and C are **enantiomers**.\n*   Isomer A is a **diastereomer** of both B and C.\n\n**Chromatographic Separation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like A vs. B, and A vs. C) have different physical properties and thus different affinities for the stationary phase. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (B vs. C) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: Peak 1 for meso-diol (Isomer A) and Peak 2 for the co-eluting enantiomers (Isomers B + C).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (A from B and C).\n    *   It will also separate the enantiomers (B from C) because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: Peak 1 for the meso-diol (Isomer A), Peak 2 for one enantiomer (e.g., Isomer B), and Peak 3 for the other enantiomer (Isomer C).\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: **2 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of stereochemistry and analytical chemistry. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is achiral because it possesses a C₂ axis of rotation and a center of inversion.\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition yields a *trans*-epoxide. The product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is chiral. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** In the presence of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), the epoxide is protonated, and then water attacks one of the carbons of the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with backside attack, resulting in *anti*-dihydroxylation relative to the original double bond. The stereochemistry is inverted at the carbon that is attacked.\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a useful mnemonic for these reactions: **Trans-Anti-Meso**. A **t**rans-alkene undergoing an **a**nti-addition gives a **m**eso product (provided the product can be meso). Let's confirm this by tracing the stereochemistry:\n    *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 inverts the configuration to S, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C5 inverts the configuration to S, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The molecules (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso** compound. The same product is formed from the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 1 & 2: Epoxidation followed by Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The reaction sequence is the same, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic here is: **Cis-Anti-Racemic**. A **c**is-alkene undergoing an **a**nti-addition gives a **r**acemic mixture of enantiomers. Let's trace this:\n    *   The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces the *cis*-epoxide (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane). This is an achiral meso compound.\n    *   The *anti*-attack by water on this meso-epoxide opens the ring. Attack on the two different carbons results in the formation of two different products which are mirror images of each other.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are enantiomers.\n    *   Since attack on either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Mixture and HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships are as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols.\n\nNow we analyze the HPLC chromatograms:\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This column separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will have different retention times. Thus, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will not be separated and will elute from the column at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Result:** There will be **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This column contains a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (meso vs. the others).\n    *   It will also separate the enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol vs. (4S,5S)-diol) because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   **Result:** All three distinct stereoisomers will be separated, producing **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene.

A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the chiral epoxide product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is formed as a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is opened by a backside (*anti*) attack of a water molecule. This step results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. A reliable stereochemical rule is that the **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** produces a **meso** compound (if the substitution pattern allows for one, as it does here).\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is an achiral compound despite having two chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   The first step (epoxidation) produces the meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step (hydrolysis) involves backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide. Attack at the two different carbons of the epoxide ring leads to the formation of two products that are mirror images of each other.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 50:50 racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   Chiral columns can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Result:** All three unique stereoisomers—the meso compound, the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and the (4S,5S) enantiomer—will be resolved into separate peaks. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?\n\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
