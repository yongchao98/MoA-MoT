    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem involves determining the condition to distinguish between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This is governed by the Heisenberg's Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in the time for which the particle is in that state (Δt) are related by the inequality:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n3.  **Relate Lifetime to Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime (τ) of a quantum state is the characteristic time for which the particle exists in that state. We can consider this lifetime as the uncertainty in time, Δt = τ. Consequently, an energy level is not infinitely sharp but has a natural \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE), given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:** We are given two states with lifetimes:\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    To work with the options given in electron-volts (eV), we use the value of ħ in eV·s:\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, calculate the energy width for each state:\n    *   **State 1:** ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:** ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels (visualized as two distribution peaks) to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the separation between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be at least as large as the total width of the two levels. The total width is the sum of the individual widths.\n    *   Resolution Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    *   ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   ΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We need to find which of the given options satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (This is 1 x 10⁻⁴ eV, which is 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg's Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle. Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**2. Lifetime and Energy Width**\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of an excited state represents the average time it exists before decaying. We can relate this lifetime to the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, each energy level is not infinitely sharp but has a natural \"energy width\" or uncertainty (ΔE). We can approximate this width as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis ΔE represents the inherent \"blurriness\" of the energy level.\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than the combined uncertainty or \"blurriness\" of the two levels. A conservative criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy width for each state using the given lifetimes.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNow, calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution:\n\n*   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than our calculated minimum energy difference of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV << 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nOnly option B (10⁻⁴ eV) is significantly larger than the minimum energy separation required to resolve the two energy levels.\n\nThe previous python code confirmed these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_evs = 6.582119569e-16 # Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Energy widths\ndelta_e1 = h_bar_evs / tau1\ndelta_e2 = h_bar_evs / tau2\n\n# Minimum energy difference for resolution\nmin_energy_diff = delta_e1 + delta_e2\n\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference: {min_energy_diff:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check options\noption_B = 1e-4\nprint(f\"Is option B ({option_B:.1e} eV) greater than the minimum? {option_B > min_energy_diff}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nRequired minimum energy difference: 7.240e-07 eV\nIs option B (1.0e-04 eV) greater than the minimum? True\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms our manual calculation. The energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
