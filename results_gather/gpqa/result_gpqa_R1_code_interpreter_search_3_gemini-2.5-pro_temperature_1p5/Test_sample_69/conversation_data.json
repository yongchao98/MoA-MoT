    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Hydrolysis Reaction (Clue 3)**\n*   `C + Water -> A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)`\n*   This reaction regenerates solid A and produces two different acids. The regeneration of A suggests it might be an elemental substance acting as a substrate or catalyst, or it is a very stable compound that is reformed.\n*   The formation of two acids F and G from the reaction of C with water suggests that the components of these acids (minus the hydrogen and some oxygen from water) must come from C, and therefore from B (since `A + 8B -> C`).\n*   A well-known reaction that produces a strong acid and a weak acid is the disproportionation of halogens in water. Let's test chlorine:\n    `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO`\n    *   F = HCl (hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n    *   G = HClO (hypochlorous acid), which is a weak acid.\n*   This perfectly matches the description. If this is the case, it implies that the reacting part of compound C is effectively chlorine, `Cl₂`. This makes `B = Cl₂` gas.\n*   This hypothesis also means that C must be a compound or adduct containing A and a large amount of chlorine, i.e., `C = A·(Cl₂)x`. The hydrolysis reaction would be: `A·(Cl₂)x + xH₂O -> A + xHCl + xHClO`. This regenerates A and produces the two required acids.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gases B and D, and Solvent H (Clue 4)**\n*   Based on Step 1, we hypothesize `B = Cl₂` (chlorine gas).\n*   The clue states `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Substituting B: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) -> H(solvent)`\n*   A very common industrial reaction between a gas D and chlorine gas (Cl₂) that produces a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene:\n    `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l/g)`\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) has a boiling point of 8 °C, so it can be a liquid, and it is used as a solvent in some chemical applications.\n*   This leads to the identification:\n    *   `B = Cl₂`\n    *   `D = CO` (carbon monoxide gas)\n    *   `H = COCl₂` (phosgene)\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C (Clue 1)**\n*   `A(s) + 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n*   Substituting B: `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> C(red)`\n*   As established in Step 1, C is likely an adduct or compound of A and chlorine, `C = A·(Cl₂)₈` or `ACl₁₆`. The exact identity of solid A and the nature of the red compound C is difficult to determine and not strictly necessary for the final answer, but we have established C is a high-chlorine content compound. The key is that C acts as a store of elemental chlorine.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Hazardous Product E (Clue 2)**\n*   `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   Substituting C and D: `C (a source of Cl₂) + 2 CO(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n*   We have the reactants CO and Cl₂ (from C). These are the same reactants that form phosgene (H). It is highly likely that E is also phosgene.\n    `2Cl₂ (from C) + 2CO -> 2COCl₂`\n    This reaction consumes 2 equivalents of CO and would require C to supply at least 2 equivalents of Cl₂.\n*   Therefore, `E = COCl₂` (phosgene). Phosgene is well-known as an extremely hazardous and toxic substance (it was used as a chemical weapon).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   We have identified `E = COCl₂` (phosgene).\n*   Now we need to find its molecular point group.\n*   The phosgene molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **C₂ axis:** A 2-fold rotation axis passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves the C and O atoms unchanged while swapping the positions of the two Cl atoms. The molecule appears unchanged.\n    3.  **Mirror Plane (σᵥ):** The plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane. All atoms lie in this plane.\n    4.  **Mirror Plane (σᵥ'):** A second mirror plane is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis (the C=O bond). This plane bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) C₂\nB) D∞h\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂v\n\nOur derived point group for E (phosgene) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 - The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n\n*   The clue states: `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n*   The formation of two different acids from a single precursor reacting with water is characteristic of the hydrolysis of certain non-metal halides or oxides. A classic example is the disproportionation of halogens in water.\n*   Let's hypothesize that the reaction involves chlorine (`Cl₂`). The reaction of chlorine with water is: `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO`.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a **strong acid**. This matches the description of F.\n    *   `HClO` (hypochlorous acid) is a **weak acid**. This matches the description of G.\n*   This hypothesis fits the observations perfectly. It implies that compound C acts as a source of chlorine (`Cl₂`) and that solid A is regenerated. Therefore, we can deduce that gas **B is chlorine, `Cl₂`**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4 - The Formation of Solvent H**\n\n*   The clue states: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n*   Substituting our identified substance for B: `D(g) + Cl₂(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio).\n*   We need to identify a common gas `D` that reacts with chlorine in a 1:1 ratio to produce a solvent `H`. A well-known industrial reaction is the synthesis of phosgene:\n    *   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l/g)`\n*   This reaction matches the 1:1 stoichiometry. `COCl₂` (phosgene) has a boiling point of 8 °C, so it can exist as a liquid, and it is used as a reagent and solvent in some chemical contexts.\n*   This allows us to identify:\n    *   **D = `CO`** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H = `COCl₂`** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2 - The Formation of Hazardous Product E**\n\n*   The clue states: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   Substituting our identified substances: `C + 2 CO(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n*   From Step 1, we know C is a source of `Cl₂`. The most logical reaction between a chlorine source and carbon monoxide is the formation of phosgene, which we already identified as H.\n    *   `2 Cl₂ (from C) + 2 CO -> 2 COCl₂`\n*   This reaction consumes 2 equivalents of `CO`, as stated in the clue, and produces `COCl₂`. Phosgene is infamous for being an **extremely hazardous** chemical warfare agent.\n*   Therefore, the product **E is phosgene, `COCl₂`**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1 - The Formation of C**\n\n*   The clue states: `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n*   Substituting B: `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> C(bright red)`\n*   While the exact identity of A and C is not required to answer the question, this confirms our model. C is a super-chlorinated adduct or complex of A, `A·(Cl₂)₈`, which can then release `Cl₂` for other reactions. The existence of such polyhalide complexes is known, confirming the consistency of our deductions.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (`COCl₂`)**\n\n*   We have confidently identified **E as phosgene, `COCl₂`**.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group (point group), we must analyze its molecular geometry and symmetry elements.\n*   **Geometry**: The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Due to sp² hybridization, the molecule is trigonal planar.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    1.  **E (Identity)**: Present in all molecules.\n    2.  **C₂ (Two-fold rotation axis)**: There is one `C₂` axis that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule by 180° around this axis exchanges the positions of the two chlorine atoms, leaving the molecule's appearance unchanged.\n    3.  **σᵥ (Vertical mirror plane)**: There are two such planes.\n        *   One plane is the plane of the molecule itself. Reflecting across this plane leaves all atoms in place.\n        *   A second plane is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the `C₂` axis (and thus the C and O atoms). Reflecting across this plane exchanges the two chlorine atoms.\n*   A molecule that possesses the symmetry elements E, one C₂ axis, and two vertical mirror planes (`σᵥ`) belongs to the **`C₂v` point group**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is phosgene (`COCl₂`), and its molecular symmetry group is `C₂v`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues to Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    This is the most revealing clue. The formation of a strong acid and a weak acid from a single precursor in water is a classic disproportionation reaction, characteristic of halogens (like chlorine, bromine, or iodine). Let's test chlorine:\n    `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid)`\n    This reaction perfectly matches the description of producing acids F (HCl) and G (HClO). This strongly suggests that gas **B** is **Cl₂** (chlorine), and compound C acts as a source for `Cl₂`.\n\n*   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    Substituting `B = Cl₂`, the reaction is:\n    `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`\n    A common industrial reaction that fits this 1:1 stoichiometry is the synthesis of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine:\n    `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)`\n    Phosgene (`COCl₂`) has a low boiling point (8 °C) but can be used as a liquid solvent or reagent. This allows us to identify gas **D** as **CO** (carbon monoxide) and the solvent **H** as **COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Hazardous Product E**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Substituting our findings:\n    `C + 2 CO(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`\n    Since we know C is a source of `Cl₂` and the other reactant is `CO`, the product E must be formed from these two substances. The logical product is phosgene, which we have already encountered as H.\n    The reaction is: `2Cl₂ (from C) + 2CO → 2COCl₂`\n    This stoichiometry consumes 2 equivalents of `CO`, matching the clue. Phosgene (`COCl₂`) is a notorious chemical warfare agent and is classified as **extremely hazardous**.\n    Therefore, product **E** is **COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (COCl₂)**\n\nNow that we have identified E as phosgene (`COCl₂`), we can determine its molecular geometry and symmetry.\n\n1.  **Molecular Geometry:** The central atom is carbon. It forms a double bond with the oxygen atom and single bonds with the two chlorine atoms. According to VSEPR theory, the three electron domains around the central carbon arrange themselves in a **trigonal planar** geometry.\n\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule has one two-fold rotation axis (**C₂**) that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis swaps the two chlorine atoms, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σ):** The molecule has two mirror planes.\n        *   One mirror plane (**σᵥ**) is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   A second mirror plane (**σᵥ'**) is perpendicular to the first and contains the C₂ axis. This plane bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes that contain this axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D∞h\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂ᵥ\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group for E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step logical deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Deciphering Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n\n*   **Clue:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n*   **Reasoning:** The formation of two different acids (one strong, one weak) from a single precursor reacting with water is a hallmark of the disproportionation reaction of a halogen. Let's consider chlorine (Cl₂):\n    *   `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO`\n    *   In this reaction, `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a **strong acid** (F), and `HClO` (hypochlorous acid) is a **weak acid** (G).\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a perfect match. This allows us to deduce that gas **B** must be **Cl₂** (chlorine gas), and compound C acts as a source of Cl₂.\n\n**2. Deciphering Clue 4: Formation of a Solvent**\n\n*   **Clue:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n*   **Reasoning:** Substituting our finding for B, the reaction is `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)`. A well-known industrial reaction that fits this 1:1 stoichiometry is the synthesis of phosgene from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine.\n    *   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l)`\n*   **Conclusion:** The gas **D** is **CO** (carbon monoxide), and the solvent **H** is **COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**3. Deciphering Clue 2: Formation of the Hazardous Product**\n\n*   **Clue:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   **Reasoning:** We know C is a source of `Cl₂` and D is `CO`. The reaction is therefore between chlorine and carbon monoxide, which, as established in the previous step, produces phosgene. The stoichiometry given (`2` equivalents of `D`) confirms this:\n    *   `2 Cl₂ (from C) + 2 CO → 2 COCl₂`\n*   **Conclusion:** The product **E** is **COCl₂** (phosgene). Phosgene is infamous for its use as a chemical weapon and is indeed an **extremely hazardous** substance.\n\n**4. Deciphering Clue 1: Formation of C**\n\n*   **Clue:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n*   **Reasoning:** `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C(bright red)`. This tells us C is a chlorine-rich adduct or complex. While we don't need the exact identity of A, this information is consistent with our model where C is a stable \"carrier\" for reactive chlorine gas.\n\n**5. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E (Phosgene, COCl₂)**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified E as phosgene, we need to find its molecular symmetry group.\n\n*   **Structure:** The phosgene molecule has a central carbon atom. It is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Due to the three regions of electron density, the molecule adopts a **trigonal planar** geometry.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** Every molecule has an identity element.\n    *   **C₂ Axis:** There is one 2-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes directly through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis swaps the two chlorine atoms, leaving the molecule's appearance unchanged.\n    *   **Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are two vertical mirror planes. One is the plane of the molecule itself. The second is perpendicular to the molecular plane, contains the C₂ axis, and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule with one C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D∞h\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂v\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning used to solve the chemical riddle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**1. Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n\n*   **Clue:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n*   **Reasoning:** This clue describes a disproportionation reaction. A single substance reacting with water to form two different acids is characteristic of halogens. Let's test the reaction of chlorine (Cl₂) with water:\n    `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO`\n*   **Identification:**\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a well-known **strong acid**. This matches the description of **F**.\n    *   `HClO` (hypochlorous acid) is a **weak acid**. This matches the description of **G**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a perfect fit.

Analyze Clue 4: The Synthesis of a Solvent**\n\n*   **Clue:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n*   **Reasoning:** We have identified `B` as `Cl₂`.

Analyze Clue 2: The Formation of the Hazardous Product**\n\n*   **Clue:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n*   **Reasoning:** Substituting our identified compounds, the reaction is `C (a source of Cl₂) + 2 CO → E`. The reaction between chlorine and carbon monoxide produces phosgene. Phosgene is a well-known chemical warfare agent and is considered **extremely hazardous**. The stoichiometry is also consistent:\n    `2Cl₂ (from C) + 2CO → 2COCl₂`\n*   **Conclusion:** The hazardous product **E** is **COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**4.
