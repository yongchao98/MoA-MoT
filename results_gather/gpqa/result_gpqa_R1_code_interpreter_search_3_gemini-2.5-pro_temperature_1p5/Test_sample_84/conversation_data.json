    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its albedo. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = Planet's orbital semi-major axis\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the full expression:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio Expression:** I'll look for terms that cancel out based on the information given in the problem.\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same and cancel.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so A_1 = A_2. This means the (1 - A)^(1/4) term also cancels out.\n    *   The factor of 2 in the square root also cancels.\n\n    After simplification, the expression becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n5.  **Identify the New Goal:** The problem has now been reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n6.  **Find a Way to Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: planet masses (M_p) and the Doppler shifts (Δλ) they induce. This is the key.\n\n7.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Velocity:** The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the star (K, the semi-amplitude).\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    Where 'c' is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n8.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2))\n\n    Let's simplify this using the problem's information:\n    *   Orbits are circular, so eccentricity e = 0, and sqrt(1 - e^2) = 1.\n    *   The planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), so (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n    *   Both planets are detected by the transit method, which implies their orbits are nearly edge-on to us. Therefore, the inclination `i` is close to 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1. We assume sin(i) is the same for both planets.\n\n    An alternative and simpler formula relating these quantities for circular orbits is derived from the conservation of momentum and orbital mechanics:\n    K ≈ M_p / M_star * v_p = M_p / M_star * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    (Assuming sin(i) = 1)\n\n9.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** I need to rearrange the formula to solve for 'a'.\n    K^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n10. **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star are constant and cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n11. **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **Velocity Ratio (K_1 / K_2):**\n        K is proportional to Δλ (since c and λ_0 are constant).\n        K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n12. **Calculate a_2 / a_1:** Substitute the component ratios back into the formula from step 10.\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n13. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of a_2 / a_1 back into the formula from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n14. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the options, I will calculate the decimal value of 15/28.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 11: Define the ratios\nratio_mass_p2_p1 = 5 / 7\nratio_doppler_1_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 # This is equal to the K1/K2 ratio\n\n# Step 12: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\nratio_a2_a1 = (ratio_mass_p2_p1)**2 * (ratio_doppler_1_2)**2\n\n# Step 13 & 14: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2)\nratio_temp_1_2 = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_a1)\n\nprint(ratio_temp_1_2)\n```\n\nThis leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, A is the planet's albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so A_1 = A_2.

The given data includes planet masses (M_p) and the Doppler shifts (Δλ) they induce, which are related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\n\n6.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the radial velocity amplitude K that it induces on its star is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume inclination `i` ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\n7.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express 'a' in terms of the other variables.\n    K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n8.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2) ]\n    *   The Gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star are the same for both systems, so they cancel out.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to:\n        a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n        a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n9.  **Calculating the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** M_p1 = 7 M_Earth, M_p2 = 5 M_Earth.\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **Radial Velocity Ratio:** The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ₀).

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula that balances the energy it absorbs from its star with the energy it radiates:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We create the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms cancel out based on the problem statement:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel.\n    *   The problem states \"both planets possess the same albedo,\" so A₁ = A₂. This causes the (1 - A)^(1/4) term to cancel.\n    *   The constant '2' in the denominator under the square root also cancels.\n    *   This leaves a greatly simplified expression:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1 / a₁) / √(1 / a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Connect to Observational Data:** The problem now hinges on finding the ratio a₂ / a₁. This must be derived from the provided radial velocity (RV) and mass information. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We rearrange the formula to isolate 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Formulate the Ratio a₂ / a₁:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_1²)]\n    *   The constants G and M_star are the same for both calculations and cancel out.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K_1²)\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n8.  **Calculate Component Ratios from Given Values:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_Earth, M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n        => M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):** The RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, their ratio is the same.\n        Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å, Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n        => K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Calculate a₂ / a₁:** Substitute the component ratios into the formula from step 7.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the result for a₂ / a₁ into the formula from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Result:** To compare with the multiple-choice options, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by sqrt(a2/a1)\n# The ratio a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n\n# Values from the problem\nmass_planet1 = 7\nmass_planet2 = 5\ndoppler_shift1 = 0.03\ndoppler_shift2 = 0.04\n\n# Ratio of masses (Mp2/Mp1)\nmass_ratio = mass_planet2 / mass_planet1\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2) is the same as the ratio of Doppler shifts\nrv_ratio = doppler_shift1 / doppler_shift2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\naxis_ratio = (mass_ratio)**2 * (rv_ratio)**2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = math.sqrt(axis_ratio)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
