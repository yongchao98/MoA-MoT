    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State:**\n    The spin state of the electron is given by the vector (3i, 4). In quantum mechanics, this is represented as a column vector or \"ket\" `|ψ>`:\n    ```\n    |ψ> = [ 3i ]\n          [ 4  ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Define the Conjugate Transpose:**\n    To calculate the expectation value, we also need the \"bra\" vector `<ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`. To find the conjugate transpose, we take the transpose of the matrix and find the complex conjugate of each element (i.e., replace `i` with `-i`).\n    The transpose of `|ψ>` is `[3i, 4]`.\n    The conjugate transpose is `<ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n3.  **Normalize the State:**\n    Physical states must be normalized. The normalization condition is `<ψ|ψ> = 1`. First, let's calculate the inner product `<ψ|ψ>` for the given unnormalized state.\n    ```\n    <ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]\n                         [ 4  ]\n         = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)\n         = -9(i^2) + 16\n         = -9(-1) + 16\n         = 9 + 16\n         = 25\n    ```\n    The squared norm is 25. The normalization constant `N` is `1/sqrt(25) = 1/5`.\n    The normalized state `|ψ_norm>` is `(1/5) |ψ>`.\n\n4.  **Define the Spin Operator S_y:**\n    The spin operator in the y-direction, `S_y`, is given by:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n    Where `ħ` (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    The problem provides `σ_y`:\n    ```\n    σ_y = [ 0  -i ]\n          [ i   0 ]\n    ```\n    So, the `S_y` operator is:\n    ```\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] = [ 0     -iħ/2 ]\n                   [ i   0 ]   [ iħ/2   0    ]\n    ```\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    The expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is given by `<A> = <ψ| A |ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`.\n    Since we've already calculated `<ψ|ψ> = 25`, the formula becomes:\n    `<S_y> = (1/25) * <ψ| S_y |ψ>`\n\n    Let's first compute the term `S_y |ψ>`:\n    ```\n    S_y |ψ> = [ 0     -iħ/2 ] * [ 3i ]\n              [ iħ/2   0    ]   [ 4  ]\n\n           = [ (0)(3i) + (-iħ/2)(4)   ]\n             [ (iħ/2)(3i) + (0)(4)     ]\n\n           = [ -4iħ/2 ]\n             [ 3i^2ħ/2 ]\n\n           = [ -2iħ ]\n             [ -3ħ/2]\n    ```\n\n    Now, let's multiply this by `<ψ|`:\n    ```\n    <ψ| S_y |ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [ -2iħ ]\n                              [ -3ħ/2]\n\n                = (-3i)(-2iħ) + (4)(-3ħ/2)\n                = 6i^2ħ - 12ħ/2\n                = -6ħ - 6ħ\n                = -12ħ\n    ```\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    Now we can find the expectation value:\n    `<S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    `<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n    This can also be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated value `-12ħ/25` corresponds to option D.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify the matrix calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the spin state vector (ket)\n# Using 'j' for the imaginary unit\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the Pauli Y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], \n                    [1j,  0]])\n\n# The spin operator S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# We'll calculate the value in units of hbar/2 and then multiply.\n# So we compute <psi | sigma_y | psi> / <psi | psi>\n# The final answer will be (hbar/2) * this result.\n# Or, more directly, calculate <psi | (hbar)sigma_y | psi> / <psi | psi>\n# which gives <S_y> = result / 2.\n# Let's keep hbar as a symbolic constant and calculate the numeric part.\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose (bra)\npsi_bra = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the norm squared: <psi|psi>\nnorm_sq = np.dot(psi_bra, psi)\n# print(f\"Norm squared: {norm_sq.real}\")\n\n# Calculate sigma_y |psi>\nsigma_y_psi = np.dot(sigma_y, psi)\n# print(f\"sigma_y|psi>: {sigma_y_psi}\")\n\n# Calculate <psi| sigma_y |psi>\nbra_sigma_y_ket = np.dot(psi_bra, sigma_y_psi)\n# print(f\"<psi|sigma_y|psi>: {bra_sigma_y_ket.real}\")\n\n# The expectation value <sigma_y> is <psi|sigma_y|psi> / <psi|psi>\nexp_sigma_y = bra_sigma_y_ket / norm_sq\n# print(f\"Expectation value of sigma_y: {exp_sigma_y.real}\")\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * <sigma_y>\n# So, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (bra_sigma_y_ket / norm_sq)\n# <S_y> = (bra_sigma_y_ket / (2 * norm_sq)) * hbar\n# In the format of the answers, it's (numeric_part)*hbar / (denominator)\n\nnumerator = bra_sigma_y_ket.real\ndenominator = norm_sq.real\n# The result is (numerator / 2) * hbar / denominator\n# but the options are written as (some_number*hbar) / (another_number)\n# The calculation <psi| S_y |psi> yielded -12hbar\n# <S_y> = <psi| S_y |psi> / <psi|psi> = -12hbar / 25\n# Let's verify <psi| S_y |psi> using python\n# S_y = (1/2) * sigma_y, setting hbar=1 for now\nSy = 0.5 * sigma_y\nbra_Sy_ket = np.dot(psi_bra, np.dot(Sy, psi))\nexp_Sy = bra_Sy_ket / norm_sq\n\n# The numeric coefficient of hbar is exp_Sy\n# The result is exp_Sy * hbar\n# This should be -12/25\nfinal_numerator = bra_Sy_ket.real\nfinal_denominator = norm_sq.real\n\nprint(f\"The expectation value is {final_numerator:.2f}*hbar / {final_denominator:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"This simplifies to {int(final_numerator)}*hbar/{int(final_denominator)}\")\n\n# Let's check the options.\n# C) 12*hbar/25 -> 0.48 hbar\n# D) -12*hbar/25 -> -0.48 hbar\ncalculated_value = final_numerator / final_denominator\n# print(f\"Decimal value: {calculated_value}\") # -0.48\n# This matches -12/25\nprint(\"The result matches -12*hbar/25.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
