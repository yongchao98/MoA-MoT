    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via a two-step process involving dipole transitions. This is a cascade decay. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) will first decay to an intermediate state, which then decays to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s or ground state).\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** We need to apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are the dominant type of radiative transition.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $n$, is not restricted, but for a decay process, $n$ must decrease.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From initial state $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, so $m_i$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n        *   The principal quantum number $n_i$ must be less than 3. The most probable transition is to the nearest lower energy level, which is $n_i=2$. So, the intermediate states are in the $n=2$ shell.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These are the states of the 2p subshell.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this is an allowed transition: $l_i=1 \\to l_f=0$, so $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   For $m_i=1$, $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   For $m_i=0$, $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   For $m_i=-1$, $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n        *   So, all three potential intermediate states can indeed decay to the ground state via an E1 transition.\n\n3.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:** Based on the above, there are three possible cascade routes:\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route D: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    The options provided in the question correspond to these routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):** The \"probability\" of a given route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The second transition is from a 2p state to the 1s state. Since this is the only allowed decay channel for 2p states, its probability is 1. We need to find the relative probabilities of the three decay channels from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state.\n\n    The transition rate ($\\Gamma$) from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule. For spontaneous emission, it is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | d_x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | d_y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | d_z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    It's more convenient to use the spherical basis for the dipole operator $\\mathbf{d}=-e\\mathbf{r}$: $d_0=d_z$ and $d_{\\pm 1} = \\mp \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(d_x \\pm i d_y)$. The key relation is $|\\langle f|\\mathbf{d}|i\\rangle|^2 = \\sum_{k=x,y,z}|\\langle f|d_k|i\\rangle|^2$. Using selection rules ($m_f=m_i+q$ for operator $d_q$), we can simplify the calculation for each channel:\n\n    *   **For the transition to $|f\\rangle = |2,1,0\\rangle$:**\n        Initial state is $|i\\rangle=|3,0,0\\rangle$. $m_i=0, m_f=0$, so $\\Delta m = 0$. Only the $d_z = d_0$ component of the dipole operator contributes.\n        $\\Gamma_{|300\\rangle \\to |210\\rangle} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0|d_z|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0|d_0|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    *   **For the transition to $|f\\rangle = |2,1,1\\rangle$:**\n        $\\Delta m = 1$. Only the $d_x$ and $d_y$ components contribute. The sum of their squares simplifies to:\n        $\\Gamma_{|300\\rangle \\to |211\\rangle} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1|d_x|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,1|d_y|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1|d_{+1}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    *   **For the transition to $|f\\rangle = |2,1,-1\\rangle$:**\n        $\\Delta m = -1$. A similar calculation gives:\n        $\\Gamma_{|300\\rangle \\to |21-1\\rangle} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1|d_{-1}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    Now, we evaluate the magnitudes of these matrix elements using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which states that the matrix element is a product of a Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficient and a reduced matrix element that is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    $\\langle n'l'm' | d_q | nlm \\rangle \\propto C_{lm,1q}^{l'm'}$.\n\n    Let's calculate the squared CG coefficients for the first transition ($l=0, m=0 \\to l'=1, m'=q$):\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $q=0$. We need $|C_{00,10}^{10}|^2$. $C_{j_1 0, j_2 0}^{J0}$ for $j_2=0$ is simple, but here we add 1 and 0. For adding angular momentum 0 to 1, the result is always 1, so $C_{00,10}^{10} = 1$. Thus, $|C_{00,10}^{10}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $q=1$. We need $|C_{00,11}^{11}|^2$. Again, adding 0 and 1 gives 1. $C_{00,11}^{11} = 1$. Thus, $|C_{00,11}^{11}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $q=-1$. We need $|C_{00,1-1}^{1-1}|^2$. $C_{00,1-1}^{1-1} = 1$. Thus, $|C_{00,1-1}^{1-1}|^2 = 1$.\n\n    Since the radial integrals and frequency factors ($\\omega_{3s \\to 2p}$) are the same for all three transitions, the transition rates are proportional to these squared CG coefficients.\n    $\\Gamma_{0} : \\Gamma_{1} : \\Gamma_{-1} = 1 : 1 : 1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transition rates to the three intermediate states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are equal. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of these three states. The total probability is normalized to 1, so the probability for each path is $1/3$.\n\n    The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\n    The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and calculate the probability (branching ratio) for that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** The rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   For a decay (emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n3.  **Step 1: First Transition from |3,0,0> to an Intermediate State |n', l', m'>**\n    *   Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The intermediate state must have $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. (Since $l$ cannot be negative, $l'=1$).\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The intermediate state can have $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$, which means $m'$ can be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3. For the subsequent transition to reach $|1,0,0\\rangle$, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$. Therefore, the only possible value for $n'$ is 2.\n    *   Combining these conditions, the possible intermediate states are: $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These are the three states of the 2p subshell.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Second Transition from an Intermediate State |2, l', m'> to |1,0,0>**\n    *   Let's verify that a transition from any of the identified intermediate states to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   Initial state: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (where $m' \\in \\{1, 0, -1\\}$). So, $n'=2, l'=1$.\n    *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Check $\\Delta l$: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   Check $\\Delta m$: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n        *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n    *   Therefore, all three states ($|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) are valid intermediate states. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The \"probability\" of a specific route refers to the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability of the atom decaying into that particular intermediate state. The subsequent decay from the 2p state to the 1s state has a probability of 1, as it's the only allowed decay channel for a 2p state.\n\n    The rate of transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a set of final states $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over the degenerate final states.\n    \n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). This means there is no preferred direction in space. When the atom decays, it emits a photon. Since the initial state has no preferred orientation, the atom must decay with equal probability to each of the possible final states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, which are degenerate in the absence of external fields.\n\n    *   Total number of possible intermediate states = 3.\n    *   The total probability of decaying to one of these three states is 1 (we assume this cascade is the only decay process considered).\n    *   Since each of the three channels is equally likely, the probability for any single channel is $1/3$.\n\n    So, the probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n    The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n    The probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transitions are specified as \"dipole transitions,\" which refers to electric dipole (E1) transitions. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be 1).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (the change in the magnetic quantum number can be 0 or 1).\n    *   For an emission (decay) process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    The decay proceeds in two steps:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n    *   **For Step 1 (from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The intermediate state must have $l' = l \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$.

Thus, the three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate states of the 2p orbital.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The problem asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$), since the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) is the only allowed decay path from the 2p state and thus has a probability of 1.\n\n    We need to find the relative probabilities of decaying from the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state into each of the three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    A key principle in quantum mechanics is that for a spherically symmetric initial state (any state with $l=0$, like our $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state), there is no preferred direction in space. The three final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy and only differ by their spatial orientation. Since the initial state has no preferred orientation, the transition probability must be equal for each of these three final states.\n\n    *   Total number of available decay channels for the first step = 3.\n    *   Total probability for the first step must sum to 1.\n    *   Since each channel is equally probable, the probability for any single channel is $1/3$.\n\n    Therefore:\n    *   The probability of the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   The three possible intermediate states are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation (determined by $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state has no preferred orientation, the probability of decaying into any of the three available, degenerate final states must be equal.\n\n    Therefore, the total probability (which is 1) is split equally among the three possible decay channels.\n    *   Probability for each channel = $\\frac{1}{\\text{Number of available channels}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, and the probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ is correct.\n    *   C) The route is valid, but the probability $\\frac{2}{3}$ is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is valid, but the probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid path and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** We are asked to analyze the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The problem states this occurs via two successive \"dipole transitions\". This means we are looking for a cascade decay process: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole (E1) transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions and are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number $m$ must change by 0 or 1: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted by a rule, but for a spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, which means $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n3.  **Step 1: Find the Intermediate State:** Let's apply the selection rules to the first transition, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state's orbital quantum number $l'$ must be $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$. (It cannot be -1 as $l$ must be non-negative).\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ can be $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1)$. Thus, $m'$ can be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$**: The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Check the Transition from the Intermediate State to the Final State:** Now, we check if a transition from our potential intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate State candidates:** $|n'<3, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}\\rangle$.\n    *   **Final State:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta l$**: The change in $l$ would be $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is a valid change according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Check $\\Delta n$**: The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' > n_f = 1$.\n    *   **Combine conditions for n'**: From Step 1 we have $n'<3$, and from Step 2 we have $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both conditions is $n'=2$.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Decay Routes:** Based on our analysis, the intermediate state must belong to the $n=2, l=1$ subshell (the 2p subshell). There are three such states, corresponding to the possible values of $m'$. This gives us three valid decay paths:\n    *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    All the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are physically possible. The final determination rests on the probability.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The probability of a given route is the branching ratio of the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle$). The second transition, from any 2p state to the 1s state, has a probability of 1 since it's the only available dipole decay channel.\n    The key insight is that the initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no preferred direction in space. The three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) are degenerate in energy and only differ by their orientation in space (as defined by the magnetic quantum number $m'$). Since the initial state is symmetric, there is no physical reason for it to prefer decaying into one orientation over another. Therefore, the probability of decaying into each of the three available intermediate states must be equal.\n\n    *   Total number of available, equally likely decay channels for the first step = 3.\n    *   Total probability must be 1.\n    *   Probability for any single channel = $\\frac{\\text{Total Probability}}{\\text{Number of Channels}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option B is the only one that provides a valid decay route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
