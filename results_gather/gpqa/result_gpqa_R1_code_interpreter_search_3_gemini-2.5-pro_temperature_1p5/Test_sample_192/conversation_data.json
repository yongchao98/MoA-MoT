    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance.\n\n2.  **State the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax, specifically that the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* is proportional to `1/plx^5`. In mathematical terms, this is a density function and can be written as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **State the goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance *per unit range of distance*. This means we need to find the expression for `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Establish the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Use the chain rule to relate the derivatives:**\n    We want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate them using the chain rule of differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the expression `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n    Since the number of stars must be positive, we are concerned with the magnitude of this relationship, not the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases). So, we can say:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2`\n\n7.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule formula:**\n    We substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the derived proportionality for `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n8.  **Express everything in terms of distance (r):**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer in terms of `r`, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n9.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `1 / (1/r)^5` is the same as `r^5`. So the expression becomes:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes as `r^3`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:** The problem provides the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax (`plx`). Specifically, it states that the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this mathematically as:\n    \n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` \n    \n    Here, `dN` represents the number of stars in a small parallax range `d(plx)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`). Specifically, we need to find the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (`dN/dr`).\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:** The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance in astronomy is that they are inversely proportional. For small angles, the relationship is:\n    \n    `plx = 1/r`\n    \n    This also means that `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule to Change Variables:** We want to convert the derivative from being with respect to parallax (`plx`) to being with respect to distance (`r`). We can use the chain rule of differentiation:\n    \n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Conversion Factor `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n    \n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(1/r) = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    \n    The negative sign indicates that as distance (`r`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are relating the number of stars in a corresponding volume or range (which must be a positive quantity), we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. So we use the absolute value:\n    \n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Combine:** Now we substitute our known quantities back into the chain rule expression.\n    \n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    \n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance (r):** The current expression contains both `plx` and `r`. Our final answer needs to be solely in terms of `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    \n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   First, simplify the `(1/r)⁵` term in the denominator: `1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`.\n    *   Now substitute this back into the proportionality:\n        \n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   Combine the terms with `r`:\n        \n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        \n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nThis result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule of calculus to change variables.**\n    We can relate the two densities (`dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`) using the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    We need to differentiate the expression `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    The negative sign indicates that as distance (`r`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.
