    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests we are dealing with isotopes like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n    *   **B is a substance with a melting point near 277 K.** 277 K is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong match. Thus, **B = D₂O**. This confirms the heavy isotope is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n    *   **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** The release of gas and a precipitate is a common feature of the reaction between highly reactive hydrides and water. Given that D₂O is involved, it is logical to assume the reaction medium, **Y, is D₂O**.\n    *   **Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's test some possible gases.\n        *   If the gas was HD (from a reaction with normal water), it would have 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D) and 1 neutron (0 from H, 1 from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n        *   If the gas is D₂, it contains two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W. **W = D₂**.\n    *   **The reaction is X + Y(D₂O) → W(D₂) + G(precipitate).** For D₂ to be produced, the reactant X must be a deuteride. The fact that a precipitate G is formed, which on heating gives D₂O, points towards a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **X and its analog are used in organic chemistry.** This, combined with the violent reactivity, points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated version would be LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   Let's test X = LiAlD₄. The reaction with Y = D₂O is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)\n        This reaction fits all the observations:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains heavy isotope D)\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid)\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons)\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (a precipitate). When heated, 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing B=D₂O.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   **The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction is:\n        R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol).\n        The final product, the diol, contains 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both functional groups. NaBD₄, for example, is not strong enough to reduce the carboxylic acid, so it would not work.\n    *   Conclusion: **Substance X is LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride).**\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It also specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\" We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent elements and their isotopic masses:**\n        *   Lithium (Li): The most common isotope is ⁷Li. Mass = 7.\n        *   Aluminum (Al): The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass = 27.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass = 2.\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium, mass = 2).\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (mass = 27).\n    *   **Sum the masses according to the instructions:** We need to sum the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one formula unit of LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total mass from lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative (total) sum:** 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# We have identified Substance X as LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n\n# We need the masses of the specific isotopes involved.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (2H) is 2.\n# Mass number of the most common Lithium isotope (7Li) is 7.\n# Mass number of the stable Aluminum isotope (27Al) is 27.\nmasses = {'D': 2, 'Li': 7, 'Al': 27}\n\n# The elements present in LiAlD4 are H (as D), Li, and Al.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen/Deuterium with a mass of 2.\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum with a mass of 27.\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# It contains 1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n# It contains 4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements,\n# summing all instances of those elements.\ncumulative_mass = (1 * 27) + (4 * 2)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemical riddle. I will break down the clues step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Clue 1: B has a melting point near 277 K.**\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The substance with a melting point very close to this is heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   This also reveals the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Clue 2: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → W(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   Heating G gives D₂O (B). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example, M(OD)n → Metal Oxide + n/2 D₂O. So, **G is a metal deuteroxide.**\n    *   The reaction of X with Y is violent, produces a gas, and forms a metal deuteroxide. This is a classic reaction of a highly reactive hydride/deuteride with water/heavy water. Given that all products contain deuterium, it's logical to assume the reactant liquid **Y is also heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: X + D₂O → W(gas) + G(metal deuteroxide). For this to produce a deuteroxide, X must contain a metal. For it to produce a gas, it must be a deuteride that liberates Deuterium gas (D₂).\n\n3.  **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n    *   Let's test the most likely gas, Deuterium (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium (D) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n    *   Protons = Neutrons. This fits perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Clue 4: Substance X and its very close analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n    *   We know X is a metal deuteride. Its \"close analog\" would be the corresponding hydride. Common metal hydrides used as reagents in organic chemistry are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Their deuterated analogs are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction with heavy water (Y) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑\n    *   This matches all our deductions:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains the heavy isotope D)\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid)\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons)\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (a precipitate that would yield D₂O upon heating)\n        *   Analog = LiAlH₄ (a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry).\n\n5.  **Clue 5: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH + ...\n    *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). This product contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent like **LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses of the specific isotopes involved (using mass numbers for simplicity as is common in such problems):\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al). Its only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass = 27.\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D or ²H). Mass = 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li). Its most common isotope is ⁷Li. Mass = 7.\n    *   The question asks for the *cumulative* atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of *all* atoms of those elements in the formula.\n    *   In LiAlD₄:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (D): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = Mass from Al + Mass from D = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# The substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n\n# We need the masses of the specific isotopes.\n# Mass number of the heaviest element, Aluminum (27Al), is 27.\n# Mass number of the lightest element, Deuterium (2H), is 2.\n\n# The formula unit is LiAlD4.\n# It contains 1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n# It contains 4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\n# Sum of the mass of all atoms of the heaviest element + sum of the mass of all atoms of the lightest element.\nmass_of_heaviest = 1 * 27\nmass_of_lightest = 4 * 2\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_heaviest + mass_of_lightest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",

    "Based on the detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Substance B**, with a melting point near 277 K (3.85 °C), is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**, which melts at 3.82 °C.

The precipitate **G**, upon heating, releases B (D₂O), which is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing. Thus, **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n4.  The gas **W** has an equal number of protons and neutrons. The reaction between a metal deuteride and D₂O produces Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description. So, **W is D₂**.\n5.  **Substance X** and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.
