    "This problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary particle. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction and Given Information**\n\nThe decay reaction is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nThe positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²\nRest mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²\nThe rest mass of the neutrino (nu) is considered to be negligible (m_nu ≈ 0).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_i): Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is just its rest energy.\n        E_i = m_pi * c²\n    *   Final Energy (E_f): The total energy of the products is the sum of their individual total energies. The total energy (E) of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest energy (m*c²), i.e., E = KE + m*c².\n        E_f = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu * c²) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c²)\n\n    Equating initial and final energy:\n    m_pi * c² = (KE_mu + m_mu * c²) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c²)\n\n    Since m_nu ≈ 0, the equation simplifies to:\n    m_pi * c² = KE_mu + m_mu * c² + KE_nu\n\n    The sum of the kinetic energies of the products is the Q-value of the reaction:\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c² - m_mu * c²\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_i): Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n        p_i = 0\n    *   Final Momentum (p_f): The total momentum of the products is the vector sum of their momenta.\n        p_f = p_mu + p_nu\n\n    Equating initial and final momentum:\n    0 = p_mu + p_nu\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

Relate Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\n\nFor the neutrino (nu), with m_nu ≈ 0:\nE_nu² = (p*c)² + 0\nE_nu = p*c\nSince the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu = p*c\n\nFor the muon (mu+):\nE_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c²\n\n**4. Solve for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV\n2.  KE_nu = p*c\n\nLet's use an alternative approach by first calculating the momentum 'p'.\nFrom the conservation of energy:\nE_pi = E_mu + E_nu\nm_pi * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + p*c\n\nRearrange to solve for p*c:\nm_pi * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(m_pi * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²\n(m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_mu*c²)²\n\nCancel the (p*c)² term from both sides:\n(m_pi*c²)² - 2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c²)²\n\nIsolate the term with p*c:\n2*(m_pi*c²)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)²\n\nSolve for p*c:\np*c = [(m_pi*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi*c²)]\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\np*c = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\np*c = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\np*c = 8315.67 / 279.2\np*c ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    KE_nu = p*c ≈ 29.784 MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place, **KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    From the Q-value equation:\n    KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - KE_nu\n    KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.784 MeV\n    KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV\n    Rounding to two decimal places, **KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV**.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic framework. The decay of the stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu) is a classic two-body decay problem.\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the stationary pion) must equal the total energy of the products after the decay.\n    *   E_initial = m_π * c²\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + (KE_ν + m_ν * c²)\n    *   Equating them: m_π * c² = KE_μ + m_μ * c² + KE_ν (assuming the neutrino rest mass m_ν is zero).\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is: KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n**3. Solving for the Unknowns**\n\nWe can derive a general formula for the kinetic energy of the products in a two-body decay of a particle at rest. A more direct approach is to calculate the momentum `p` first.\n\nFrom conservation of energy:\nm_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\nm_π * c² = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² ) + p*c  (since for a massless neutrino, E_ν = p*c)\n\nRearranging and solving for p*c:\nm_π * c² - p*c = √( (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² )\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2(m_π * c²)(p*c)\np*c = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π*c² ]\n\nLet's plug in the given values and compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum term p*c in MeV\npc_squared = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\npc = pc_squared\n\n# Kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# For a massless particle like the neutrino, E = KE = p*c\nke_nu = pc\n\n# Kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# First find the total energy of the muon\ne_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi) # This is a shortcut formula derived from energy conservation\nke_mu = e_mu - m_mu\n\n# Alternatively, using the total KE (Q-value)\nq_value = m_pi - m_mu\nke_mu_alt = q_value - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"Momentum (pc) of each particle: {pc:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe script will calculate the momentum (multiplied by c) of the decay products and then use it to find their respective kinetic energies. The KE of the neutrino is simply equal to p*c, and the KE of the muon can be found from the conservation of energy principle. The order of the energies in the final answer options usually corresponds to the muon and then the neutrino.\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.79 MeV for the neutrino.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion) into two other particles (muon and neutrino). This process is governed by two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its total momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products after the decay must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   `p_muon = p`\n    *   `p_neutrino = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy in this relativistic problem includes both rest mass energy (`m*c^2`) and kinetic energy (KE).\n    *   **Initial Energy:** The pion is stationary, so its energy is purely its rest mass energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   **Final Energy:** The total energy of the two product particles: `E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n\n**2. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the formula: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_muon^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`): We assume the neutrino is massless (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy is simply `E_neutrino = p*c`. Since it has no rest mass, its entire energy is kinetic energy: `KE_neutrino = p*c`.\n\n**3. Set up the Energy Conservation Equation**\n\nNow we can write the energy conservation equation with all the terms:\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_muon + E_neutrino`\n`m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n**4. Solve for the Momentum (p)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown momentum `p` (or more conveniently, the term `p*c`).\n`m_pi*c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n`(m_pi*c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` term cancels out on both sides:\n`(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nNow, isolate `p*c`:\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`p*c = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet's plug in the given rest mass energies:\n*   `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n*   `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\n`p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`p*c ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    As established in step 2, for a massless neutrino, `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n    `KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n    Rounding this gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    The total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energy between the initial and final states.\n    `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n    Now we can find `KE_mu`:\n    `KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.784 MeV`\n    `KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n    Rounding this gives **4.12 MeV**.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (nu). This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
