    "A molecule exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter (chiral center) is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of CH3, C of CH2CH3).\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at several stereocenters: `(3aR, 7aS)` and the geometry of the double bond `(E)`.\n    *   The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates a specific, single stereoisomer.\n    *   The underlying framework is related to the Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, which is a meso compound (achiral). However, the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` group, which is `-CH=Cl`, introduces an unsymmetrical feature.\n    *   This substituent destroys the plane of symmetry that existed in the parent molecule, making the entire molecule chiral.\n    *   Since a specific enantiomer is designated by the name, it is a pure chiral substance and will be **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The descriptor `(2R,3S)` indicates that the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   In this configuration, the molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that lies halfway between C2 and C3, making the top half a mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The descriptor `(2R,3R)` indicates that the two stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the -OH group, is also bonded to an -H atom, a `-CH2-CH=` group, and a `-CH=CH-CH2-` group. These four groups are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule containing a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-`cis`).\n    *   Whether the OH groups are all in axial positions or all in equatorial positions, the molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (each plane containing one C-OH bond and bisecting the opposite C-C bond).\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral, even though it contains stereogenic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O, -CH2-, and -CH- groups and bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the angle between the two methyl groups.\n    *   Since the molecule lacks chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "*   **Analysis of Optical Activity**\n    A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. Common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), provided the molecule does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion which would make it an achiral meso compound. When a compound's name includes stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or is a specific named stereoisomer that is not meso, it is considered to be a single enantiomer (or diastereomer), which will be optically active.\n\n*   **Compound-by-Compound Analysis:**\n\n    1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n        *   Structure: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   Chirality: The molecule has a double bond. All the atoms connected to the double bond lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. There are no chiral centers.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n    2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n        *   Structure: The name is complex, but the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` are key.\n        *   Chirality: These descriptors specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The parent framework might be symmetrical, but the unsymmetrical substituent (`-CH=CHCl`) combined with the specific stereochemistry at the bridgehead carbons (`3aR, 7aS`) removes any potential planes of symmetry. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture.\n        *   Conclusion: The compound is a specific chiral molecule and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n    3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n        *   Structure: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n        *   Chirality: The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3S)`. This means the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule (a COOH and CH₃ on each side of the central C-C bond), this R,S configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry. This type of compound is called a meso compound.\n        *   Conclusion: Meso compounds are achiral, and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n    4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n        *   Structure: Same as above, but with different stereochemistry.\n        *   Chirality: The stereochemistry is `(2R,3R)`. Both stereocenters have the same configuration. This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n        *   Conclusion: The compound is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n    5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n        *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n        *   Chirality: The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH₂-CH= path, and (4) the -CH₂-CH=CH- path (going the other way around the ring). Since the paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n        *   Conclusion: The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n    6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n        *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n        *   Chirality: This molecule is highly symmetrical. In its preferred chair conformation (with all three OH groups equatorial), it possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and bisects the ring.\n        *   Conclusion: Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n    7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n        *   Structure: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl.\n        *   Chirality: Let's check for chiral centers. No carbon atom is attached to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH₃)₂` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All CH₂ groups in the cyclopentyl ring are equivalent with respect to their ring connections. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the carbonyl group and bisect the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n*   **Final Count:**\n    The compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n    There are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine if a compound exhibits optical activity, we need to assess its chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a stereocenter is a common feature of chiral molecules, but the molecule must lack any elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, to be chiral overall. A specific stereoisomer designated by (R), (S), or a similar notation is considered a pure substance, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: The molecule is an alkene with the formula `CH₃-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-Cl`.\n    *   Chirality: There are no stereocenters (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The plane containing the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to it acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   Structure: The name specifies the absolute configuration `(3aR, 7aS)` at two bridgehead stereocenters and the geometry `(E)` of an exocyclic double bond.\n    *   Chirality: The presence of these specific stereochemical descriptors indicates that this is a single, defined stereoisomer. The underlying framework (a norbornane derivative) is made unsymmetrical by the `-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CHCl`). This substituent destroys any plane of symmetry the parent molecule might have had. As this specific named isomer lacks internal symmetry, it is chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and is given as a single stereoisomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3).\n    *   Chirality: The notation `(2R,3S)` indicates that the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. Due to the symmetrical structure of the molecule (identical ends), this `R,S` combination results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (and a center of inversion). Such a compound is called a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: Same molecular formula as the previous compound, but different stereochemistry.\n    *   Chirality: The notation `(2R,3R)` indicates that both stereocenters have the same configuration. This diastereomer lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, existing as a pair of enantiomers (the other being the (2S,3S) isomer). Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and given as a single enantiomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Chirality: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: an -OH group, an -H atom, and two different carbon pathways around the ring (`-CH₂-CH=` vs. `-CH=CH-CH₂-`). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and given as a single enantiomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring where three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Chirality: This molecule is highly symmetrical.
