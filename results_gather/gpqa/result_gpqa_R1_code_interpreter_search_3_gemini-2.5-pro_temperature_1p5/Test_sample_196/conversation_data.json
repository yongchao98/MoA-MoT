The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** We need to piece together the structure from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) mentioned above.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nWe will analyze the provided spectroscopic data (IR and ¹H NMR) to determine the structure of Compound X.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which, combined with the O-H signal, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This extremely downfield, broad singlet is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region show a pattern typical of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's assemble the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-). It is a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent -CH₃ group (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH- group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine proton (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). It's a multiplet because it is split by the adjacent -CH₃ (at 1.4 ppm) and -CH₂- (at 1.7 ppm) groups.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** By putting the pieces together, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), we identify the group as a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *Conclusion for Compound X:* Combining all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n**2. The Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and HI (Hydroiodic acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carbonyl and carboxyl groups to alkanes. Specifically, it will reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The saturated sec-butyl group and the stable aromatic ring will not be affected by these reagents.\n\n**3. Predicting the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group attached in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring. The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The starting material is different and the reaction is a reduction.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This matches the predicted final product.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>",
