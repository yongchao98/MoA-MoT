    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (or Stereocenter):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation about a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism) or allenes.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure Type:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n*   **Rotation:** Generally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond: 2, 2', 6, and 6'), this rotation can be restricted due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Substituents:** In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO₂) at positions 6 and 6'. This severe steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar and restricts rotation around the central C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality:** Because of the restricted rotation, the molecule is locked into a non-planar conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Common Name:** Methyl lactate.\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's look at the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH). We need to identify the four groups attached to this carbon:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `(C₆H₅)₂C=O`. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, as it forms a double bond with oxygen. It is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen atom and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole needs to be checked for symmetry elements.\n*   **Symmetry:** The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond, regardless of the twisting of the phenyl rings. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule's mirror image superimposable on the original.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃` with the two `-COOCH₃` groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** Dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (*cis*-isomer), is also achiral as it has a plane of symmetry).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Achiral, no optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral, no optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as in some biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Analysis:** Rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large (bulky) substituent groups at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond, i.e., 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule into a specific, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** Because of this locked conformation and the substitution pattern, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** We need to examine the carbon atoms for any chiral centers. Let's look at the second carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. The groups attached to C2 are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of a chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is two phenyl rings attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), i.e., (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized because of the double bond to oxygen. It is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom), so it cannot be a chiral center. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Chirality:** The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** (not chiral) because its mirror image is identical and superimposable. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers.\n*   **Chirality:** This molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always **achiral**. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Is chiral (atropisomerism) -> shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Is chiral (chiral center) -> shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Is achiral (plane of symmetry) -> does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Is achiral (center of symmetry) -> does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will rotate the plane of polarized light. Chirality typically arises from a chiral center or from axial/planar chirality due to restricted rotation (atropisomerism).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single bond. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the large size of these ortho-substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of stereoisomerism is called **atropisomerism**. Because the molecule is chiral, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings, with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three entities (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of an alkene dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond. Any molecule possessing a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to assess whether their molecular structures are chiral.

The two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. Normally, there is free rotation around this bond. However, this molecule has large, bulky groups (nitro groups, -NO₂, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups collide with each other, severely restricting rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two rings into a stable, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** Because the molecule is locked in a twisted shape and the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.
