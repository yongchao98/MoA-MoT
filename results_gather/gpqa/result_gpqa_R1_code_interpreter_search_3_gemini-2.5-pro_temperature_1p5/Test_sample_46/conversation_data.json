    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is consistent with an ester group (C=O) that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. Conjugation lowers the stretching frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent on the ring is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet at a very downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified from the IR spectrum. Amine protons often appear as broad signals because of rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   We have the following pieces:\n    1.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    2.  An ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃)\n    3.  A carbonyl group (C=O)\n    4.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\n*   Combining the ethoxy and carbonyl fragments suggests an ethyl ester group: -C(=O)OCH₂CH₃.\n*   The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amine group (-NH₂) and the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group is electron-donating, so it will shield its ortho protons, making them appear more upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n*   The ester group is electron-withdrawing, so it will deshield its ortho protons, making them appear more downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n*   Putting all the pieces together in a 1,4-arrangement gives the structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification**\n\n*   **Formula Check:** C₆H₄(NH₂)(COOCH₂CH₃) = C₉H₁₁NO₂. This matches.\n*   **Spectra Check:** All IR and NMR features are perfectly explained by the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, leading to a different NMR shift for the CH₂.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches the deduced structure perfectly.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (1,3-meta) and functional groups (amide, ether).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band is from the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is from the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl stretching region. The frequency is slightly lower than a typical saturated ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹), which is characteristic of an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet at a very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of an ester or ether. Given the IR data, an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is highly likely.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both being doublets and each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts (1.0 ppm) means one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for two protons corresponds to the protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group. The broadness is due to quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   From the data, we have identified three pieces:\n        1.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n        2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n        3.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n    *   The amine group is electron-donating and would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    *   The ethyl ester group is electron-withdrawing and would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be deshielded (appear downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n    *   Putting all these pieces together, we get ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is an amide, not an ester/amine. The IR and NMR would be different.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂C=O), not the alcohol part. The methylene quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the primary amine, the ethyl ester group, and the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring pattern.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has the wrong functional groups (amide and ether) and the wrong substitution pattern (1,3-meta), which would produce a more complex NMR spectrum in the aromatic region.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). This value indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong clue for the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands of medium-to-strong intensity in the N-H stretching region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a definitive sign of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is slightly lower than that of a simple saturated ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹), which indicates that the carbonyl group is **conjugated** with a double bond or, as suggested by the DoU, an aromatic ring. This points towards an **aromatic ester**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down the signals piece by piece:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)** pattern.\n    *   The 3H signal at 1.20 ppm is a triplet (t), meaning it's adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This is the methyl (-CH₃) part.\n    *   The 2H signal at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q), meaning it's adjacent to a -CH₃ group. This is the methylene (-CH₂-) part.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the ester group suggested by the IR data. This confirms an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   Having two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the characteristic pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The two substituents on the ring are different. One is electron-donating, causing the protons next to it to be shielded and appear upfield (at 7.0 ppm). The other is electron-withdrawing, causing the protons next to it to be deshielded and appear downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for two protons is characteristic of the protons on the primary **amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is caused by chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Structure**\n\nWe have the following fragments:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂)\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nThe amine group is electron-donating, and the ester group is electron-withdrawing. Attaching these to a benzene ring in the 1 and 4 positions gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure perfectly fits all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n*   **IR:** -NH₂ bands and conjugated ester C=O band (Correct)\n*   **¹H NMR:** The para-substituted ring pattern, the amine protons, and the ethyl ester protons all match their expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - The ethyl group is in the wrong part of the ester, which would change the NMR signals significantly.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Matches our derived structure perfectly.**\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether) and substitution pattern (meta).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step elucidation of the unknown compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring itself and 3 for the pi bonds) plus one additional double bond or ring. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this extra degree of unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.

This points towards an aromatic ester.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This combination of a triplet (t) for 3 protons and a quartet (q) for 2 protons is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl**, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The large difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons and shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons and shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a typical signal for the two protons of a primary **amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is caused by chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Putting It All Together**\n\nWe have identified the following structural fragments:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂) - which is an electron-donating group.\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) - which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\nPlacing the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring satisfies all the data. The protons next to the donating amine group appear upfield (7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the withdrawing ester group appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\nThe resulting structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Final Check against Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide and ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), and its -CH₂- signal would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide and ether) and substitution pattern (meta, not para).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a systematic analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.

The frequency is slightly lower than that of a standard saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), which indicates that the carbonyl group is **conjugated** with the aromatic ring. This strongly suggests the presence of an **aromatic ester**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl (-CH₃) group, split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH₂- group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene (-CH₂-) group, split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH₃ group.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) signifies that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester.

A benzene ring that is 1,4-disubstituted by these two groups.\n\nPlacing the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group at opposite ends (the 1 and 4 positions) of the benzene ring fits all the data. The protons ortho (next) to the amine are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\nThe final structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived structure to the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester type; would give a different NMR signal for the CH₂ group.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all analytical data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups (amide, ether) and substitution pattern (meta, not para).\n\n<<<C>>>"
