    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a closed system with a conservative force like the one described by Hooke's Law, the total energy of the system is constant.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy in a relativistic context.**\n    The total energy (E_total) of a particle moving in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy (E_particle) and its potential energy (U).\n    The particle's energy is given by E_particle = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    Alternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, the total energy can be seen as the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (K) and the potential energy (U).\n    K = (γ - 1)mc²\n    The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's Law (F = -kx) is U(x) = (1/2)kx², assuming U=0 at the equilibrium position x=0.\n    Therefore, the conserved total energy is:\n    E_total = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two specific points in the oscillation.**\n    The total energy must be the same at every point in the particle's path. Let's consider two points where the calculation is simplest:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At this point, x = A. The mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is v = 0.\n        When v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        The kinetic energy K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n        The potential energy U = (1/2)kA².\n        So, the total energy of the system is E_total = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA².\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At this point, x = 0. The potential energy is at its minimum (U=0), and the speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum, γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        The kinetic energy is K = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n        The potential energy U = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n        So, the total energy at this point is E_total = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy expressions and solve for v_max.**\n    Since total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 equals the energy at Point 2:\n    (1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²\n\n5.  **Isolate the Lorentz factor, γ_max.**\n    Divide both sides by mc²:\n    (γ_max - 1) = (kA²) / (2mc²)\n    Add 1 to both sides:\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n6.  **Substitute the definition of γ_max and solve for v_max.**\n    Recall that γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n    To solve for v_max, we first invert both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n\n    Now, square both sides:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, multiply by c² and take the square root to find v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²]\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for v_max is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option D exactly.\n\nAs a quick check, in the non-relativistic limit (where the potential energy is much smaller than the rest energy, i.e., kA² << mc²), the term (kA²)/(2mc²) becomes very small. Using the binomial approximation (1+x)^n ≈ 1+nx, our formula correctly reduces to the classical result v_max = √(kA²/m). This confirms the validity of our relativistic derivation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the conservation of energy. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Principle of Conservation of Energy**\nFor a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. The total energy (E_total) is the sum of the kinetic energy (K) and the potential energy (U).\nE_total = K + U = constant\n\n**2. Defining the Energies in a Relativistic Context**\n*   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, F = -kx. The potential energy stored in the spring is the integral of the force over the displacement, so U(x) = (1/2)kx².\n*   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** Unlike the classical K = (1/2)mv², the relativistic kinetic energy is given by K = (γ - 1)mc², where 'm' is the rest mass, 'c' is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nSo, the total conserved energy of the system at any point is:\nE_total = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy at Key Points**\nWe can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n*   **Point A (Maximum Displacement):** At the maximum amplitude (x = A), the mass momentarily stops.\n    *   x = A\n    *   v = 0\n    *   Since v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n    *   The kinetic energy K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n    *   The potential energy U = (1/2)kA².\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is **E_total = (1/2)kA²**.\n\n*   **Point B (Equilibrium Position):** At the equilibrium position (x = 0), the potential energy is zero, and the mass reaches its maximum speed (v = v_max).\n    *   x = 0\n    *   v = v_max\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum: γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    *   The kinetic energy K = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n    *   The potential energy U = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is **E_total = (γ_max - 1)mc²**.\n\n**4. Solving for v_max**\nSince total energy is conserved, we can set the energy at Point A equal to the energy at Point B:\n(1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for v_max. First, let's isolate γ_max:\nγ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)\nγ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\nNext, substitute the definition of γ_max:\n1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\nTo solve for v_max, let's invert both sides:\n√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\nRearrange the terms to isolate v_max²/c²:\nv_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\nFinally, multiply by c² and take the square root of both sides to find v_max:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The key principle to use here is the conservation of total energy.\n\n**1.

Apply Conservation of Energy at Two Key Points**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, we can equate the total energy at two different points in the oscillator's path. The most convenient points are the point of maximum displacement and the equilibrium point.\n\n*   **At the point of maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    *   The mass momentarily stops, so its speed is v = 0.\n    *   When v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n    *   The kinetic energy K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum, U_max = (1/2)kA².\n    *   The total energy at this point is E_total = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA².\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    *   The potential energy is zero, U = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n    *   The speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum, K_max = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n    *   The total energy at this point is E_total = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n\n**3. Solve for the Maximum Speed (v_max)**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\nE_total (at x=A) = E_total (at x=0)\n(1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²\n\nNow, we solve this equation for v_max. First, isolate γ_max:\nγ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)\nγ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\nSubstitute the definition of γ_max back into the equation:\n1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\nTo solve for v_max, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n1.  Invert both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n\n2.  Square both sides to remove the square root:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n3.  Rearrange the equation to isolate the v_max term:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n4.  Multiply by c² and take the square root to find the final expression for v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²]\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
