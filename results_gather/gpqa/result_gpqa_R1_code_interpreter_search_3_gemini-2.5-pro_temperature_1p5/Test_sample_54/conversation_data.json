    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values from the 1H NMR data are 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n    Now let's determine the number of protons for each possible compound:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3): The chemical formula is C5H8O2. It has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., But-1-enyl acetate, CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3): The chemical formula is C6H10O2. It has 3+2+1+1+3 = 10 protons.\n    Since the NMR data indicates 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the key coupling constant (J value) to determine stereochemistry (cis vs. trans).**\n    The problem provides a signal at 7.0 ppm which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz. This signal corresponds to one of the protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The splitting into a doublet is caused by coupling to the other proton on the double bond.\n    The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is highly diagnostic of the geometry:\n    *   A **trans** arrangement leads to a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   A **cis** arrangement leads to a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** is a classic value for a **trans** double bond. This allows us to eliminate Cis-propenyl acetate (D).\n\n*   **Step 3: Assign all signals to the proposed structure (Trans-propenyl acetate).**\n    Let's verify that all the data fits the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    ```\n        H(b)  O-CO-CH3(d)\n          \\   /\n           C=C\n          /   \\\n        H(a)  CH3(c)\n    (trans configuration)\n    ```\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. It corresponds to the acetate methyl protons (labeled **d**), which have no adjacent protons to couple with. This fits.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet integrating to 3 protons. It corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond (labeled **c**). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton (H**a**). This fits.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a signal for one proton, split into a doublet of quartets. It corresponds to the vinyl proton H**a**. It is split into a **d**oublet by the other vinyl proton (H**b**) and into a **q**uartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (H**c**). This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for one proton, split into a doublet. It corresponds to the vinyl proton H**b**. It is split into a doublet by H**a** with the characteristic large trans-coupling constant. It has a higher chemical shift (is more deshielded) because it is attached to the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom. This fits perfectly.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is an excellent question that requires a systematic analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to deduce the correct chemical structure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Total Number of Protons\nFirst, let's determine the total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the unknown molecule by summing the integration values from the NMR spectrum.\nIntegration = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = **8 protons**\n\nNow, let's find the total number of protons in each of the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The structure is CH₃–CH=CH–O–CO–CH₃. The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. The number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **8 H**.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** A possible structure is CH₃CH₂–CH=CH–O–CO–CH₃. The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. The number of protons is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **10 H**.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since the NMR spectrum indicates a total of 8 protons, we can confidently eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the Coupling Constant (J)\nThe key to distinguishing between Cis and Trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (–CH=CH–).\n\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This signal corresponds to one of the protons on the double bond.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinyl protons is highly diagnostic of the geometry:\n    *   **Trans coupling (¹H-C=C-¹H, trans):** Typically has a large J value, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (¹H-C=C-¹H, cis):** Typically has a smaller J value, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** is a classic value for a **trans** double bond. This allows us to eliminate Cis-propenyl acetate (D).\n\n### Step 3: Assign all Signals to Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate\nThe only remaining possibility is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's assign all the signals in the spectrum to this structure to ensure a perfect match.\n\n**Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate**\n```\n     H(b)   O\n      \\   //\n       C==C--O--C--CH₃(d)\n      /   \\\n    H(a)  CH₃(c)\n```\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group **(d)**. These protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet. This is a very characteristic chemical shift for an acetate group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond **(c)**. These protons are coupled to the single adjacent proton H**(a)**, splitting the signal into a doublet.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the proton H**(a)**. It is split into a **q**uartet by the three adjacent methyl protons **(c)**, and further split into a **d**oublet by the trans proton H**(b)**. This complex splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This doublet corresponds to the proton H**(b)**. It is on the carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen, which deshields it and shifts it far downfield to 7.0 ppm. It is coupled only to the proton H**(a)**, splitting its signal into a doublet with the large, characteristic trans coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\nAll features of the 1H NMR spectrum are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>",

It is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom, which shifts it downfield. It is split into a doublet by proton **(a)** with the characteristic large trans-coupling constant.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to proton **(a)**. It is split into a **d**oublet by the trans proton **(b)** (J ≈ 16 Hz) and into a **q**uartet by the three adjacent methyl protons **(c)** (J ≈ 7 Hz).
