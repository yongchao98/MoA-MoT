    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to its natural isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) as it does not typically couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other's signals into doublets.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. While it has an O-H group (phenolic) and a C=O group, it would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm (the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm). The aromatic region would also be more complex than two doublets.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the 4 aromatic protons, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound's structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** Molecular weight is 156 (for ³⁵Cl) and 158 (for ³⁷Cl), matching the MS.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which gives the characteristic 'two doublets, 2H each' pattern seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires interpreting several types of spectroscopic data. I will analyze each piece of information step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule using the most common isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 which is two mass units heavier. The intensity of this peak is 32% relative to the molecular ion peak (100%). The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine (Cl) atom in the molecule, as chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which have a mass difference of 2 amu and an abundance ratio of roughly 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad signal is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes this peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This intense absorption is in the typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. The frequency is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal appearing far downfield, in the 10-13 ppm range, is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration of 1H confirms it represents a single proton, and it appears as a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted** (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. In this arrangement, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of equivalent protons split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\nBased on the analysis, we are looking for a compound that is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the 11.0 ppm signal in the NMR. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR signals for the aldehyde proton and the substitution pattern would be different. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has the correct functional group (carboxylic acid) and molecular formula. However, it is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring.\n    *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The MW for the ³⁵Cl isotope is 7*12 + 5*1 + 35.5 + 2*16 ≈ 156.5, which matches the m/z = 156 peak. It has one chlorine atom, matching the isotope pattern.\n    *   **IR:** It contains a carboxylic acid group, matching the IR spectrum.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, matching the NMR data perfectly.\n\nTherefore, all the evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a structural elucidation problem that requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Isotope Peaks:** The base peak is the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156. There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (two mass units higher) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺ to M⁺+2 peak ratio of 100:32 is characteristic of a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine's isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), which have a ratio of approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules causes the peak to be very broad, often obscuring other nearby peaks.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This intense absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Multiplicity & Integration:** It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the presence of one carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift & Integration:** These signals are in the aromatic region, and their combined integration (2H + 2H) indicates there are four protons on a benzene ring. This means the ring is disubstituted.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** The pattern of two doublets is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In this arrangement, the molecule possesses symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons are adjacent and split each other's signals into doublets.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nCombining all the data, we are looking for a compound that is a **chlorobenzoic acid** with a **1,4 (para) substitution pattern**.\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the substitution pattern is different.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct**. This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   It contains one chlorine atom and its molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol, matching the MS data.\n    *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, matching the aromatic 'two doublets' pattern in the ¹H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>",
