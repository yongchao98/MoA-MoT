    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically dealing with time dilation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**.

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   The problem involves two \"inertial frames of reference\" moving at a very high speed relative to each other. The speed, 60,000 km/s, is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). This indicates that the principles of Special Relativity must be used, rather than classical (Newtonian) physics.\n*   We are given a time interval measured in one frame (the \"moving\" frame of the ejecta) and asked to find a distance traveled in the other frame (the \"stationary\" frame of the Galaxy).\n*   The key principle here is **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events happening in a moving frame compared to the time measured by an observer in the moving frame itself.\n*   The time measured in the moving object's own frame is called the **proper time** (`Δt₀`).\n*   The time measured by the stationary observer is the **dilated time** (`Δt`).\n*   The formula connecting these is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   The distance measured in the stationary frame is simply the velocity multiplied by the time measured in that same stationary frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   Frame 1 (Stationary): The Galaxy (let's call it frame S).\n*   Frame 2 (Moving): The supernova ejecta (let's call it frame S').\n*   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame): `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light: `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Define the Goal**\n\n*   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation**\n\n1.  First, calculate the dilated time (`Δt`) in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula.\n2.  To do this, we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n3.  Once we have the dilated time `Δt`, we can calculate the distance `d` using `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**5. Execute the Calculation (using a script for precision)**\n\nLet's use Python to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Velocity of the ejecta (v) in km/s\nv = 60000\n\n# Proper time (dt0) measured in the ejecta's frame, in seconds\ndt0 = 50\n\n# Speed of light (c) in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculation Steps ---\n# 1.

Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\n*   The calculated distance is `3,061,862.15 km`.\n*   Let's review the options provided:\n    A) 2,940,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 3,060,000 km\n    D) 3,000,000 km\n\n*   Our calculated value is extremely close to option C. The difference is negligible and likely due to rounding in the problem's options. Option D represents the incorrect classical calculation (`60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`), which ignores the effects of time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves a very high velocity (60,000 km/s) which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). This tells us that we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`) directly. We must apply the principles of Einstein's Special Relativity.\n*   **Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The \"stationary\" frame: The Galaxy. Let's call this frame S. We want to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n    *   The \"moving\" frame: The supernova ejecta. Let's call this frame S'.\n*   **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock), `Δt' = 50 s`. In relativity, the time measured in an object's own moving frame is called the **proper time**, denoted as `Δt₀`. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n*   **Apply the Correct Relativistic Principle:** The key concept is **time dilation**. An observer in the stationary frame (S) will see time passing more slowly for the moving frame (S'). Therefore, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\n*   **Formulate the Equations:**\n    1.  The time dilation formula relates the two time intervals: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    2.  The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    3.  The distance in the Galaxy frame is calculated using the time measured in the Galaxy frame: `d = v * Δt`\n*   **Plan the Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    2.  Use `γ` to find the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    3.  Use `Δt` to calculate the distance `d`.\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nTo perform the calculation with high precision, we can use a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Relative velocity in km/s\nv = 60000\n# Proper time in the ejecta's frame, in seconds\ndt0 = 50\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 300000\n\n# --- Calculation steps ---\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n#    gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v / c)**2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the dilated time (dt) in the Galaxy's frame\n#    dt = gamma * dt0\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# 3. Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame\n#    d = v * dt\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance} km\")\n```\n\nThe result of this calculation is approximately `3,061,862.15 km`.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our calculated distance (`3,061,862.15 km`) with the given options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.
