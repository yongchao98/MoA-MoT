    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial and final states.**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial total energy E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum P_i = 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies T1 and T2 and momenta p1 and p2.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses (or rest-mass energies) of the fragments.**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find m1:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial rest-mass energy:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * M * c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * M * c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n*   `Q = E_i - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest (P_i = 0), the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    *   `p1 = p2`\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) is related to momentum (p) by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / (2*m1)) / (p2^2 / (2*m2))`\n    *   Since p1=p2, this simplifies to `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   We know `m1 = 2 * m2`, so `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`  or  `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Now we use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the correct T1 using relativistic mechanics.**\n\n*   Conservation of momentum `p1 = p2` still holds.\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c^2) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   From this, we can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since p1 = p2, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`, which means:\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Conservation of energy states that the total energy is conserved. The initial total energy was `M*c^2`. The final total energy is `E1 + E2`.\n    *   `E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   This gives us `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Now substitute E2 and the rest-mass energies into the momentum equation:\n    *   `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    *   `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1^2` terms cancel out:\n    *   `-39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801`\n*   Solve for E1:\n    *   `600*E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n    *   `600*E1 = 119403`\n    *   `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`\n    *   `T1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the difference.**\n\n*   The correct (relativistic) value is `T1 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The classical approximation value is `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   The difference is `ΔT1 = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV.

    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-Value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments in terms of the initial energy.\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, so `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n2.  Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow convert these to energy:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (m2): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n*   `Q = (Total Kinetic Energy) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momentum (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Classical Relation:** In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T1 / T2 = (p1^2 / 2*m1) / (p2^2 / 2*m2)`. Since `p1=p2`, this simplifies to `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.

Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum** still holds (`p1 = p2`), which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Relation:** The relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass energy (`m*c^2`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. This can be rearranged to `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Equating the momenta: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** `E_initial = E1 + E2`, so `300 GeV = E1 + E2`, which means `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   **Solve for E1 (total energy of the massive fragment):**\n    *   Substitute the values into the momentum equation:\n        `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n        `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n    *   The `E1^2` terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for `E1`:\n        `600*E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n        `600*E1 = 119403`\n        `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   **Solve for T1_correct:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T1_correct = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, we need to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given two pieces of information:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let their rest-mass energies be `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`. We can write this relationship as: `m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy (`Mc^2 = 300 GeV`): `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we solve this system of two equations:\n1.

Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal magnitudes of momentum and travel in opposite directions (`p1 = p2`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Ratio of Energies:** We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p1^2 / 2m1) / (p2^2 / 2m2)`. Since `p1 = p2`, this simplifies to `m2 / m1`.\n    The mass ratio `m2/m1` is the same as the rest-energy ratio `m2c^2 / m1c^2`, which is `99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n    So, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   **Solve for T1_classical:**\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (`p1 = p2`)** and the **relativistic energy-momentum relation** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` gives us `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy** states that the initial energy equals the sum of the final total energies (rest + kinetic): `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`. We can write `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values into the momentum equation:\n    `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1^2` terms cancel. Rearrange the equation to solve for `E1`:\n    `600 * E1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n    `600 * E1 = 119403`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1c^2`:\n    `T1_correct = E1 - m1c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classically approximated value is:\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nThe question's options are in MeV, so we convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
