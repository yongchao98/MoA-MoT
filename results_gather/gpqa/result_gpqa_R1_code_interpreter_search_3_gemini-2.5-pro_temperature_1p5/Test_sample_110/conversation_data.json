    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at its α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate will then attack the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to find the acidic α-protons (hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to the carbonyl C1, ring C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to the carbonyl C1, ring C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single possible enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate, now acting as a nucleophile, attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a saturated `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule retains the cyclohexanone ring structure with the original substituents.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   At C2: an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   At C6: a methyl group and the newly added `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   To name the product according to the options provided (as a derivative of ethyl propanoate), we consider the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part as the parent chain.\n        *   Parent name: `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered C1.\n        *   **C1 (original C6):** Has a methyl group. So, we have a `1-methyl` group.\n        *   **C2 (original C1):** This is the carbonyl carbon. So, we have a `2-oxo` group.\n        *   **C3 (original C2):** Has an ethyl and a methyl group. So, we have a `3-ethyl` and a `3-methyl` group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion. This anion is the nucleophile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has two acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the NO₂ group.\n    *   KOH removes one of these protons to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The product structure after the attack and protonation (by H₂O) is:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the carbon of the nitrile (-CN) group, which is the principal functional group.\n    *   The longest chain is 6 carbons long: `CN-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   **C1:** Nitrile group. The parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n        *   **C3:** Has a methyl group substituent (`3-methyl`).\n        *   **C4:** Has a nitro group substituent (`4-nitro`).\n    *   Combining these parts, the full name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) creates a nucleophile from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate.\n    *   We must identify the available α-protons. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon, meaning it has no protons attached. Therefore, no enolate can form at C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. This is the only acidic α-proton available for abstraction.\n    *   t-BuOK will deprotonate the C6 position to form a single, specific enolate ion. The negative charge is localized on C6, making it the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate's nucleophilic C6 attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (`CH₂=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system (the `CH₂` group in ethyl acrylate).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon single bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   After the reaction and workup (protonation), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a saturated `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` chain attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: an ethyl and a methyl group at C2; a methyl group at C6.\n    *   To name the product as given in the options (as a derivative of ethyl propanoate), the `ethyl...propanoate` part is the parent structure. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's name the complex substituent. According to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as carbon 1.\n        *   **C1 (original C6):** Attached to the propanoate and has a methyl group. -> `1-methyl`.\n        *   **C2 (original C1):** Contains the carbonyl group. -> `2-oxo`.\n        *   **C3 (original C2):** Contains an ethyl and a methyl group. -> `3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of Product A is therefore **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. The base (KOH) creates a nucleophile from the nitroalkane, which attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.\n    *   KOH, a strong base, removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The double bond is reduced, and after protonation by water (`H₂O`), the final product is formed.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we follow IUPAC nomenclature. The nitrile (`-CN`) group is the principal functional group and determines the suffix of the name. Its carbon is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is 6 carbons long. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain from C1 (the nitrile carbon) and locate the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group (`-CH₃`) is on carbon 3. -> `3-methyl`.\n        *   A nitro group (`-NO₂`) is on carbon 4. -> `4-nitro`.\n    *   The full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these derived names with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOption **A** correctly identifies the structures of both major products.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The ring carbon attached to the parent chain (the original C6) is numbered as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (original C6):** Has a `methyl` group attached.\n        *   **Position 2 (original C1):** Contains the carbonyl, so it's an `oxo` group.\n        *   **Position 3 (original C2):** Contains an `ethyl` group and a `methyl` group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   This substituent is located on carbon 3 of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is another Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane to create a nucleophile, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂–NO₂`). The protons on the carbon directly bonded to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, removes an α-proton to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH–NO₂]⁻`. The α-carbon acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃–CH=CH–CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting molecular skeleton is `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂))–(CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)`.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   To name the final product, `CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`, we follow IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The nitrile (`–CN`) group is the principal functional group, so its carbon is C1 and the name will end in `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest continuous carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. The parent alkane is hexane, making the parent name **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1) to locate the substituents:\n        *   A **methyl** group (`–CH₃`) is on carbon 3.\n        *   A **nitro** group (`–NO₂`) is on carbon 4.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the full name for **Product B**: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these determined structures with the given options, only option A provides the correct names for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
