    "This problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a substituted δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer. The chiral center is at the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name to understand its structure.\n    *   \"Pentanoic acid\" implies a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   \"3-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) on the third carbon. This carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes the group at the end of the chain (C5). This corresponds to an isobutyl ester group (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   So, the structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid:\n        **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu**\n    This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). This chiral center in the starting material will become the chiral center at C4 in the final lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents' Selectivity**\n\nThis is the key to solving the problem. The two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a nucleophilic reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is an electrophilic reducing agent. It has a strong preference for reducing carboxylic acids, doing so much more rapidly than it reduces esters.\n\n**3. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Since LiBH₄ is used, the **ester group** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH (+ iBuOH)\n        The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester's carbonyl carbon, and the cyclization involves the carboxylic acid carbon. Neither of these reactions affects the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Since BH₃ is used, the **carboxylic acid group** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + BH₃  →  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n        The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction occurs at the carboxylic acid's carbon, not the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of the starting material is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the General Reaction Scheme**\n\nBoth reactions start with a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid and end with a 4-ethyl-lactone. Let's analyze the structures involved.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The general structure is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). There is an ethyl group at C3, which is a chiral center.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl`\n    *   This molecule has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl).\n*   **Product:** The product is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\". This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4, which is the same chiral center from the starting material.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing O at position 1, a carbonyl (C=O) at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.\n\n**2. Understand the Key Chemical Transformation**\n\nTo form the lactone, one of the two carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This newly formed alcohol then undergoes an intramolecular reaction (cyclization) with the remaining carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Path 1:** The ester is reduced to an alcohol. The alcohol then reacts with the carboxylic acid (intramolecular esterification or lactonization).\n*   **Path 2:** The carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol. The alcohol then reacts with the ester (intramolecular transesterification).\n\nThe choice between these two pathways depends entirely on the reducing agent used.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. The two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n\n*   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** LiBH₄ is a nucleophilic reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters and ketones but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids. The reason is that the hydridic LiBH₄ first deprotonates the acidic carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (-COO⁻), which is resistant to further nucleophilic attack by the hydride.\n    *   **Conclusion for LiBH₄:** It will selectively reduce the **ester** group.\n\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** BH₃ (usually complexed with THF) is an electrophilic reducing agent. It has a very high affinity for electron-rich carbonyls and reacts extremely rapidly with carboxylic acids. Its reaction with esters is much slower.\n    *   **Conclusion for BH₃:** It will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n        `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu)` → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 with the ethyl group). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Result:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n        `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu)` → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    2.  The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is unaffected. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Result:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Since the chemical reactions do not occur at the chiral center itself, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of this center will be retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent Selectivity:**\n    *   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This is a moderately strong, nucleophilic reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It reacts with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`), which is resistant to further reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** This is a strong, electrophilic reducing agent. It has a very high preference for reducing carboxylic acids, reacting with them much faster than with esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.
