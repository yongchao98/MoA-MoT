    "H2PO4- is an amphiprotic species. It can act as a base by accepting a proton or as an acid by donating a proton. The same applies to HPO4^2-.\n\nIn this solution we have a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This constitutes a buffer solution. The pH of this buffer solution is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\nThe relevant equilibria are:\n\n1) H2PO4^-(aq) ⇌ H^+(aq) + HPO4^2-(aq)      Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8\n2) HPO4^2-(aq) ⇌ H^+(aq) + PO4^3-(aq)      Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n\nFirst, let's calculate the molar concentrations of the solutes.\n\nVolume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\nMass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\nMass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\nThe dissociation of KH2PO4 in water gives K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The dissociation of Na2HPO4●2H2O in water gives 2Na+ and HPO4^2- ions and 2 H2O.\n\nMoles of H2PO4^- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nNow we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation step of H3PO4 to calculate the pH of the solution.\npH = pKa2 + log ([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\npH = -log(6.2x10^-8) + log (0.02809/0.03674) = 7.2076 + (-0.1166) = 7.091\nSo, [H^+] = 10^-7.091 = 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\nThe orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO4^3-], is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (2), for which the equilibrium constant is Ka3.\nKa3 = [H^+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H^+]\n\nThe concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- are much larger than the concentration of PO4^3- and H3PO4, so we can assume that their concentrations are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.11x10^-8) = 6.24 x 10^-7 M\n\nFinal Answer is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nLet's do the calculations in a more accurate way with a python script:\n```python\n# Molar masses\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\n\n# Masses\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\n\n# Volume\nvolume_L = 0.200\n\n# Ka values\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Moles\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# We have the buffer equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]\n# We can calculate [H+] from this buffer system.\n# We can assume that the change in concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- is negligible.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# The concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is governed by the third equilibrium:\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# Substitute [H+] from the first calculation:\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / (Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-])\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]^2 / (Ka2 * [H2PO4-])\n\n# Alternative, more direct approach after calculating [H+]:\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nPO4_conc = Ka3 * conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"Concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_H2PO4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_HPO4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of H+ = {H_plus_conc:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"Concentration of PO4^3- = {PO4_conc:.2e} M\")\n```\nConcentration of H2PO4- = 0.0367 M\nConcentration of HPO4^2- = 0.0281 M\nConcentration of H+ = 8.11e-08 M\nConcentration of PO4^3- = 6.24e-07 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem and provide the final answer. I have already performed the reasoning and calculation in the previous turn.\n\n**Summary of my reasoning:**\n1.

Recognize that this is a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸).\n3.  Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the Ka2 expression. We assume the initial concentrations of the buffer components are close to their equilibrium concentrations.\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * [H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n4.  The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹²).\n5.  Calculate the [PO4³⁻] using the Ka3 expression and the previously calculated [H⁺].\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value 6.24x10⁻⁷ M matches option C.

Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n2.  Use the second dissociation constant (Ka₂) for phosphoric acid to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer.\n3.  Use the third dissociation constant (Ka₃) and the calculated [H⁺] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\nThe calculation yields:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
