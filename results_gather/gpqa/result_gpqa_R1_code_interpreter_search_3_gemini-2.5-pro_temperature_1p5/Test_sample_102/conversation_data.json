    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution is crucial:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe main challenge in this synthesis is the presence of the bromo group (-Br), an *o,p*-director, in a *meta* position relative to the other two groups. This suggests that a straightforward sequence of substitutions might not work or that a more complex strategy involving modification or removal of directing groups is necessary.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong *o,p*-director.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-), which is strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing. Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail on such deactivated rings. Even if it were to proceed, the subsequent steps would not lead to the desired product due to the directing effects. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt (via NaNO2/HCl)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (deamination using H3PO2).\nThis sequence of steps (i-iv) starts with benzene and returns to benzene, which makes no sense in a synthetic route. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product)\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by both a nitro group and a bromine atom. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings that are this deactivated. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`\nThis sequence is more complex and involves using a group as a placeholder, which is later removed. This is a common strategy to overcome unfavorable directing effects. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone.**\n    This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **ii) Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    The -COCH3 group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3). This step is correct.\n\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Mixture including 1-(5-Bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The -COCH3 group at C1 is *m*-directing, while the -Br group at C3 is *o,p*-directing. This leads to a mixture of products. The least sterically hindered and electronically favored product is 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethanone, which is named 1-(5-bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone by IUPAC rules. We will carry this major product forward.\n\n*   **iv) 1-(5-Bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone --(Fe/HCl)--> 1-(2-Amino-5-bromophenyl)ethanone.**\n    The nitro group at C2 is selectively reduced to an amino group (-NH2). The amino group is a powerful *o,p*-director.\n\n*   **v) 1-(2-Amino-5-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(2-Amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone.**\n    This is the crucial step. We nitrate again. The groups are -NH2 (at C2), -COCH3 (at C1), and -Br (at C5).\n    *   The powerful activating -NH2 group directs *ortho* (to C3) and *para* (to C6).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs *meta* (to C3).\n    *   The -Br group directs *ortho* (to C4 and C6).\n    The directing effects of the -NH2 and -COCH3 groups reinforce each other, directing the new nitro group to position 3. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protonated or protected, but the overall logic of placing the nitro group at C3 holds).\n\n*   **vi) 1-(2-Amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium Salt.**\n    The amino group at C2 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\n*   **vii) Diazonium Salt --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). This removes the temporary directing group from C2. The final product has the acetyl group at C1, and the substituents originally at C3 and C5 are now at C3 and C5 relative to the acetyl group. The bromine is at C5 and nitro at C3, which is 1-(5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, identical to the target molecule 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D describes a logical, albeit multi-step, synthetic pathway that correctly uses an amino group as a temporary directing group to install the substituents in the desired 1,3,5-pattern and then removes it. The other options contain chemically infeasible steps.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   The parent is **acetophenone**, which is a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3). Let's define the carbon attached to the acetyl group as C1.\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   C1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   C3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   C5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. (This group often appears as an intermediate).\n\nThe main challenge is synthesizing a molecule where an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) is located *meta* to the other groups. This often requires a multi-step strategy involving a temporary \"directing group\" that is later removed.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option methodically.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): **This step fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline. This forms a complex (-NH3+ AlCl3-) which strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n    iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 (Deamination): This reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen, converting the intermediate back to **benzene**. A synthetic sequence that starts with benzene and returns to benzene after four steps is illogical. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n    ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product, since -Br is an *o,p*-director and *para* is sterically favored).\n    iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): **This step fails.** The ring is strongly deactivated by both a bromo group and a nitro group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is more complex and appears to use a directing group strategy. Let's trace it carefully.\n    i) **Benzene → Acetophenone:** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is now on the ring. It is a *meta*-director.\n    ii) **Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing -COCH3 group directs the bromine to the C3 position. This is correct.\n    iii) **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone → Nitration:** Now we nitrate. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The directing effects are conflicting. The *o,p*-directing effect of the halogen usually wins, directing the nitro group to positions *ortho* and *para* to it (C2, C4, C6). The position *para* to the bulky acetyl group (C4) is the most likely major product. So, we form **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. This nitro group is a temporary placeholder.\n    iv) **Reduction → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone:** The nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using Fe/HCl. Now we have a powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group.\n    v) **Nitration → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone:** This is the key step. We nitrate again. The powerful activating amino group at C4 directs *ortho* to itself, to C3 (blocked by Br) and C5. The acetyl group at C1 directs *meta* to itself, also to C5. Both groups work together to direct the new nitro group to the C5 position. (In practice, the amino group would be protected first, but the directing principle is sound).\n    vi) **Diazotization → Diazonium salt:** The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+) with NaNO2/HCl.\n    vii) **Deamination → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The diazonium group at C4 is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2. The temporary directing group is gone, leaving the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5. This is the desired final product.\n\nThis sequence, while long, is chemically sound and cleverly overcomes the conflicting directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. It is the only viable option among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** It is an acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group) with two other substituents.\n    *   Let's assign the carbon attached to the acetyl group as C1.\n    *   Substituent 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1.\n    *   Substituent 2: Bromo group (-Br) at C3.\n    *   Substituent 3: Nitro group (-NO2) at C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* substitution pattern relative to C1.\n\n### 2. Understand Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how existing substituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho, Para-Directors:** -NH2 (amino), -OH, -OR (alkoxy)\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-Directors:** -Br, -Cl, -I (halogens)\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directors:** -COCH3 (acetyl), -NO2 (nitro), -CN, -SO3H\n\nThe challenge here is that we need to place a bromine atom (-Br), which is an *o,p*-director, in a *meta* position relative to the other two groups. This suggests that a simple, direct sequence of substitutions won't work and a more clever strategy is required, likely involving changing the directing nature of a group or using a temporary \"placeholder\" group that is later removed.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Option A)**\n*   `i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene`\n*   `ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline` (-NH2 is a strong *o,p*-director)\n*   `iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation)`: **This step fails.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amino group of aniline. This forms a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-) which strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B)**\n*   `i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene`\n*   `ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline`\n*   `iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt`\n*   `iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 (Deamination)`: This reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with hydrogen, taking the molecule back to **benzene**. A synthetic pathway that starts with benzene and returns to it after four steps is inefficient and incorrect.\n\n**Option C)**\n*   `i) Benzene → Bromobenzene` (-Br is an *o,p*-director)\n*   `ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene` (The major product, since nitration occurs *para* to the bromine).\n*   `iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation)`: **This step fails.** The benzene ring is substituted with two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it too unreactive for a Friedel-Crafts reaction to occur.\n\n**Option D)**\nThis sequence is more complex and uses a well-known strategy involving a temporary directing group.\n\n*   **i) `Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone`**: This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n*   **ii) `Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone`**: Bromination occurs at the *meta* position relative to the acetyl group. This step is correct.\n*   **iii) `1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Mixture`**: This nitration step adds a temporary nitro group. Let's trace the most probable isomer that leads to the final product. The -Br at C3 is an *o,p*-director and the -COCH3 at C1 is a *meta*-director. Nitration is likely to occur *ortho* to the bromine at C2 or C4. Let's follow the path where it adds at C2: `1-(5-bromo-2-nitrophenyl)ethanone`.\n*   **iv) `Product from (iii) --(Fe/HCl)--> 1-(2-amino-5-bromophenyl)ethanone`**: The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **v) `Product from (iv) --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone`**: This is the crucial step. The new nitro group must be placed. The powerful activating amino group at C2 directs *ortho* to position C3. The acetyl group at C1 directs *meta* to C3. Both directing effects reinforce each other, placing the new nitro group precisely at C3.\n*   **vi) `Product from (v) --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium Salt`**: The amino group at C2 is converted into a diazonium group (-N2+).\n*   **vii) `Product from (vi) --(H3PO2)--> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`**: This reaction (deamination) removes the diazonium salt from C2 and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. The temporary directing group is now gone.\n\nThe final molecule has the acetyl group at C1, the new nitro group at C3, and the original bromine atom at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. This sequence is chemically sound and overcomes the challenging directing effects.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's identify the functional groups and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3). Let's assign the carbon attached to this group as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at C1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at C3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe outcome of electrophilic aromatic substitution is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho, para-director**. (This group often serves as an intermediate).\n\nThe main synthetic challenge is placing the bromo group (-Br), an *o,p*-director, in a *meta* position relative to the other groups. This often requires a more complex strategy, such as using a temporary directing group that is later removed.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nLet's systematically analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (-NH2)\n*   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): **This step fails.** The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a strongly deactivated complex (-NH3⁺) that prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 (Deamination): This reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen, converting the molecule back to **benzene**.

Let's trace it:\n1.  **i) `Benzene → Acetophenone`**: Friedel-Crafts acylation installs the -COCH3 group. This group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) `Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone`**: Bromination occurs *meta* to the acetyl group, placing the Br at C3. This is correct.\n3.  **iii) `1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone`**: A temporary nitro group is added.

Nitration will occur preferentially at a position activated by the bromine, C4.\n4.  **iv) `Product from (iii) → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone`**: The temporary nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using Fe/HCl. The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director.\n5.  **v) `Product from (iv) → 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone`**: This is the key step.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is an acetophenone, which is a benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3). Let's define the carbon atom attached to the acetyl group as C1.\n*   **Substituents and their Positions:**\n    *   C1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   C3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   C5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Feature:** All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will attach.\n*   **Meta-Directors (Deactivating):** -COCH3 (acetyl), -NO2 (nitro)\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (Deactivating):** -Br (bromo), -Cl, -I\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (Activating):** -NH2 (amino), -OH\n\nThe primary synthetic challenge is to place the bromo group (-Br), an *ortho, para*-director, into a position that is *meta* to the other two groups. A simple, one-after-the-other addition will not work. This implies that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving the use of a temporary \"directing group\" that is later removed.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nLet's break down each option step-by-step:\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline. The -NH2 group is a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline: **This reaction fails.** The basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a highly deactivated complex (-NH3⁺), which prevents the acylation reaction. Thus, this path is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n*   iv) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 (Deamination): This reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom, regenerating the **benzene** starting material. This is not a productive synthetic route. Thus, this path is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br is an *o,p*-director.\n*   ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene: **This reaction fails.** The ring is substituted with two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it too unreactive to undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation. Thus, this path is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\nThis sequence uses a multi-step strategy involving a temporary directing group.\n1.  **i) `Benzene --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> Acetophenone`**: This installs the acetyl group (-COCH3), which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) `Acetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone`**: Bromination occurs at the *meta* position (C3) as directed by the acetyl group. The substitution pattern is now 1,3.\n3.  **iii) `Nitration`**: A temporary nitro group is added. The directing effects of the -COCH3 (*meta*) and -Br (*ortho, para*) would lead to a mixture, but a major product will be **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethanone**. Let's follow this intermediate.\n4.  **iv) `Reduction`**: The temporary nitro group at C4 is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using Fe/HCl, forming **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethanone**. The -NH2 group is a very strong *ortho, para*-director.\n5.  **v) `Nitration`**: This is the crucial step. The final nitro group is added.\n    *   The powerful -NH2 group at C4 strongly directs incoming electrophiles to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5). C3 is blocked by bromine. Therefore, it directs strongly to C5.\n    *   The -COCH3 group at C1 directs *meta* to C5.\n    *   The directing effects are **cooperative**, ensuring the new nitro group adds specifically to **C5**.\n6.  **vi) `Diazotization`**: The temporary amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2⁺) with NaNO2/HCl.\n7.  **vii) `Deamination`**: The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom using H3PO2.\n\nThis final step removes the temporary directing group from C4, leaving the acetyl group at C1, bromine at C3, and the final nitro group at C5, successfully forming the target molecule. This sequence is chemically sound and achieves the difficult 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
