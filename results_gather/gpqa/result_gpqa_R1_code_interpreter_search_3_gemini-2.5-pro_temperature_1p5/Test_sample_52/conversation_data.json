    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two other groups (substituents). The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 fragment.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group. An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. It contributes two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, consistent with this finding.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This is the most informative piece of data for determining the structure.\n        *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a high degree of symmetry. A 1,4-disubstitution (para) pattern typically gives two signals (often two doublets), which fits this description perfectly.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n            *   Let's analyze this pattern: in a fragment like Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   Proton H(b) is split by proton H(a) into a doublet, and it is also split by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group into a quartet. The result is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent proton H(b). The result is a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group as one of the substituents. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n        *   **Two -CH3 signals:** The molecule contains two methyl (-CH3) groups that are in different chemical environments.\n            *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) identified above.\n            *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   From the aromatic signals, we have a **C6H4** ring core.\n    *   From the vinyl signals, we have a **-CH=CH-CH3** (propenyl) substituent (formula **C3H5**).\n    *   The second substituent must contain the ester group (**-COO-**) and the second methyl group (**-CH3**). It must not contain a -CH2- group. The only simple ways to combine -COO- and -CH3 without a -CH2- are to form a methyl ester group (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group linked through oxygen (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester + methyl): C2H3O2\n\n    *   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester part)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches one of the choices provided.\n\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct option is B. To confirm, if the formula were C12H14O2, the second substituent would have to be made of C3H5O2 (C12H14O2 - C6H4 - C3H5). To make an ester with a methyl group from this would require fragments like -COOCH2CH3, which contains a -CH2- group, violating the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem that can be solved by systematically breaking down the information provided by the spectroscopic data to deduce the molecular fragments and then assembling them to find the total molecular formula.\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the base of our molecule is a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The fragment of the ring itself is therefore C6H4.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester functional group is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms. All the provided options have two oxygen atoms (O2), which is consistent with this information.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\nThis is the most crucial data for identifying the fragments of the molecule.\n*   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern. The most common pattern that gives two signals is 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms our C6H4 fragment.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   In a fragment `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`:\n    *   The proton H(b) is split by its neighbor H(a) into a doublet, and it is also split by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group into a quartet. This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The proton H(a) is only split by its neighbor H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group. This fragment's formula is **C3H5**.\n*   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means the molecule contains two methyl groups that are in different chemical environments.\n    *   One methyl group is the one we just identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups. This means the second substituent, which contains an ester and a methyl group, cannot have a structure like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), as that contains a -CH2- group. The only simple way to combine the ester and the second methyl group without a -CH2- is to form a **methyl ester group (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate group (-OCOCH3)**. In either case, the formula of this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\nNow, let's sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n*   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n*   Substituent 1 (propenyl group): **C3H5**\n*   Substituent 2 (ester + methyl group): **C2H3O2**\n\nLet's calculate the total formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options:**\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option B.\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C11H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by other groups. The core fragment of the ring itself is therefore **C6H4**.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** \"absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contributes **two oxygen atoms** (O2) to the molecule. All four options provided have O2 in their formula, so this is a consistent check.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This is the most detailed piece of information for identifying the attached groups (substituents).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** The C6H4 ring fragment has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons indicates a symmetrical arrangement. A 1,4-disubstitution (para) is the most common pattern that produces two distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the fragment `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents is a propenyl group. Let's count its atoms: **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One `-CH3` group is part of the propenyl substituent we just identified (`-CH=CH-**CH3**`).\n        *   The second `-CH3` group must be part of the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The second substituent must contain the ester group and a methyl group, but it cannot contain any methylene (`-CH2-`) units.
