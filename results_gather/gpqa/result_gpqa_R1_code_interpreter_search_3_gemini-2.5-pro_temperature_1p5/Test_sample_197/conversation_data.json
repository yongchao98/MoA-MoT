    "This problem requires us to calculate the mole fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing multiple cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The mole fraction (or distribution coefficient), denoted as αn, for a complex `MLn` is given by the ratio of the concentration of that specific complex to the total concentration of the metal ion in all its forms.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibria and Stability Constants**\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria, with their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+`\n    `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]`\n    `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n    `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Express Concentrations in Terms of the Free Metal Ion**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free `Co^2+` concentration and the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n**3. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nFactoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α2)**\n\nThe mole fraction of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, which we'll call `α2`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation.\n\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**5.

    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem regarding complex ion equilibrium.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal:**\nThe core of the question is to determine the relative proportion of one specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, compared to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution. This proportion is known as the mole fraction or distribution coefficient, denoted as α₂ for the complex with two ligands. We need to express this fraction as a percentage.\n\n**2. Writing Down the Equilibria:**\nThe formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes from the free `Co^2+` ion and thiocyanate `SCN^-` ligand is described by a series of stepwise equilibria. The overall stability constants (β) represent the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the corresponding number of ligands:\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]` (the blue complex)\n    *   `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]²) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]³) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n    *   `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]⁴) = 16`\n\n**3. Defining the Total Cobalt Concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free, uncomplexed `Co^2+` ion and all of the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**4. Formulating the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\nThe mole fraction of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nTo solve this, we can express the concentration of each species in terms of the free `Co^2+` concentration, the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`, and the stability constants (β):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β₁[Co^2+][SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂[Co^2+][SCN^-]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β₃[Co^2+][SCN^-]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β₄[Co^2+][SCN^-]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equations for `c(Co)` and `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co^2+][SCN^-]²) / ([Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN^-]¹ + β₂[Co^2+][SCN^-]² + β₃[Co^2+][SCN^-]³ + β₄[Co^2+][SCN^-]⁴)`\n\nThe concentration of the free metal ion `[Co^2+]` is a common factor in every term in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN^-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN^-]¹ + β₂[SCN^-]² + β₃[SCN^-]³ + β₄[SCN^-]⁴)`\n\nThis simplified formula shows that the mole fraction of any given complex depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants, not on the total metal concentration. We are given that `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`. The problem also states that `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`, which is significantly less than the thiocyanate concentration. This supports the assumption that the free `[SCN^-]` concentration is approximately equal to the total given concentration of 0.1 M.\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nNow we plug the given values into the formula.\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN^-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis calculation can be done precisely using Python.\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nligand_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha2 fraction\n# This corresponds to the relative concentration of [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (ligand_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the alpha2 fraction\n# This is the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt species\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * (ligand_conc ** 1) + beta2 * (ligand_conc ** 2) + beta3 * (ligand_conc ** 3) + beta4 * (ligand_conc ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage and print the result rounded to one decimal place\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n\nThe calculated percentage is 16.9%, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction (distribution coefficient), denoted as `α₂`, relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` ion and all the formed complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction α₂:**\nThe mole fraction of the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 1 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow we can write the full expression for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Assumption on ligand concentration:**\nThe total cobalt concentration (`10⁻² M`) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`). This implies that the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as its total concentration, `0.1 M`.\n\n**4.
