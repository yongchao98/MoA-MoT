    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key aspects to consider are chemical equivalence (determined by molecular symmetry) and splitting patterns (J-coupling). Since all observed signals are singlets, we are looking for compounds where protons do not have any non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nAll four compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons (into a quartet), and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons (into a triplet).\n    *   Since the problem states all signals are singlets, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has two aromatic protons at positions C5 and C6. These two protons are adjacent to each other.\n    *   They will couple with each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AB quartet system), not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\nThis leaves us with only two possible compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This already points towards option D, but we must verify that their mixture matches the data.\n\n### **3. Predict the Spectra of the Remaining Compounds**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups fall into three distinct chemical environments:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection across the symmetry plane. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This gives a third **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **4. Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Because the chemical environments are different, these two singlets will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, their integrations will be equal.\n    *   **Result:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **This matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states we observe **three** signals in a **2:1:1** ratio. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the integrals. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + (6+3+3) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the signals correspond to:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's see if we can form this pattern from our components:\n        *   The **12H** signal comes from the single methyl peak of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The first **6H** signal comes from the equivalent C1/C3 methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The second **6H** signal must come from an accidental overlap of the other two signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (the 3H signal from C2-Me and the 3H signal from C5-Me). This is a common phenomenon in NMR.\n    *   **Result:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. **This matches the experimental data.**\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the structures of two compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their combined ¹H NMR spectrum. We will analyze the predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four potential compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information. This means that in the aromatic region, the protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons. In the aliphatic region, the methyl groups are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound to see if they could produce only singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C₆H₄(CH₂CH₃)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄. The formula is correct.\n    *   Spectrum Prediction: This molecule has ethyl groups. The protons of the -CH₂- group will be split by the protons of the adjacent -CH₃ group, resulting in a **quartet**. The protons of the -CH₃ group will be split by the -CH₂- protons, resulting in a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would not produce only singlets. It can be **eliminated**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. The formula is correct.\n    *   Spectrum Prediction: This molecule has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6. These protons are adjacent to each other and will split each other's signals. This will produce a pair of **doublets** (an AB quartet system).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would not produce only singlets in the aromatic region. It can be **eliminated**.\n\nThis elimination process leaves only two possible compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This strongly suggests that option D is the correct answer. Let's confirm by analyzing their spectra and the spectrum of their mixture.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no neighboring protons, so they will produce a single **singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** for **12H**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two singlets total (one aromatic 2H, one aliphatic 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent by symmetry. They have no neighboring protons, so they will produce a single **singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The methyl groups exist in three distinct chemical environments:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent: **one singlet (6H)**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Four singlets total (one aromatic 2H, and three aliphatic singlets with a 6:3:3 or 2:1:1 integration ratio).\n\n### **3. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's consider a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Since these are different molecules, the two singlets will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. As it is a 1:1 mixture, their integrals will be equal.\n    *   **Result:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H).\n    *   The experimental data shows three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This can be explained by an accidental overlap of signals. Let's sum the integrations from the 1:1 mixture:\n        *   Signal 1: The singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB integrates to 12H.\n        *   Signal 2: The most downfield or upfield singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB integrates to 6H.\n        *   Signal 3: The other two singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB (both 3H) happen to have the same chemical shift, so they overlap to form one signal integrating to 3H + 3H = 6H.\n    *   This gives three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all the features of the given ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires a systematic analysis of the ¹H NMR spectra for each possible compound and then determining which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both compounds. All given options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals observed, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlet\" means the aromatic protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that in the 1:1 molar mixture, the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals observed, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Singlet\" means the methyl groups are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons (which is expected for methyl groups on a benzene ring).\n    *   \"Three signals\" with a \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons in the three distinct aliphatic environments.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will evaluate each compound based on molecular symmetry to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would show complex splitting. The -CH₂- protons would be a quartet and the -CH₃ protons would be a triplet. This contradicts the data that all signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** This molecule has two aromatic protons at the C5 and C6 positions. These two protons are adjacent to each other and would couple, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet system). This contradicts the data that the aromatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H singlet, one 12H singlet).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different environments:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent: **one singlet (6H)**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 4 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, and three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which is 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the only possible components are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if their 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Since these are from two different compounds, they will appear at different chemical shifts. Because the mixture is 1:1, the two 2H signals will have an integration ratio of 1:1. **This perfectly matches the data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet of intensity **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets of intensities **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   The problem states that there are three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This can be achieved if some signals overlap.\n    *   The signals available are with intensities 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   To get three final signals, two must overlap. The two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can plausibly overlap (accidental degeneracy) to give one signal of intensity 6H.\n    *   This would result in three signals with intensities of **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also perfectly matches the data.**\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to identify two aromatic compounds from a list of four options, based on the ¹H NMR spectrum of their 1:1 mixture.

This severely constrains the possible structures, as it implies that no protons are coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it would produce only singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons of the -CH₂- group are adjacent to the three protons of the -CH₃ group and will be split into a quartet.

Analyze the Predicted Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nLet's combine the predicted spectra for a 1:1 molar mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   Since these singlets come from different molecules, they will have slightly different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1.\n    *   This result (two singlets in a 1:1 ratio) **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed with a 2:1:1 ratio. This implies an accidental overlap of two signals.\n    *   Let's check the integrations. The signals available are with relative proton counts of 12, 6, 3, and 3.\n    *   To get three signals, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must overlap to form a single peak with an integration of 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals would have integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This result **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that can account for all the features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
