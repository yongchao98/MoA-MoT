    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The key is to determine the final composition of the solution after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n    *   Moles of acid/base = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of HCl (strong acid) = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol.

It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid vs. Remaining Strong Base**\n        *   CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        *   Initial moles: 0.050 mol CH3COOH and 0.100 mol OH⁻ (from the previous step).\n        *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant.
