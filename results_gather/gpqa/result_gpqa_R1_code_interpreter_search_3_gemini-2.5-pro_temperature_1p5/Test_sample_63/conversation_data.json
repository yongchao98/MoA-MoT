    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This means the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen-containing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increase is 0.80 g. This mass increase is solely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   These oxygen atoms could have come from O₂ gas (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or another oxidizing gas like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms were delivered to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** The final volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas passed unreacted through a drying agent, a base, and hot copper. This indicates it's a relatively inert gas. Given that the salts must contain nitrogen (to form nitrogen-oxygen compounds), the most likely candidate for gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as the final gas N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and in the CuO formed.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Other elements:** Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no carbon. The total mass can be checked to see if any other elements are present.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly. Therefore, salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n*   The total moles of each element are: N = 0.20 mol, H = 0.40 mol, O = 0.25 mol.\n*   The ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit (A + B) is proportional to the mole ratio: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: (0.20×20) : (0.40×20) : (0.25×20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one unit of A and one unit of B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   We need to partition this formula into two plausible salts. Common salts containing only N, H, and O that decompose on heating are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's check their formulas:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): N₂H₄O₂\n        *   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Let's add these two formulas together:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N(₂+₂)H(₄+₄)O(₂+₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n*   This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for \"the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of products\nmass_H2O = 3.60\nmolar_mass_H2O = 18.0\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / molar_mass_H2O\n\nmass_O_increase = 0.80\nmolar_mass_O = 16.0\nmoles_O_atoms_in_CuO = mass_O_increase / molar_mass_O\n\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24\nmolar_volume_STP = 22.4\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / molar_volume_STP # This is N2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of elements\nmoles_H = 2 * moles_H2O\nmoles_N = 2 * moles_gas_C\nmoles_O = 1 * moles_H2O + moles_O_atoms_in_CuO\n\n# Step 3: Check mass and determine formula\ntotal_mass = moles_H * 1.0 + moles_N * 14.0 + moles_O * 16.0\n# The ratio of moles N:H:O is 0.2:0.4:0.25, which simplifies to 4:8:5\n# This implies a combined formula of N4H8O5 for (A+B)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total atoms from the identified salts NH4NO2 and NH4NO3\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 (N2H4O2) = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 (N2H4O3) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9\ntotal_atoms = 8 + 9\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant used to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced during the decomposition.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ (or any other gas that reacts with Ca(OH)₂) was produced. This implies that the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, particularly those containing oxygen, such as O₂ or nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O, NO). The problem states that CuO is formed and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This means one of the gaseous products from the initial decomposition contained 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that were reactive towards hot copper.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas (C) did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, indicating it's a relatively inert gas. Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of salts that decompose into gases), the most probable identity for gas C is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nThe atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water (H₂O) and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu)\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** A common decomposition reaction of ammonium salts involves the formation of nitrogen oxides or N₂ gas. Let's consider the reaction with copper: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO and also produces 1 mole of N₂ gas.\n    *   The 0.05 moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu could have come from 0.05 moles of N₂O gas. This reaction would have produced 0.05 moles of N₂.\n    *   The total amount of N₂ collected at the end was 0.10 mol. If 0.05 mol of this N₂ came from the N₂O reaction, the other 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly in the initial decomposition.\n    *   This implies the decomposition produced a mixture of gases: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms in the gaseous products = (2 × moles of N₂) + (2 × moles of N₂O) = (2 × 0.05 mol) + (2 × 0.05 mol) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Mass Conservation Check:** Let's see if the masses of the determined elements add up to the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass exactly. Therefore, the salts A and B consist only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two salts containing N, H, and O that, when heated, produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The most common salts with this profile are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches our findings. The mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contained `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From our analysis, 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O were produced. This means `x` must be 0.05 mol.\n*   So, we started with 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n*   Let's check the amount of water produced:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nThus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.0  # g/mol\nM_O = 16.0  # g/mol\nMOLAR_VOL_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O_absorbed = 3.60  # g\nmass_O_increase_on_Cu = 0.80  # g\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O_absorbed / M_H2O\nmoles_O_from_gas = mass_O_increase_on_Cu / M_O\nmoles_N2_final = volume_gas_C / MOLAR_VOL_STP\n\n# Based on the reaction Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2,\n# moles of N2O is equal to moles of O atoms reacted with Cu.\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_from_gas\n\n# The final N2 is a sum of N2 produced directly and N2 from the N2O reaction.\nmoles_N2_direct = moles_N2_final - moles_N2O\n\n# This implies the decomposition produced moles_N2_direct of N2 and moles_N2O of N2O.\n# From the decomposition reactions:\n# NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# NH4NO3 -> N2O + 2H2O\n# The moles of the salts must be equal to the moles of the nitrogen gases produced.\n# So, moles of NH4NO2 = moles_N2_direct and moles of NH4NO3 = moles_N2O.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total atoms in one formula unit of each salt\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 (N2H4O2) = 2 + 4 + 2\natoms_in_NH4NO2 = 8\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 (N2H4O3) = 2 + 4 + 3\natoms_in_NH4NO3 = 9\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_NH4NO2 + atoms_in_NH4NO3\n\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes. We will analyze the result from each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so its purpose is to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the mass of this tube did not change, no CO₂ (or any other gas that reacts with Ca(OH)₂) was produced. This is a crucial clue that the original salts do not contain any carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is entirely due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper must be an oxygen-containing gas. Common examples from salt decomposition are N₂O or NO. A likely reaction is: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms to form CuO and would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This chemical inertness strongly suggests that gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   This 0.10 mol of N₂ at the end consists of any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition plus any N₂ produced in Tube №3. From our analysis of Tube №3, the reaction of N₂O with Cu would produce 0.05 mol of N₂. This means the initial decomposition must have produced the other 0.05 mol of N₂ directly.\n    *   Therefore, the gaseous mixture from the decomposition was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n**2. Deduce the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nThe atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Found only in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Found in H₂O and N₂O.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in N₂O) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (1 × 0.05 mol) = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Found in N₂ and N₂O.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = (moles of N in N₂) + (moles of N in N₂O) = (2 × 0.05 mol) + (2 × 0.05 mol) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Mass Conservation Check:**\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture perfectly. The composition is confirmed to be only N, H, and O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, containing salts A and B which are composed of N, H, and O. The decomposition reactions that produce N₂ and N₂O are characteristic of specific ammonium salts:\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: **NH₄NO₂**(s) → **N₂**(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate: **NH₄NO₃**(s) → **N₂O**(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nOur analysis showed that 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O were produced. This strongly implies that the original mixture was an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with all the data.\n*   So, Salt A = NH₄NO₂ and Salt B = NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Total atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Total atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option C. I will now use a Python script to verify the numerical calculations.\n```python\n# Problem: An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated.\n# Gases passed through Mg(ClO4)2 (absorbs H2O), Ca(OH)2 (no change), and hot Cu.\n# Mass increase of Tube 1 (H2O) = 3.60 g\n# Mass increase of Tube 3 (O in CuO) = 0.80 g\n# Remaining gas (N2) = 2.24 L at STP\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of products from experimental data\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / 18.0  # Molar mass of H2O is 18.0 g/mol\nmoles_O_in_CuO = 0.80 / 16.0  # Molar mass of O is 16.0 g/mol\nmoles_N2_final = 2.24 / 22.4  # Molar volume at STP is 22.4 L/mol\n\n# The gas that reacted with Cu must be an oxidizing agent like N2O.\n# Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2\n# From this, moles_N2O = moles_O_in_CuO\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_in_CuO\n# This reaction also produces N2. moles_N2_from_N2O = moles_N2O\nmoles_N2_from_N2O = moles_N2O\n\n# The final N2 is a sum of N2 from the N2O reaction and N2 produced directly.\n# moles_N2_final = moles_N2_direct + moles_N2_from_N2O\nmoles_N2_direct = moles_N2_final - moles_N2_from_N2O\n\n# Step 2: Identify salts based on the decomposition products\n# The production of N2 directly suggests NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# The production of N2O suggests NH4NO3 -> N2O + 2H2O\n# Since the initial mixture was equimolar and we got moles_N2_direct of N2 and moles_N2O of N2O,\n# this confirms A is NH4NO2 and B is NH4NO3.\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of atoms in the formula units of the two salts\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 2  # N, H, O\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 3  # N, H, O\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>",

Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe experiment is designed to separate and identify the gaseous products from the decomposition of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a potent drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂).

This mass increase is solely due to the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar Mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   A common gaseous product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction with hot copper would be: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen to form CuO. Therefore, the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms must have come from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produces an equivalent amount of nitrogen gas (0.05 mol of N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all the tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas (C) remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C passed through all reagents unreacted, which identifies it as a relatively inert gas. Given the context, it is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   This 0.10 mol of N₂ collected at the end is the sum of any N₂ produced directly from the initial heating and the N₂ produced in Tube №3 from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂(direct) + N₂(from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂(direct) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition directly produced **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nWe have determined that the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture produced three gases: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\nWe need to find two salts (A and B) that are composed of N, H, and O (since no C was detected) and decompose upon heating to yield these specific products. The decomposition reactions for ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate are well-known and fit this pattern perfectly:\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture of A and B was equimolar. Let's assume we started with `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   From the reaction, `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ would produce `x` moles of N₂.\n*   From the reaction, `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ would produce `x` moles of N₂O.\n\nOur analysis showed that 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O were produced. This means `x = 0.05` mol. The initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent with the amount of water produced:\n*   Water from NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol × 2 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   Water from NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol × 2 = 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   Total water produced = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\nThis matches our calculation from step 1. Thus, Salts A and B are confirmed to be Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each distinct salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C. I will use the code interpreter to perform the calculations as a final check.\n```python\n# The reasoning has identified the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n# The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n# This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n# Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2, which is N2H4O2)\n# Number of N atoms = 2\n# Number of H atoms = 4\n# Number of O atoms = 2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3, which is N2H4O3)\n# Number of N atoms = 2\n# Number of H atoms = 4\n# Number of O atoms = 3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes a sequence of reactions to identify the gaseous products from the decomposition. Let's analyze each step:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This is a key finding: the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is entirely due to the oxygen atoms that have bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This indicates that one of the gaseous products contained 0.05 moles of reactive oxygen atoms. A common decomposition product of nitrogen-based salts is dinitrogen monoxide (N₂O). The reaction with hot copper would be: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, 0.05 moles of N₂O would provide the 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms to form CuO, and it would also produce 0.05 moles of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remained, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas (C) is chemically inert to the reagents used, which strongly identifies it as nitrogen gas (N₂). This final 0.10 mol of N₂ consists of any N₂ produced directly in the decomposition plus the N₂ produced in Tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ collected = N₂(from initial decomposition) + N₂(from N₂O reaction in Tube 3)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂(initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition must have directly produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nFrom our analysis, the initial decomposition produced a gas mixture of:\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n\nWe are looking for two nitrogen-hydrogen-oxygen salts (A and B) that would yield these products. The decomposition reactions of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate are a perfect match:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. If we assume the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃, the products would be:\n*   From NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From NH₄NO₃: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   Total products: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\nThis perfectly matches our findings from the experimental data. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This implies the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning identified the salts as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n# The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrite is NH4NO2.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O2.\natoms_in_salt_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # (2 N, 4 H, 2 O)\n\n# Formula for Ammonium Nitrate is NH4NO3.\n# We can represent its elemental count as N2H4O3.\natoms_in_salt_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # (2 N, 4 H, 3 O)\n\n# The total number of atoms is the sum of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B.\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_salt_A + atoms_in_salt_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<C>>>"
