    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Potential:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass `m` in a 3D potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three spatial directions (x, y, z).\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. It can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The total energy `E` is the sum of the energies of these three oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    Therefore, the total energy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number `n`.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state. It corresponds to $n=0$ ($n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This is the state we are interested in.

There are 3 permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n    *   One number is 2, one is 1, the other is 0: e.g., (2, 1, 0). There are $3! = 6$ permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n    *   All numbers are 1: e.g., (1, 1, 1). There is only 1 permutation.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    A more general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect.\n    *   C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n    *   D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law.
