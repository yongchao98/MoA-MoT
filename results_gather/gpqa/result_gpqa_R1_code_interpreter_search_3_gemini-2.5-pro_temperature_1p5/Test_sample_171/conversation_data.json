    "Here's a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The question relates the population of atomic energy levels to temperature. In astrophysics, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this relationship is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state *i* (N_i) to the number of atoms in a lower state *j* (N_j) is given by:\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[- (E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   g_i and g_j are the statistical weights of the respective energy levels.\n    *   E_i - E_j is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call ΔE.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** We are considering the *same* two energy levels for iron in both stars, so the values for g_i, g_j, and ΔE are the same for both. The temperatures, however, are different (T_1 for star_1 and T_2 for star_2).\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1):\n        (N_i / N_j)_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2):\n        (N_i / N_j)_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Translate the problem's condition into a mathematical expression:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of excited to lower state atoms in star_1 is twice the same ratio in star_2.\n    (N_i / N_j)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_j)_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into this condition:**\n    (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the combined equation:**\n    *   The statistical weight term (g_i / g_j) appears on both sides, so it cancels out.\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperature terms:** To deal with the exponents, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n    ln( exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ) = ln( 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n\n8.  **Apply logarithm rules:**\n    *   ln(e^x) = x\n    *   ln(a * b) = ln(a) + ln(b)\n\n    Applying these rules gives:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln( exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n9.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):**\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n10. **Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):**\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)\n\n11. **Combine the fractions inside the brackets:** Find a common denominator (T_1 * T_2).\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n12. **Analyze the given numerical values:**\n    *   Energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1. The problem is set up so this simplifies nicely.\n\n13. **Substitute (ΔE / k) ≈ 1 into the equation:**\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n14. **Compare this result with the given options:**\n    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.**\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\n\nThe derived equation perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
