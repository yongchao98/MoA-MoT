    "The user wants to find the total energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c.\n\n**1. Identify the nucleus and its properties:**\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus X as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Find the rest mass of the nucleus:**\nTo calculate the energy, we first need the rest mass ($m_0$) of the $^{6}$Li nucleus. It's common to use the mass of the atom and convert it to energy units.\n*   From reference data, the atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom is approximately 6.015122795 u (atomic mass units).\n*   The mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of its 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u.\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u.\n*   Mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus = 6.015122795 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013477055 u.\n*   The conversion factor from atomic mass units to Mega-electron Volts (MeV) is approximately 1 u = 931.494102 MeV/c².\n\n**3. Calculate the rest energy ($E_0$):**\nThe rest energy is given by $E_0 = m_0 c^2$.\n*   $E_0 = 6.013477055 \\text{ u} \\times 931.494102 \\frac{\\text{MeV/c}^2}{\\text{u}} \\times c^2$\n*   $E_0 \\approx 5601.52 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Converting to Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n    $E_0 \\approx 5.60152 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle depends on the Lorentz factor, which is determined by its speed.\n*   The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**5. Calculate the total energy (E):**\nThe total relativistic energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n*   $E = \\gamma E_0$\n*   $E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5.60152 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E \\approx 20.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.005 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy (about 0.6%) likely arises from using a slightly different value for the mass of $^{6}$Li or physical constants. Let's re-evaluate using the mass from option B to see if it matches. If the total energy is 20.132 GeV, the rest energy would be $E_0 = E / \\gamma = 20.132 / 3.5714 \\approx 5.637$ GeV, which corresponds to a mass slightly different from the standard reference value but still reasonable. Given the choices, B is the most plausible answer.\n\nLet's execute the calculation with a higher precision to confirm.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27  # Conversion from atomic mass units to kg\nelectron_charge = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\n\n# Mass of Li-6 atom in atomic mass units (u)\n# Using a standard reference value (e.g., from NIST)\nmass_Li6_atom_u = 6.0151228874\n\n# Mass of an electron in u\nmass_electron_u = 0.000548579909\n\n# Calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus\nmass_Li6_nucleus_u = mass_Li6_atom_u - 3 * mass_electron_u\n\n# Calculate rest energy in Joules\nrest_energy_J = mass_Li6_nucleus_u * u_to_kg * c**2\n\n# Convert rest energy to GeV\n# 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J\n# 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\nrest_energy_GeV = rest_energy_J / (electron_charge * 1e9)\n\n# Given speed\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor\nlorentz_gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Calculate total energy\ntotal_energy_GeV = lorentz_gamma * rest_energy_GeV\n\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>20.0054\n\nThe high-precision calculation yields 20.0054 GeV. Among the given options, 20.132 GeV is the closest value. The difference might stem from the specific mass value or constants intended for the problem. However, based on standard physical data, option B is the most physically accurate choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n*   The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   The ratio v/c is 0.96.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428\n\n**4. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)**\n\nTo find the rest energy, we need the rest mass (m₀) of the $^{6}$Li nucleus. The most accurate way is to use its measured atomic mass and subtract the mass of its electrons. We will use standard physical constants for this calculation.\n\n*   **Mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom:** 6.0151228874 u (atomic mass units).\n*   **Mass of an electron:** 0.0005485799 u.\n*   **Mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus (m₀):** Mass of atom - Mass of 3 electrons\n    m₀ = 6.0151228874 u - 3 * 0.0005485799 u = 6.0134771477 u.\n*   **Conversion from u to energy:** 1 u ≈ 931.494102 MeV/c².\n*   **Rest Energy (E₀):** E₀ = 6.0134771477 u * 931.494102 MeV/c² ≈ 5601.52 MeV.\n*   Converting to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV), E₀ ≈ 5.60152 GeV.\n\n**5.

The small difference (about 0.6%) is likely due to the problem statement using slightly different physical constants or a simplified approximation for the nuclear mass (e.g., summing the masses of constituent protons and neutrons without accounting for binding energy).
