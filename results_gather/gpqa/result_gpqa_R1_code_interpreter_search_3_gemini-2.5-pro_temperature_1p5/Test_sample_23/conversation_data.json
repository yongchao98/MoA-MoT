    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The molar mass is approximately `12x + y`.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. The fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z. Let's call the other liquid D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components (Z and D) do not have C=C or C≡C bonds that react with bromine under standard conditions.\n    *   We already established Z is a cycloalkane, which fits this condition.\n    *   D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In the context of hydrocarbons and a platinum catalyst, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms. One molecule gets hydrogenated (reduced), and another gets dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   So, some components of X are hydrogenated to form Z (the cycloalkane), and some are dehydrogenated to form D.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Step**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y = {Z, D} gives only Z.\n        *   `Z + H2 -> Z` (since Z is already saturated).\n        *   `D + H2 -> Z`.\n    *   This implies that D is an unsaturated compound that, upon adding hydrogen, forms Z. It also means D must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   We have a conflict: D is formed by dehydrogenation and must be unsaturated, but it must *not* decolorize bromine water. The only class of unsaturated hydrocarbons that do not readily react with bromine water are aromatic compounds.\n    *   Therefore, D must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as the cycloalkane Z. This is possible if the skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n    *   If D is benzene (C6H6), then its hydrogenation product would be cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This identifies Z as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's verify:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Formula is CnH2n with n=6. H% = 12*1 / (6*12 + 12*1) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches. Cyclohexane is a common solvent. This matches.\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6). It does not decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This matches.\n    *   So, we have identified Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must be C6 hydrocarbons whose carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring. They are likely unsaturated derivatives of cyclohexane (e.g., cyclohexene, cyclohexadienes).\n    *   The reaction that forms Y from X is a disproportionation of the components of X. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of {Cyclohexane, Benzene}, the overall reaction starting from an equimolar mixture of X = {A, B} can be written as:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is hydrogenated, and the other is dehydrogenated.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   From the balanced chemical equation `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`, we can apply the law of conservation of atoms.\n    *   Since A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons, let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n    *   Balancing carbon atoms: C6 + C6 -> C6 + C6. This is balanced.\n    *   Balancing hydrogen atoms: `Ha + Hb = 12 + 6`\n    *   `Ha + Hb = 18`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `Ha + Hb`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n*(Self-check: We can identify plausible structures for A and B. A could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and B could be cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). C6H10 has no conjugated bonds. C6H8 has isolated double bonds, so no conjugation. Both decolorize bromine water. Both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The sum of their hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6 is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The solution is consistent.)*\n\nThe final answer is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze substance Z**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is characteristic. The fraction 14.28% is equivalent to 0.1428, which is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's verify this: Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   If `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, then `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n, which is CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated compound (contains no double or triple bonds).\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also mentioned to be a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's check the mass percent of hydrogen in cyclohexane (C6H12): H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms our assumption.\n    *   So, substance **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One liquid is Z (cyclohexane). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane, being a saturated cycloalkane, does not react with bromine water. Therefore, substance D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) will yield Z itself, as it is already saturated.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must yield Z (cyclohexane). This means D has the same carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring) as cyclohexane but is unsaturated.\n    *   An unsaturated compound that does not decolorize bromine water is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The only aromatic C6 hydrocarbon is benzene.\n    *   So, **D is benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Thus, mixture **Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze mixture X and the reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning that at least one (and likely both) of its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are hydrocarbons with a six-carbon ring skeleton that can be fully saturated to form cyclohexane.\n    *   The reaction that transforms mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. This type of reaction involves both oxidation (dehydrogenation) and reduction (hydrogenation).\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction can be represented as the reaction of one molecule of A with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of Z and one molecule of D:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Z + D\n    *   Substituting the formulas we found:\n        C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6\n        (where A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation.\n    *   The number of carbon atoms is already balanced (6 + 6 on the left, 6 + 6 on the right).\n    *   For the hydrogen atoms to be balanced, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A and B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (Z and D).\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Z) + (H atoms in D)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   This sum represents the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nAs a check, we could have A = cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Sum of hydrogens: 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated).\n*   Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\nThis pair of substances fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(Mass of H) / (Total Molar Mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, we can solve for the relationship between x and y:\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a fully saturated molecule.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Furthermore, Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's test if cyclohexane (C6H12) fits.\n    *   For C6H12, n=6, and the formula is CnH2n. The mass percent of hydrogen is `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and one of them is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid be D. So, Y = {Cyclohexane, D}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since cyclohexane is saturated, it won't react. This means that liquid D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (cyclohexane) will not cause any reaction, as it's already saturated.\n        *   Hydrogenating liquid D must produce Z (cyclohexane). This implies D has the same C6 carbon skeleton as cyclohexane but is unsaturated.\n    *   An unsaturated compound with a C6 ring that does not react with bromine water is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). Benzene hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, the other liquid **D is benzene (C6H6)**, and **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   When heated with a platinum catalyst, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This type of reaction involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms: one reactant is reduced (hydrogenated) and the other is oxidized (dehydrogenated).\n    *   The reaction can be written as:\n        `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`\n        `A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n    *   We also know that the complete hydrogenation of mixture X (both A and B) yields only cyclohexane. This confirms that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons with a cyclic carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the formula of liquid A be C6Ha and liquid B be C6Hb. The reaction is:\n        `C6Ha + C6Hb -> C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total hydrogen atoms in reactants = Total hydrogen atoms in products\n        `Ha + Hb = 12 + 6`\n        `Ha + Hb = 18`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is Ha + Hb.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(Total mass of hydrogen) / (Total molar mass)`. Using integer atomic masses for simplicity, this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   We are given `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. This decimal is the well-known fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   Simplifying the equation gives `6y = 12x`, which reduces to `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of substance Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Z is described as the product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated compound.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common and widely used cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's check if cyclohexane, C6H12, fits the description. The formula is CnH2n with n=6. The mass percentage of hydrogen is `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our deduction.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.

This means D is an unsaturated compound that has the same carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring) as cyclohexane.\n    *   A substance that is unsaturated, has a six-carbon ring, and does not react with bromine water under normal conditions is characteristic of an aromatic compound. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). The hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **liquid D is benzene (C6H6)**, and **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which we will call A and B.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means at least one of its components (A or B) contains C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   When mixture X is heated with platinum, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.
