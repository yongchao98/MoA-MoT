    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, `N`, that remain after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is described by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n2.  **Special Relativity & Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so we must consider the effects of special relativity. Specifically, time dilation causes the lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) to be longer than their lifetime in their own rest frame (`τ_proper`).\n3.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The time dilation effect is quantified by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`. A higher Lorentz factor means the particle is moving faster and its lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Mathematical Relationship\n\nThe fraction of particles `(f = N/N₀)` that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay formula. The time of this journey in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is the distance (radius `R`) divided by the particle's velocity (`v`).\n\n*   `t_lab = R / v`\n\nSince the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So we can make the excellent approximation `v ≈ c`.\n\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\nNow, we substitute this time and the dilated lifetime into the decay equation:\n*   `f = N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n*   `f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nLet's group the constant terms. The radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ_proper` are all constants for this experiment. Let `C = R / (c * τ_proper)`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n*   `f = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n### 3. Use the Initial Conditions to Find the Constant\n\nWe are given the initial situation:\n*   When `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n\nLet's plug these values into our equation:\n*   `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant term `C`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n*   `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n*   `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n*   `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for `f₂ = 2/3` of the particles to reach the wall. We use the same formula with the value of `C` we just found:\n\n*   `f₂ = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n*   `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for `γ₂`:\n*   `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n*   `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate `γ₂`:\n*   `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n*   `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial conditions\ngamma1 = 20.0\n# The new desired fraction of surviving particles\nf2 = 2.0 / 3.0\n\n# The relationship derived from the physics is:\n# gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)\n# This simplifies to:\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n```output\n54.18430722122699\n```\n\nThe calculated value is approximately `54.18`. Looking at the multiple-choice options, this is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",

To an observer in the lab, the particle's internal clock runs slower. This phenomenon, called time dilation, means the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper`).\n3.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The time dilation effect is quantified by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`. A higher Lorentz factor means the particle is moving faster (closer to the speed of light) and its lifetime appears significantly longer to an observer in the lab.\n\n### 2.

The radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` are all constants for this specific experiment. Let `C = R / (c * τ_proper)`. This constant `C` encapsulates the fixed parameters of the setup. The equation simplifies to:\n\n*   `f = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n### 3. Use the Initial Conditions to Find the Constant Term\n\nWe are given the initial situation:\n*   When the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n\nLet's plug these values into our simplified equation:\n*   `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant term `C`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n*   `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n*   `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n*   `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for a fraction `f₂ = 2/3` of the particles to reach the wall. We use the same formula, `f = exp(-C / γ)`, but this time we solve for `γ₂` using the value of `C` we just found.\n\n*   `f₂ = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n*   `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to begin isolating `γ₂`:\n*   `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n*   `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n*   `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n*   `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (-(ln(2) - ln(3)))`\n*   `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value for `γ₂` using the derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the relationship: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n# This can also be written as: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma_1 = 20.0\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18430722122699\n```\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18.

    "The problem describes a classic scenario involving special relativity and particle decay. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### **1. The Physics of the Problem**\n\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction, *f*, of particles that survive after a time *t* is given by the formula:\n    *f* = *N*/*N₀* = exp(-*t* / *τ*)\n    where *τ* is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where time *t* is measured.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. According to special relativity, their lifetime as measured in the lab's reference frame (*τ<sub>lab</sub>*) is longer than their intrinsic lifetime in their own rest frame (*τ<sub>proper</sub>*). This effect is called time dilation and is quantified by the Lorentz factor, *γ*:\n    *τ<sub>lab</sub>* = *γ* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>*\n    A higher Lorentz factor means the particle is moving faster and its observed lifetime is longer.\n\n### **2. Setting up the Equation**\n\n1.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center to the detector wall, a distance equal to the radius *R* = 30 m. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    *t<sub>lab</sub>* = *R* / *v* ≈ *R* / *c*\n\n2.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that reach the wall is determined by their decay over the time of flight, *t<sub>lab</sub>*, using their dilated lifetime, *τ<sub>lab</sub>*:\n    *f* = exp(-*t<sub>lab</sub>* / *τ<sub>lab</sub>*)\n\n3.  **Combining Equations:** Substitute the expressions for *t<sub>lab</sub>* and *τ<sub>lab</sub>*:\n    *f* = exp(-( *R* / *c* ) / ( *γ* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>* ))\n\n4.  **Simplifying:** Notice that *R*, *c*, and *τ<sub>proper</sub>* are all constants for this specific type of particle and experimental setup. We can group them into a single constant, let's call it *A*:\n    *A* = *R* / (*c* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>*)\n    The governing equation becomes:\n    *f* = exp(-*A* / *γ*)\n\n### **3. Solving the Problem**\n\nWe have two scenarios, which allows us to solve for the unknown quantities.\n\n**Scenario 1: Find the constant *A***\n*   Given: A fraction *f₁* = 1/3 of particles survive when the Lorentz factor is *γ₁* = 20.\n*   Plug these values into our equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-*A* / 20)\n*   To solve for *A*, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -*A* / 20\n    -ln(3) = -*A* / 20\n    *A* = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Scenario 2: Find the required Lorentz factor *γ₂***\n*   Goal: Find the Lorentz factor, *γ₂*, that allows a fraction *f₂* = 2/3 of the particles to survive.\n*   Use the same equation with the value of *A* we just found:\n    2/3 = exp(-*A* / *γ₂*)\n    2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / *γ₂*)\n*   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / *γ₂*\n*   Now, rearrange the equation to solve for *γ₂*:\n    *γ₂* = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\n    Since ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3), we can write:\n    *γ₂* = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\n    *γ₂* = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From our derivation, the formula for the new Lorentz factor is:\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\ninitial_gamma = 20.0\ngamma_2 = initial_gamma * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18430722122699\n```\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18. This value is very close to the answer choice 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
