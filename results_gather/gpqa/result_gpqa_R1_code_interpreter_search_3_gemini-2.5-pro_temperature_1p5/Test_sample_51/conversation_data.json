    "This problem requires us to apply the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. We are asked to find the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star develops spots, causing its effective temperature to drop.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a key assumption that allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to relate the population of atomic energy levels to temperature.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to a lower energy state (level 1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2.\n    *   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratio:** The problem states that \"this ratio decreases when the star has spots\". Let's test which ratio, N₁/N₂ or N₂/N₁, fits this description.\n    *   The temperature decreases when spots appear (T_spots < T_nospots).\n    *   Therefore, -1/T decreases (becomes more negative).\n    *   The term `exp(-ΔE / (kT))` will also decrease as T decreases.\n    *   So, the ratio N₂/N₁ decreases as the temperature drops. This matches the problem's description.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio in question is R = N₂ / N₁.\n\n4.  **Define the Factor of Change:** The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n    Factor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\n5.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n    The factor is:\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k*T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spots))\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):** The energy difference ΔE can be found from the wavelength (λ) of the photon corresponding to the transition, using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the term in the exponent is:\n    ΔE/k = (hc) / (λk)\n\n7.  **Identify the Temperatures:** The problem gives us the necessary temperatures:\n    *   Temperature without spots: T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   Overall effective temperature with spots: T_spots = 5500 K\n\n    The other information (star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) is contextual and not required for this calculation, as we are given the initial and final effective temperatures needed for the Boltzmann equation. We will use these effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures of the photosphere in each case.\n\n8.  **Final Formula and Computation:** We have all the pieces to compute the final factor. The calculation will be performed using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n    *   Factor = exp[ ( (h*c)/(λ*k) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nLet's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters\nlambda_A = 1448.0        # Wavelength in Angstroms\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10  # Wavelength in meters\nT_nospots = 6000.0       # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spots = 5500.0         # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Calculate the energy term (delta_E / k)\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (lambda_m * k)\n\n# Calculate the temperature difference term\ntemp_diff_term = (1 / T_spots) - (1 / T_nospots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\n# Factor = (N2/N1)_nospots / (N2/N1)_spots\n# This corresponds to exp[ (delta_E/k) * ( (1/T_spots) - (1/T_nospots) ) ]\nfactor = np.exp(delta_E_over_k * temp_diff_term)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\nfactor=4.506169055919458\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.5.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels changes when a star's temperature decreases. The key physical principle governing the population of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### **1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms `N₂` in a higher energy level `E₂` to the number of atoms `N₁` in a lower energy level `E₁` is given by:\n\n```\nR = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n```\n\nwhere:\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that this ratio *decreases* when spots appear, which means the temperature drops. As `T` decreases, `-1/T` becomes more negative, so `exp(-ΔE / (k*T))` decreases. This confirms that the ratio in question is indeed `N₂ / N₁`.\n\n### **2. Defining the Factor of Change**\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. Let's define the two states:\n\n*   **State 1 (No Spots):** Temperature `T_nospots = 6000 K`. The ratio is `R_nospots`.\n*   **State 2 (With Spots):** Temperature `T_spots = 5500 K`. The ratio is `R_spots`.\n\nThe required factor is `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\n```\nR_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nR_spots   = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n```\n\nDividing the two equations, the `(g₂ / g₁)` term cancels out:\n\n```\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\n```\n\nUsing the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n\n```\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n```\n\n### **3.

The energy of a photon is `E = hc/λ`.\n\nSo, `ΔE = hc/λ`, and the term `ΔE/k` becomes `hc/(λk)`.\n\n### **4. Computation**\n\nWe have all the necessary components to calculate the factor.
