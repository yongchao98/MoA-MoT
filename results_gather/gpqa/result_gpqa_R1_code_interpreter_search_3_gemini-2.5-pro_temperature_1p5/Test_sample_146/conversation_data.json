    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Annihilation is a process where a particle and its antiparticle collide and their mass is converted into energy, which then materializes as other particles.\n\n2.  **Identify Conservation Laws:** In any particle interaction, energy and momentum are conserved.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states, \"The antiproton is slowly moving.\" This is a key phrase. In the context of high-energy physics problems, \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the particle is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. A reasonable and standard assumption here is that both the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest before they annihilate. This means we can consider the annihilation to happen in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{initial}$):** If both particles are at rest (or moving very slowly towards each other with equal and opposite velocity), the total initial momentum is zero. $\\vec{p}_{initial} \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** With negligible kinetic energy, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n        *   A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass ($m_p$).\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n        *   Therefore, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{final}$):** From conservation of momentum, $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{initial} \\approx 0$. The total momentum of the four outgoing particles must be zero. This means they fly off in different directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n        *   $E_{final} = E_{A1^+} + E_{A2^+} + E_{A1^-} + E_{A2^-}$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Conservation Laws to Solve for Velocity:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the velocity of particle A,\" implying that all four final particles have the same speed. For the total momentum to be zero and energy to be conserved, the most symmetric and simplest outcome is that the total available energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each final particle is $E_A = E_{initial} / 4$.\n    *   We can now set up the equation:\n        $E_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} m_p c^2$.\n    *   We also know that the energy of one of these particles is given by the relativistic formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $E_A$:\n        $\\gamma m_A c^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_p c^2$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$.\n    *   Finally, we can find the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$. The relationship is $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   I will use the following values:\n        *   $m_p c^2 = 938.27$ MeV (Rest mass energy of a proton)\n        *   $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV (Given)\n    *   To make the calculation precise, I'll use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total initial energy.\n# Assuming annihilation from rest, the initial energy is the sum of the rest masses.\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy per final particle.\n# The initial energy is distributed equally among the four final particles.\nnum_final_particles = 4\nE_A = E_initial / num_final_particles\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A.\n# The energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c^2\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate beta (v/c) from the Lorentz factor.\n# The relationship is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), which rearranges to beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - (1 / (gamma**2)))\n\n# Print the result to see the final value of beta.\nprint(f\"The calculated value of beta (v/c) is: {beta}\")\n```\n<<<\nThe velocity of particle A is determined by the conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The annihilation happens between a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$), which are assumed to be nearly at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The initial energy is converted into four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). By symmetry, the energy is distributed equally among them.\n    *   Energy per particle A, $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The total energy of a particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m_A c^2$ is its rest mass energy.\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   We can find the Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.564$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity:** The Lorentz factor is related to velocity ($v$) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can solve for $v/c$ (also denoted as $\\beta$).\n    *   $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689$.\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
