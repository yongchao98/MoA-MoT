    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:**\n    The problem specifies a rhombohedral crystal.\n    The given parameters are:\n    *   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom (The \"interatomic distance\" is interpreted as the length of the primitive lattice vectors).\n    *   Interaxial angle, α = β = γ = 30°.\n    *   Miller indices of the plane, (hkl) = (111).\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is given by:\n    `1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the specific case of the (111) plane, we have h = k = l = 1. Let's substitute these values into the formula.\n    *   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\n    The numerator becomes:\n    `3sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α)) = 3sin^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Using the identity `sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`:\n    `3(1 - cos^2(α)) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α) = 3 - 3cos^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    `= 3cos^2(α) - 6cos(α) + 3 = 3(cos^2(α) - 2cos(α) + 1) = 3(1 - cos(α))^2`\n\n    The volume factor in the denominator can be factored as:\n    `1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α) = (1 - cos(α))^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))`\n\n    Substituting these simplified parts back into the main formula:\n    `1/d_111^2 = [3(1 - cos(α))^2] / [a^2 * (1 - cos(α))^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n    As long as `cos(α) ≠ 1` (i.e., `α ≠ 0`), we can cancel the `(1 - cos(α))^2` term, leading to a much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [a^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Value:**\n    Now, substitute the given numerical values into this simplified formula:\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2`\n\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [10^2 * (1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2))]`\n    `1/d_111^2 = 3 / [100 * (1 + sqrt(3))]`\n\n    Now, solve for `d_111`:\n    `d_111^2 = [100 * (1 + sqrt(3))] / 3`\n    `d_111 = sqrt([100 * (1 + sqrt(3))] / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + sqrt(3)) / 3)`\n\n    Using the value `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205`:\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt((1 + 1.73205) / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt(2.73205 / 3)`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt(0.91068)`\n    `d_111 ≈ 10 * 0.9543`\n    `d_111 ≈ 9.543` Angstrom\n\nTo ensure high precision, we can perform the calculation using a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters\na = 10.0  # Lattice parameter in Angstroms\nalpha_deg = 30.0  # Interaxial angle in degrees\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1 # Miller indices\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Using the simplified formula for the (111) plane: 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\ninv_d_squared = 3 / (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha))\n\n# Calculate d by taking the square root of the reciprocal\nd_111 = math.sqrt(1 / inv_d_squared)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\n<execute_code>\n9.54297485303953\n</execute_code>\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.543 Angstrom.

    "The interplanar distance `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral crystal is given by the formula:\n\n`1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `(hkl) = (111)`\n\nFirst, let's substitute `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1` into the formula.\n*   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nThe formula becomes:\n`1/d_111^2 = [3sin^2(α) + 2(3)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\nLet's simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.\n**Numerator:**\n`3sin^2(α) + 6(cos^2(α) - cos(α))`\nUsing the identity `sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`:\n`= 3(1 - cos^2(α)) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`= 3 - 3cos^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`= 3 + 3cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n`= 3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos^2(α))`\n`= 3(1 - cos(α))^2`\n\n**Denominator:**\nThe term `(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))` can be factored. It is a cubic polynomial in terms of `cos(α)`. We can see that if `cos(α)=1`, the expression is `1 - 3 + 2 = 0`, so `(cos(α)-1)` is a factor.
