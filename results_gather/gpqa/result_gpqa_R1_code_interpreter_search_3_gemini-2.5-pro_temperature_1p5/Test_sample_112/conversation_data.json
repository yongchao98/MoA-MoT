    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The observation of these specific peaks provides direct confirmation of the alkene group that was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of C = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of O = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of H = 1 amu\n        *   Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The presence of this fragment provides definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **Functional Groups Identified:** The data from all three techniques consistently indicates the presence of two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) `C6H12O` and D) `C6H10O`, which only have one oxygen atom.\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. We can calculate the DoU based on the identified functional groups and also from the molecular formulas.\n        *   **DoU from Functional Groups:**\n            *   One C=O bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n            *   One C=C bond (in the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n            *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = 2.\n        *   **DoU from Molecular Formulas:** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n            *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n            *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound must have a degree of unsaturation of 2 to account for both the carboxylic acid's carbonyl group and the alkene's double bond. Only the formula **C6H10O2** has a DoU of 2. The formula C6H12O2, with a DoU of 1, would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C double bond from both FTIR and NMR.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a key indicator, resulting from strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H peak is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (protons attached to the C=C double bond) directly confirms the presence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern. This mass corresponds to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Atomic mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16\n        *   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragmentation strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **Functional Groups:** The data from all three techniques confirms the presence of two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This fact immediately eliminates options C) C6H12O and D) C6H10O, which only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a measure of the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. We can calculate it for the remaining formulas and compare it to what our identified functional groups require.\n        *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The C=C bond in the alkene accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence for an alkene.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and has two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl group and the alkene double bond.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a key signature. While C-H stretches also appear around 3000 cm⁻¹, a \"very broad\" peak in this region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is typical for carboxylic acid dimers.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls squarely in the absorption range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. The combination of a broad O-H peak and a C=O peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the alkene functional group suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. We can calculate its composition:\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Total mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The observation of this fragment provides a third, independent piece of evidence confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **Functional Groups Identified:** The collective data from all three techniques point to two functional groups: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain exactly **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) `C6H12O` and D) `C6H10O`, which only have one oxygen.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This is the final step to distinguish between the remaining options, A) `C6H10O2` and B) `C6H12O2`. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n        *   From our identified functional groups, we have:\n            *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n            *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n            *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n        *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the candidate formulas using the standard formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (oxygens don't affect the calculation).\n            *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n            *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chemical formula `C6H10O2` has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the evidence for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. The formula `C6H12O2` (e.g., hexanoic acid) only has one degree of unsaturation, which would not account for the alkene group proven to exist by FTIR and NMR.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound's chemical formula must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
