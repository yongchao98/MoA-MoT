    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we should convert this potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).

Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now separated into a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis form is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

Understand the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nTo solve this problem, it's often best to see if the potential simplifies in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can identify two key terms in the potential:\n1.  r² = x² + y²\n2.  r² cos²(θ) = (r cos(θ))² = x²\n\nNow, I will substitute these Cartesian expressions back into the potential V(r, θ) to get V(x, y).\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\n\n**2.

We assume the total wavefunction is a product of two 1D wavefunctions, ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x)ψ_y(y), and the total energy is a sum of the energies for each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.
