    "This problem requires us to determine the ratio of the total masses of two binary star systems using observational data. The key information is the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K) for the stars in each system.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2), which is M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K1_1) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K1_2) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K2_1) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K2_2) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physics Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    M_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the total mass of the binary system.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the plane of the orbit and the plane of the sky).\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses\". An eclipse can only occur if the system is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass formula to:\n\n    M_total ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. Using the simplified formula:\n\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n    The constant term (1 / (2πG)) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This leaves us with a much simpler ratio:\n\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) ]³\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:** Now, we plug the given values into the formula. I will use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   Sum of amplitudes for System 1: K1_total = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   Sum of amplitudes for System 2: K2_total = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    The calculation will be `(2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Define the parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1_1 + K1_2\nK2_total = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\n# Ratio = (P1/P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * ((K1_total / K2_total) ** 3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:** The calculated ratio is 0.432.

    "### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law.** For a spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) through a form of Kepler's Third Law.
