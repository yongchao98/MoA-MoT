    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum resolution of a detector needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays. This involves concepts from special relativity and the exponential law of radioactive decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame than in its own rest frame (proper lifetime). This phenomenon is called time dilation. Consequently, the distance it travels before decaying is also longer in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the energy of a particle in the lab frame (E) to its rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²).\n    *   Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c², which means the rest energy E₀ = 3.41 GeV.\n    *   The formula is E = γ * E₀.\n    *   γ = E / E₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame (L):** The proper lifetime (τ₀) is the average lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the average lifetime (τ) is dilated by the Lorentz factor: τ = γ * τ₀.\n    *   Proper lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying (the mean decay length, L) is its speed multiplied by its lab lifetime. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its speed is approximately c.\n    *   L = c * τ = c * γ * τ₀\n    *   L = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * 7.918 * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 1.90 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Apply the Decay Law and the Observation Condition:** The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle travels at least a distance `x` before decaying is given by P(distance ≥ x) = exp(-x / L).\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it `x_res`.\n    *   Therefore, the fraction of observed decays is the probability that a particle travels a distance greater than `x_res`.\n    *   Fraction observed = exp(-x_res / L)\n    *   The problem states that we need to observe *at least* 30% of the decays.\n    *   exp(-x_res / L) ≥ 0.30\n\n5.  **Solve for the Resolution (x_res):** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is typically interpreted as finding the boundary condition for the detector's capability. A smaller `x_res` means a better detector that can see shorter tracks and thus observe more decays. A larger `x_res` means a worse detector. The condition `exp(-x_res / L) ≥ 0.30` sets an upper limit on `x_res`. Any resolution smaller than this limit will work. We are asked to find this limit, which represents the largest (i.e., coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the condition.\n    *   We solve the equality: exp(-x_res / L) = 0.30\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -x_res / L = ln(0.30)\n    *   x_res = -L * ln(0.30)\n    *   Using ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204:\n    *   x_res = -(1.90 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.29 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** Our calculated value is approximately 2.29 × 10⁻⁶ m. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\n    B) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\n    C) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n    D) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n    The value 2.29 × 10⁻⁶ m is closest in both magnitude and order to option D, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m. The small discrepancy (about 10%) is likely due to a slight inconsistency between the numbers provided in the problem statement and the options (e.g., a typo in the lifetime or mass). Given the choices, option D is the only plausible answer.\n\nTo verify with higher precision, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE_GeV = 27.0\nm0_GeV = 3.41\ntau0_s = 8e-16\nc_ms = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\npercentage_to_observe = 0.30\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor\ngamma = E_GeV / m0_GeV\n\n# Calculate mean decay length in the lab frame\nL = gamma * c_ms * tau0_s\n\n# Calculate the maximum resolution that satisfies the condition\n# x_res = -L * ln(percentage_to_observe)\nresolution = -L * np.log(percentage_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.286370213709087e-06\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution of the CERN Bubble Chamber required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰. This means we need to find the track length that corresponds to this observation probability.\n\n**2. Relativistic Effects: Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe particle X⁰ is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). This means it's traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light, and we must use principles of special relativity.\n\n*   A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory's frame of reference compared to its own rest frame. This is called time dilation.\n*   The key parameter is the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma), which relates the total energy (E) to the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²).\n*   Total Energy in the lab frame, E = 27 GeV.\n*   Rest Energy, E₀ = 3.41 GeV.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    γ = E / E₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame (L)**\nThe *proper lifetime* (τ₀) is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. Due to time dilation, its average lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is longer: τ = γ * τ₀.\nThe average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length (L). Since the particle is highly relativistic, its speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n\n*   Proper lifetime, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s.\n*   Speed of light, c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s.\n*   Mean decay length, L = v * τ ≈ c * (γ * τ₀).\n*   L ≈ (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * 7.918 * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n*   L ≈ 1.90 × 10⁻⁶ meters.\n\n**4. Use the Exponential Decay Law**\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential law. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance `x` before decaying is given by:\nP(survival to distance x) = e^(-x / L)\n\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle must be at least as long as the detector's resolution, which we'll call `x_res`. Therefore, the fraction of observed decays is the probability that the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to `x_res`.\n\n*   Fraction of observed decays = P(distance traveled ≥ x_res) = e^(-x_res / L)\n\n**5. Solve for the Resolution (x_res)**\nThe problem requires that we observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This gives us the following inequality:\ne^(-x_res / L) ≥ 0.30\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". In this context, this is typically interpreted as the coarsest (i.e., largest) possible resolution value that still satisfies the condition. A detector with a finer (smaller) resolution would observe an even greater percentage of decays. We find this boundary value by solving the equation:\ne^(-x_res / L) = 0.30\n\nTo solve for `x_res`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-x_res / L = ln(0.30)\n\nNow, we solve for `x_res`:\nx_res = -L * ln(0.30)\nx_res ≈ -(1.90 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\nx_res ≈ 2.29 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**6.

Let's look at the options:\nA) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\nB) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\nC) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\nD) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value (2.29 × 10⁻⁶ m) is extremely close to option D (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m). The other options are different by several orders of magnitude. The minor discrepancy between 2.29 and 2.08 is likely due to rounding or slight inconsistencies in the problem's provided values versus the options. Option D is the only physically plausible answer.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, let's use a script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0_GeV = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0_s = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc_ms = 299792458.0  # Precise speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.
