    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the aperture.**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is a circle.\n    The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the physical phenomenon.**\n    When monochromatic light passes through an aperture, it undergoes diffraction. Since the observation is in the far-field region, this is Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locate the minima of the diffraction pattern.**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius `r` is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * r * sin(θ)) / (k * r * sin(θ))]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center.\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `r` is the radius of the aperture, which is `a` in our case.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n    The minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero. The problem assumes that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    The condition for the minima becomes:\n    `J₁(k * a * θ) = 0`\n    This means that the argument `k * a * θ` must be equal to one of the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `x_m` be the m-th zero of `J₁(x)`.\n    So, `k * a * θ_m = x_m`\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum:\n    `θ_m = x_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Find the positions of the first two minima.**\n    We need the first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n    *   The first zero, `x₁`, is approximately 3.8317.\n    *   The second zero, `x₂`, is approximately 7.0156.\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima (`θ₁` and `θ₂`):\n    *   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = x₁ * λ / (2π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a)`\n    *   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = x₂ * λ / (2π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ = [x₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [x₁ * λ / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (x₂ - x₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n    Now, let's compute the numerical coefficient:\n    `Coefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.5067`\n\n    So, the angular distance is:\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\n*   **Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value `0.5067 λ / a` is very close to option B.\n    A) 1.220 λ /a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 0.500 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
