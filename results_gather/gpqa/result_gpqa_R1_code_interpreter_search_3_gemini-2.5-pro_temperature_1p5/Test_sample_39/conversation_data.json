    "This is a classic piece of chemist slang. In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, a primary method for purifying and analyzing mixtures of compounds is chromatography, especially Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.\n\n1.  **Chromatography basics:** These techniques separate compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (commonly polar silica gel) and a mobile phase (a less polar organic solvent or solvent mixture called the eluent).\n2.  **How separation works:** Polar compounds stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move slowly. Less polar compounds are more soluble in the mobile phase and move more quickly. This difference in movement allows for separation.\n3.  **The problem:** If two or more compounds in a mixture have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way.\n4.  **The visual result:**\n    *   On a TLC plate, instead of separating into distinct spots at different heights, the compounds will travel together, resulting in a single, overlapping spot. Visually, the spots are \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   In column chromatography, the compounds would exit the column at the same time (co-elute), meaning the collected fractions would not be pure. If the separation were being monitored by a detector, the resulting chromatogram would show one broad, unresolved peak instead of two or more sharp, separated peaks. The peaks are \"on top of each other.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) While non-covalent interactions are the basis for polarity, the specific problem described is the *consequence* of those interactions leading to similar behavior during separation, not that the molecules are forming stable complexes with each other.\n*   C) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more characteristic of chromatography.\n*   D) Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is used for characterization, not typically for separation (unless using specialized chiral chromatography, but even then, the underlying principle of separation failure would be similar affinity for the chiral stationary phase, which is a more specific case of the general polarity/affinity issue).\n\nTherefore, the most direct and common meaning of \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is that they have failed to separate during chromatography because their polarities are too similar.\n\n<<<B>>>",
