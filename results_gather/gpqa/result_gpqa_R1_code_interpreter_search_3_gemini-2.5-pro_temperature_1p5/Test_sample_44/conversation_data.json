    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the multi-particle states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n`E_n = n² * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   `E_1 = 1² * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2² * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3² * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4² * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\").\n\nThis means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available states (one spin up, one spin down). Consequently, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Constructing the Multi-Particle States**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four individual particles. To find the energies of the ground state and excited states, we must distribute the four particles among the available single-particle levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Ground State:**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the lowest available energy levels.\n    *   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * E`.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, `n=2`. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is `E_ground = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}\n\n*   **First Excited State:**\n    To find the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy configuration that is higher than the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Starting from the ground state configuration, we take one particle from the `n=2` level and \"excite\" it to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   The total energy for this state is `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:**\n    This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Excite the second particle from `n=2` in the ground state to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3}.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Excite one particle from `n=1` in the ground state to the lowest available level, `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: {1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n        *   Energy: `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 3:** Excite the highest particle from the *first excited state* (the one in `n=3`) to the next level (`n=4`).\n        *   Configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4}.\n        *   Energy: `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n    Comparing the possible energies for the second excited state (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option B.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Single-Particle System**\n\nThe problem involves a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.

We do this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the next available empty level.\n    *   Start with the ground state configuration: {2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2}.\n    *   Promote one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is: {2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3}.\n    *   Total First Excited State Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)**\n    This is the state with the next lowest energy.
