This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, which is an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron.\n\n2.  **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   Each Deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n\n3.  **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents. This points to a common reagent that has a deuterated version.\n    *   **Reducing Agent**: The reaction of X with a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., in a -CO-COOH group) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This means both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups were reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (which has two -OH groups). This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Identity**: The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues. It is a powerful reducing agent, contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, and its non-deuterated analog is extremely common.\n\n4.  **The Overall Reaction**: Let's verify the entire sequence with X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas must involve Y being a source of deuterium, so Y = D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases B. Heating Al(OD)₃ causes it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B): `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   All clues are perfectly consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: The lightest element is determined by the lowest atomic number (Z), and the heaviest by the highest atomic number.\n    *   Lightest: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n    *   Heaviest: Aluminum (Z=13)\n*   **Sum the Masses**: The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 atom × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated value is 35. We now match this result to the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 25\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Isotope Identification**: The melting point of B is the key to identifying the heavy isotope as Deuterium.\n*   **Lightest/Heaviest Element**: This is determined by atomic number (protons), not atomic mass. Li (Z=3) is heavier than H (Z=1).\n*   **Summation Rule**: The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements (i.e., 4 Deuterium atoms and 1 Aluminum atom).\n*   **Mapping to Options**: A common error is correctly calculating the value but selecting the wrong letter. It is crucial to map the calculated number (35) to the correct option letter from the original list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as **Deuterium (D)**, which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W**: The gas W, which is released during the reaction, has molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Given that the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   It contains Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent. This points to a common deuterated reagent, where the non-deuterated version is widely used.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This signifies a powerful reduction reaction that converts both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into alcohol groups (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the clues.\n\n### Verification of the Reaction\n\nLet's verify the entire chemical process with X = LiAlD₄.\n*   The violent reaction of Substance X with liquid Y produces gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. For this to occur, Y must be heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n*   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O). This is consistent with the thermal decomposition of a metal deuteroxide: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   All clues are perfectly consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element**: The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Instruction**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to solve this problem involves a systematic analysis of the chemical clues provided, followed by a precise calculation based on the findings.

Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 K) gives approximately 3.85 °C. This is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that B is D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" involved is Deuterium (D). This conclusion is consistently reached by all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since we know Deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains Deuterium.\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry with a very common analog.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent for this purpose is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n    *   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` explains the violent reaction, the production of D₂ gas (W), and the formation of a precipitate G (Aluminum Deuteroxide), which upon heating releases D₂O (B). This confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum.\n    *   **Instruction:** Sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D).

    "Based on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the final, correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The first and most critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   This value is extremely close to the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), whereas normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C.\n    *   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is D₂O**. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules that \"contain the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   A Deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly satisfying the condition.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   It contains Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry with a \"very close analog\" that is also commonly used. This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n    *   The reaction sequence is also consistent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate G (Aluminum Deuteroxide), which upon heating releases B (D₂O).\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** This is determined by atomic number (Z). The lightest is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is not part of the calculation.\n    *   **Summation:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass number of the specific isotopes.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of the stable Aluminum (²⁷Al) isotope. The mass number of Al is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Isotope Identification:** The correct identification of D₂O from its melting point is the key that unlocks the entire puzzle.\n*   **Lightest/Heaviest Element Definition:** The selection of the lightest and heaviest elements must be based on atomic number (H and Al), not atomic mass.\n*   **Use of Isotope Mass:** The calculation requires using the mass number of the specific isotope (Deuterium, mass=2), not the average atomic mass of hydrogen from the periodic table.\n*   **Summation Rule:** The phrase \"cumulative atomic masses\" and the instruction to sum the masses of \"all\" instances means you must account for the stoichiometry within the molecule (i.e., four Deuterium atoms).\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final calculated value of 35 must be correctly matched to the given options: A) 29, B) 31, C) 25, D) 35.\n\nThe correct calculation yields 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a near-perfect match.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is D₂O. This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:**\n    *   **Clue:** A molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   **Analysis:** Since the reaction involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate for the gas is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 2:** It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common deuterated reagent.\n    *   **Clue 3:** Its reaction with a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates it is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (a diol).\n    *   **Analysis:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. LiAlH₄ is strong enough to perform the described reduction, whereas milder agents like NaBH₄ are not.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's assume X is LiAlD₄. The violent reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to produce D₂ gas) would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When heated, the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes to release D₂O (B). This entire sequence is chemically consistent and confirms the identities of all substances.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** By atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Instruction:** The masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements must be summed. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2. There are **four** D atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (Al), with a mass number of 27. There is **one** Al atom.\n*   **Summation:**\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield a value of 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Chemical Clues**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each unknown substance.\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius (277 K - 273.15) gives 3.85 °C. This is almost identical to the known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**, and the heavier isotope involved in the problem is Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X**: Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    1.  It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium.\n    2.  Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". This suggests a deuterated version of a common reagent.\n    3.  It reduces a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups. The most common reagent with this strength is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    4.  Therefore, the deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, is the most likely candidate for Substance X.\n\n*   **Verification of the Reaction**: Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction description. X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields B (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose and release heavy water, B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent, confirming that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **2. Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum the Masses**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: The final value is the sum of these masses.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nThe logical deduction and calculation consistently yield the value 35. The provided options are:\nA) 29\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
