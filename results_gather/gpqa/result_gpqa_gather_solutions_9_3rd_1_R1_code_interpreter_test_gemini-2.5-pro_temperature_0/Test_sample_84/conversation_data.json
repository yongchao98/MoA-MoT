When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (constant $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) with the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship with the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combining Ratios:** Now, we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Using Doppler Shift Data:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} $$\n    Substituting this into our final formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** We plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_{p2}/M_{p1} = 5 M_{Earth} / 7 M_{Earth} = 5/7$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 \\text{ Å} / 0.04 \\text{ Å} = 3/4$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific spectral line, are not needed for the final calculation. They are included to make the problem more realistic but are irrelevant for the ratio.\n*   **Justification for $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$:** The problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is a critical piece of information, as it justifies assuming the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°, which makes $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **Correct Indices:** It is crucial to keep the indices correct throughout the derivation. The final formula has the mass ratio as $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and the Doppler shift ratio as $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculation consistently yields a value of ~0.536. The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this value to the given options. Based on the question's option list, ~0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets (Planet 1 and Planet 2), expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n3.  **Simplifying with Transit Data**: A crucial detail is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°, which means we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. When we form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$, the constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Combination**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Using Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### 3. Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out. This is a common way to test a deep understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **The Role of the Transit Method**: The mention of the transit method is not superfluous. It is the key piece of information that justifies the critical assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$, allowing $\\sin(i)$ to be treated as 1.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly perform the physical derivation and the numerical calculation. The discrepancies between their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stem from inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options or errors in matching the calculated number to the correct letter. The physics and math are sound across all of them.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nUsing the final derived formula and the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately **0.536**. Comparing this result to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the correct physical derivation that is consistently used across the provided candidate answers. I will then identify any potential pitfalls or sources of error, such as irrelevant information or misinterpretation of the problem statement. Finally, I will use a Python script to perform the calculation based on the derived formula and determine the correct option from the choices provided in the original question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their temperatures simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which justifies assuming the orbital inclination is edge-on ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$), so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging this formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Formula**: Substituting the result from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1 gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to calculate the final ratio. They are provided as context.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method**: The mention of the transit method is crucial because it justifies the assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which simplifies the radial velocity formula.\n*   **Source of Error in Candidate Answers**: The provided candidate answers almost universally derive the correct physics and calculate the correct numerical value (~0.5357). The primary source of error is in matching this value to the correct lettered option, as the options are sometimes listed in a different order.

To find the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, we divide their respective equations:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} $$\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant and cancel out. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so this term also cancels. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    We can simplify this by considering a crucial piece of information.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** To find the ratio $a_2/a_1$, we first rearrange the formula for $K$ to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2} $$\n    Now, we form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the inclination ($i$) will cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Ratios and Use Doppler Shift Data:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$): 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$): 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$): 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$): 0.04 Å\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options, it is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the final ratio and can be considered distractors.\n*   **Justification for $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$:** The fact that the planets were detected using the **transit method** is critical. Transits are only observable when the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. This justifies the simplification of the RV formula by assuming $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Doppler Shift Interpretation:** The phrase \"periodic shift of up to...\" refers to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), which is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$).\n*   **Index Tracking:** It is important to correctly track the indices (1 and 2) through the derivation. The final formula shows that the temperature ratio is proportional to the inverse ratio of the masses ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) but the direct ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them correctly derived the physics and performed the calculation. The main source of discrepancy was in matching the numerical result to the correct lettered option, as the option lists were scrambled in the provided answers. The calculation consistently yields ~0.536, which corresponds to option D in the original question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. The solution involves combining the formulas for planetary equilibrium temperature and stellar radial velocity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    When we take the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the terms for the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data:**\n    The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n    A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Derivation and Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$).

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit where the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (justified by the transit detection method), the formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Final Formula Derivation**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root cancels the squares, yielding:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Using Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Mass Ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the temperature ratio. They are included as contextual details that are not part of the final calculation.\n*   **Significance of Transit Method**: The problem states that the planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. The mention of the transit method is crucial because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.536. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to errors in matching the calculated value to the options, which were presented in a shuffled order in some cases. The underlying physics and math are unanimously correct.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 0.5357. This value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$), based on data obtained from transit and radial velocity observations.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{eff}$ is the star's temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n    When taking the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and with the same albedo ($A$ is constant), these terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that the planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n    By rearranging this formula to solve for $a$, we get $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Formula Derivation:** We can now substitute this expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This gives us:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the ratio. They provide context but are not used in the final calculation.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The problem states that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. The transit method is only possible when a planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i$ is very close to 90° for both planets. Therefore, we can make the crucial assumption that $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, which causes the inclination term $(\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1))$ to cancel out.\n*   **Final Simplified Formula:** With the inclination term removed, the final formula for the calculation is remarkably simple:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_earth}}{7 \\text{ M_earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis calculated value is closest to **0.53**.

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (constant $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) and having the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship based on their semi-major axes ($a$):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n3.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Final Formula:** We substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation. The square root cancels the squared terms:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Using Doppler Shift Data:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). This gives us the final formula for calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **3.

This is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This crucial simplification shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be found using the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n    A key piece of information is that the planets were detected via the **transit method**, which means their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This justifies the assumption that the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Now we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$.

Deconstruction of the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left(\\frac{R_*}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n*   **Simplifying the Ratio:** When we form the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant and cancel out. The problem also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo ($A$), so this term also cancels.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} (\\frac{R_*}{2a_1})^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} (\\frac{R_*}{2a_2})^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This crucial simplification shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n*   **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    A key piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which is only possible if the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\n*   **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Rearranging the simplified RV formula to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n    Now, we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Final Formula:** We substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ (i.e., $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$), the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n    This gives us the final, elegant formula for the calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **3.

The ratio to be found is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 2a: Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\nWhen we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) and the albedo ($A$, which is given as the same for both planets) cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial simplification shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2b: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) using the formula for a circular orbit:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nA key piece of information is that the planets were detected via the **transit method**, which is only possible if the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. This justifies the approximation $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**Step 2c: Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the expression for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 2d: Combine Formulas and Substitute Doppler Shift Data**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ (since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nThis gives the final formula for the calculation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$): 0.04 Å\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Consensus on Method:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physical principles and derived the same final formula.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical result to be approximately 0.536.\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are extraneous details not required for the final ratio calculation.\n*   **Importance of Transit Method:** The mention of the transit method is critical as it justifies assuming the orbital inclination is ~90°, which simplifies the RV formula.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to the value `~ 0.53`. In the original question's option list, this corresponds to option B. The confusion in the candidate answers stems from inconsistent lettering of the options, but the numerical result is undisputed.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Goal**\nThe main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These common terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n### **4. Apply Careful Points and Simplifications**\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio. They are contextual details that cancel out.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Term:** A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the sine terms cancel from the ratio.\n*   **Doppler Shift and RV Amplitude:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ it causes ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the ratio of the semi-major axes becomes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### **5. Final Derivation and Calculation**\nSubstitute this result back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **6.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including a list of careful points, to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    When we form the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    This simplification shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n    As noted in the \"Careful Points\" below, the mention of the transit method justifies assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Calculate:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    The calculated value is approximately 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the derivation. They are included to test a complete understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$). This justifies the key assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. RV Amplitude:** It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$) in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$).\n*   **Index Consistency:** Throughout the derivation, it is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent to avoid inverting a ratio by mistake. The final formula correctly combines the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) with the Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculation consistently yields a result of ~0.536. This numerical result must be correctly matched to the corresponding lettered option from the original question.\n\nBased on the calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the physical derivation and the numerical calculation. The discrepancies arise from matching the calculated result to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (constant $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) with the same albedo (constant $A$), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$.\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Derivation:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n    Since the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$): $5/7$\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$): $0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4$\n    *   Inclination Ratio ($\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$): Since both planets are detected by the transit method, we must assume their inclinations are nearly identical and close to 90°, making this ratio equal to 1.\n\n    The final calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio. They are included to test the understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Significance of the Transit Method:** The problem states that both planets were detected by the transit and RV methods. The transit detection is crucial because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i_1$ and $i_2$) are both approximately 90°, meaning $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. This makes the inclination ratio term equal to 1, allowing for a solution.\n*   **Correct Indices:** The final formula correctly uses the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (indices inverted relative to the temperature ratio) and the Doppler shift ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$ (indices in the same order).\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the physics and arrive at the numerical result of approximately 0.536.

The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal Identification**: The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio Simplification**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$.\n    For two planets orbiting the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$). When forming the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, these constant terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler relationship:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $$ a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2} $$\n    Now, we form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out. As explained in the \"Careful Points\" below, the $\\sin(i)$ term also cancels.\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Derivation**: Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: We plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out during the derivation. They are included to test a complete understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Significance of the Transit Method**: The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit method is only possible if a planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$). This justifies the key assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets, which simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Index Consistency**: Throughout the derivation, it is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent. Note that the final formula involves the inverse ratio of the masses ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) but the direct ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Consensus on the Result**: All 15 candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices, correctly derive the physics and calculate the numerical result to be approximately 0.536. The discrepancies in the final letter are due to inconsistent option lists and can be disregarded.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (constant $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) with the same albedo (constant $A$), all these terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship with the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit:\n    $$ K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2} $$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combining Ratios:** Now, we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Using Doppler Shift Data:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} $$\n    Substituting this into our final formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** We plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_{p2}/M_{p1} = 5 M_{Earth} / 7 M_{Earth} = 5/7$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 \\text{ Å} / 0.04 \\text{ Å} = 3/4$\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific spectral line, are not needed for the final calculation. They are included to make the problem more realistic but are irrelevant for the ratio.\n*   **Justification for $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$:** The problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is a critical piece of information, as it justifies assuming the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°, which makes $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **Correct Indices:** It is crucial to keep the indices correct throughout the derivation. The final formula has the mass ratio as $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ and the Doppler shift ratio as $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculation consistently yields a value of ~0.536. The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this value to the given options. Based on the question's option list, ~0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem\n\nThe core task is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets (Planet 1 and Planet 2), expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and having the same albedo ($A$ is constant), all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) cancel out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n3.  **Simplifying with Transit Data**: A crucial detail is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°, which means we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. When we form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$, the constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Combination**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Using Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### 3. Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out. This is a common way to test a deep understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **The Role of the Transit Method**: The mention of the transit method is not superfluous.

Finally, I will use a Python script to perform the calculation based on the derived formula and determine the correct option from the choices provided in the original question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the ratio of their temperatures simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which justifies assuming the orbital inclination is edge-on ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$), so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging this formula to solve for $a$ gives $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Formula**: Substituting the result from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1 gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to calculate the final ratio.

To find the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, we divide their respective equations:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} $$\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's effective temperature ($T_{eff}$) and radius ($R_*$) are constant and cancel out. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so this term also cancels. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} $$\n    We can simplify this by considering a crucial piece of information.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** To find the ratio $a_2/a_1$, we first rearrange the formula for $K$ to solve for $a$:\n    $$ K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2} $$\n    Now, we form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the inclination ($i$) will cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n\n5.  **Combine Ratios and Use Doppler Shift Data:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the $K$ values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$): 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$): 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$): 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$): 0.04 Å\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options, it is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to calculate the final ratio and can be considered distractors.\n*   **Justification for $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$:** The fact that the planets were detected using the **transit method** is critical. Transits are only observable when the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. This justifies the simplification of the RV formula by assuming $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Doppler Shift Interpretation:** The phrase \"periodic shift of up to...\" refers to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), which is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$).\n*   **Index Tracking:** It is important to correctly track the indices (1 and 2) through the derivation.

The solution involves combining the formulas for planetary equilibrium temperature and stellar radial velocity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\n    When we take the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star, the terms for the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are constant. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data:**\n    The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet induces on its star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n    A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\n    Rearranging to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Derivation and Calculation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n    The final formula is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.98\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.53\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) that is not needed to calculate the final ratio. This tests the understanding of the underlying physical relationships.\n*   **Transit Method:** The mention of the transit method is essential as it justifies assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), which simplifies the radial velocity equation.\n*   **Ratios vs. Absolute Values:** The problem is solved entirely with ratios, which simplifies the calculations by canceling out physical constants ($G$) and system parameters ($M_*$, $R_*$, $T_{eff}$, $A$).\n*   **Correct Formula Application:** It is important to correctly combine the formulas. The final result shows that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) but directly proportional to the Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the physical derivation and the numerical result of ~0.536.

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are constant) and sharing the same albedo ($A$ is constant), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit where the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (justified by the transit detection method), the formula is $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Final Formula Derivation**: We substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root cancels the squares, yielding:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Using Doppler Shift Data**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, their ratios are equal: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. The final formula for calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Mass Ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the temperature ratio. They are included as contextual details that are not part of the final calculation.\n*   **Significance of Transit Method**: The problem states that the planets were detected using both transit and RV methods. The mention of the transit method is crucial because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, which allows for the simplification $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and perform the calculation to arrive at the numerical result of ~0.536.

For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n    By rearranging this formula to solve for $a$, we get $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$. The ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets is therefore:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Final Formula Derivation:** We can now substitute this expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is identical to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$. This gives us:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass (1.5 M_Sun), radius (1.2 R_Sun), and temperature (6300 K), as well as the planets' radii, are not required to solve for the ratio. They provide context but are not used in the final calculation.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The problem states that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. The transit method is only possible when a planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i$ is very close to 90° for both planets. Therefore, we can make the crucial assumption that $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, which causes the inclination term $(\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1))$ to cancel out.\n*   **Final Simplified Formula:** With the inclination term removed, the final formula for the calculation is remarkably simple:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_earth}}{7 \\text{ M_earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis calculated value is closest to **0.53**.

For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    A key piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which is only possible if the orbital inclination ($i$) is close to 90°. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\n*   **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Rearranging the simplified RV formula to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n    Now, we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n*   **Final Formula:** We substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    Since the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ (i.e., $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$), the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n    This gives us the final, elegant formula for the calculation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **3.

Deconstruction of the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star. The ratio to be found is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 2a: Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo.\n\nWhen we form the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, the terms related to the star ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) and the albedo ($A$, which is given as the same for both planets) cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial simplification shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**Step 2b: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) using the formula for a circular orbit:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nA key piece of information is that the planets were detected via the **transit method**, which is only possible if the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$. This justifies the approximation $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**Step 2c: Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the expression for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 2d: Combine Formulas and Substitute Doppler Shift Data**\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ (since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nThis gives the final formula for the calculation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n### **3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$): 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$): 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$): 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$): 0.04 Å\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Consensus on Method:** All candidate answers correctly identified the physical principles and derived the same final formula.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical result to be approximately 0.536.\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are extraneous details not required for the final ratio calculation.\n*   **Importance of Transit Method:** The mention of the transit method is critical as it justifies assuming the orbital inclination is ~90°, which simplifies the RV formula.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to the value `~ 0.53`. In the original question's option list, this corresponds to option B. The confusion in the candidate answers stems from inconsistent lettering of the options, but the numerical result is undisputed.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Goal**\nThe main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, we divide the equation for Planet 1 by the equation for Planet 2. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These common terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ will cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n### **4. Apply Careful Points and Simplifications**\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values for the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio. They are contextual details that cancel out.\n*   **The `sin(i)` Term:** A crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is only possible if the orbits are nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Therefore, we can assume $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the sine terms cancel from the ratio.\n*   **Doppler Shift and RV Amplitude:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ it causes ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K-values is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the ratio of the semi-major axes becomes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### **5. Final Derivation and Calculation**\nSubstitute this result back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leaving the final, simple formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### **6.

The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).

For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n    As noted in the \"Careful Points\" below, the mention of the transit method justifies assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula becomes $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_*^2} \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Calculate:** Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.

This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out in the derivation. They are included to test a complete understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method:** The statement that the planets were detected using *both* transit and RV methods is crucial. The transit method only works if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$). This justifies the key assumption that $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which simplifies the RV formula and makes the problem solvable.\n*   **Doppler Shift vs. RV Amplitude:** It is essential to recognize that the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows the direct use of the ratio of the given Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$) in place of the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$).\n*   **Index Consistency:** Throughout the derivation, it is critical to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent to avoid inverting a ratio by mistake. The final formula correctly combines the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) with the Doppler shift ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculation consistently yields a result of ~0.536.

When we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star (constant $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) with the same albedo (constant $A$), the formula simplifies significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis ($a$) can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$). For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{M_* K^2}$.\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can now find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out.\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Final Formula Derivation:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n    Since the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is identical to $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Plugging in the given values:\n    *   Mass Ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$): $5/7$\n    *   Doppler Shift Ratio ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$): $0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4$\n    *   Inclination Ratio ($\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$): Since both planets are detected by the transit method, we must assume their inclinations are nearly identical and close to 90°, making this ratio equal to 1.\n\n    The final calculation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to solve for the ratio.

The transit detection is crucial because it justifies the assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i_1$ and $i_2$) are both approximately 90°, meaning $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$.

Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n3.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity**: The semi-major axis can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, the formula is $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$. A crucial detail is that the planets were detected via the **transit method**, which implies an orbital inclination ($i$) of approximately 90°, making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: By rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$. We can now find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify**: Substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    The square root cancels the squares, leading to the final working formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the options provided in the prompt:\n    *   A) ~ 0.53\n    *   B) ~ 1.30\n    *   C) ~ 0.98\n    *   D) ~ 1.05\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. This information is not needed to solve for the ratio and is included to test the understanding of which physical quantities cancel out.\n*   **Importance of the Transit Method**: The mention of the transit method is critical. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ (and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), which is necessary to simplify the radial velocity equation.\n*   **Correct Derivation**: The final result depends on a multi-step derivation. An error, such as inverting a ratio (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ instead of $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) or mismanaging the square root, would lead to an incorrect answer. The consistent derivation across all candidate answers confirms the final formula is correct.\n*   **Clerical Errors**: The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and calculation were performed correctly by nearly all agents, several made a simple clerical error by matching the correct numerical result (~0.536) to the wrong letter option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final selection against the original list of options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
