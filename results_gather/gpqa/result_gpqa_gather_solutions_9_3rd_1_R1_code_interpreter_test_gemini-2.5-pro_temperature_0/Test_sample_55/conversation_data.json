Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the physical process as a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThe analysis consistently applies the E1 selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n < 0$ (for decay)\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\nAll answers correctly deduce the properties of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both transitions:\n*   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** Requires $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and $n'<3$.\n*   **Second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Requires $l'=1$ and $n'>1$.\n\nCombining these constraints, all analyses correctly conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. This leaves three possible intermediate states, and thus three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that the routes listed in all options (A, C, and D) are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on the following points:\n*   **Symmetry:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Due to this symmetry, the decay process is isotropic. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe analysis from all agents robustly concludes that any valid transition route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now compare this result with the options given in the original question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and correct probability.**\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented in all the candidate answers, only option D matches the derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key physical property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nAll candidate answers correctly apply this physical reasoning and arrive at a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for any valid path. The discrepancy in their final letter choices is due to inconsistent labeling of the options. We must evaluate the original options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nComparing our calculated result with these options, only option A presents a valid transition route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics:** The problem asks for a specific decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom going from state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade through an intermediate state, $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** I first apply the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, and $\\Delta n < 0$ for decay) to determine the properties of the intermediate state.\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Since $n=3$, we must have $n'<3$.\n    *   **Second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Since the final state has $l_f=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ for the transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$). Since $n_f=1$, we must have $n'>1$.\n    *   **Conclusion on Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$, $l'=1$, and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This means there are three possible, physically allowed decay paths via the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:** The crucial step is to determine the probability of any single path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay process is isotropic. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is exactly $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the $n=2, l=1$ level.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any specific cascade route is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Decide:** All candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules and arrive at the same physical conclusion: the probability for any valid route is $1/3$. The discrepancy between their final answers (A, B, C, D) stems from inconsistencies in how the options were labeled in their respective prompts. I will ignore their final letter choices and focus on the correct physical reasoning. I will then apply this reasoning to the specific set of options provided in *this* prompt.\n\n5.  **Final Check against Provided Options:** I will write a Python script to formalize this decision process. The script will calculate the correct probability and then check which of the given options matches this result.\n\n    *   A) Route: ...$|2,1,0\\rangle$..., Probability: $2/3$ -> Incorrect.\n    *   B) Route: ...$|2,1,-1\\rangle$..., Probability: $1/4$ -> Incorrect.\n    *   C) Route: ...$|2,1,0\\rangle$..., Probability: $1/3$ -> **Correct**.\n    *   D) Route: ...$|2,1,1\\rangle$..., Probability: $1/4$ -> Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that pairs a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$ is C.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef decide_final_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the H-atom decay problem to determine the correct option.\n    \n    The function follows these steps:\n    1.

Analyze the Physical Process and Selection Rules**\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The E1 selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, it must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three corresponding decay routes are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Emission:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Calculating the Probability:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability (or branching ratio) of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The only option that matches this result is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which implies the existence of an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor an E1 transition to be \"allowed,\" the quantum numbers must change according to a specific set of selection rules. All candidate answers correctly identify these rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, corresponding to the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability (or branching ratio) of a specific route. All candidate answers correctly converge on the same reasoning:\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. Physically, this means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). Therefore, the probability is split equally among them.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any *single specific* path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step cascade, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the process goes through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nThe transitions are governed by the E1 selection rules, which dictate which changes in quantum numbers are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotropic Emission.** Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the subsequent decay (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations. This means there can be no preference for the atom to be left in any particular magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the intermediate state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Branching Ratio.** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). The decay must populate them with equal probability. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Probability of the Second Step.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Thus, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n$P_{total} = P_{step\\;1} \\times P_{step\\;2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account all careful points derived from the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Physical Process**\n\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade through an intermediate state. The process can be written as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Careful Point 1: Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nThe first critical step is to apply the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions, which govern which changes in quantum numbers are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Careful Point 2: Determining the Intermediate State**\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The decay rule requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The decay rule requires $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**4. Careful Point 3: Calculating the Transition Probability**\n\nThis is the deciding factor. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The key insight, agreed upon by all successful analyses, is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. An s-orbital ($l=0$) has no angular dependence and thus no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **The Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nWe must now find the option that lists a valid route with this exact probability.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ — **This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay that proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Combining the constraints.** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The role of symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the physical process as a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThere is a unanimous agreement on the E1 selection rules that govern this process:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay, $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to determine the properties of the intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on $n'$ ($1 < n' < 3$), all agents correctly conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, and again, there is a complete consensus on the reasoning.\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no angular dependence and no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) does not favor any particular direction. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because this is the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe unanimous conclusion derived from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that any valid transition route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. The task is now to select the option that matches this conclusion.\n\nLet's examine the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct physical reasoning presented across all candidate answers, only option A is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Apply Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$.

For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are three physically possible intermediate states, and thus three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes presented in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. This means the atom's electron cloud has no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific path** is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correctly calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Physical Process**\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nThe rules that govern which transitions are allowed for an E1 process are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. To satisfy $\\Delta n < 0$, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (which we know has $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the selection rules.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. To satisfy $\\Delta n < 0$, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states, corresponding to the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The question asks for the probability of one specific route out of the three possibilities.\n\n*   **The Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. The state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, there can be no preference for the atom to transition into one of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The three possible decay paths for the first step are therefore **equally probable**. Since these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, their probabilities must sum to 1. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because once the atom is in the 2p state, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the 1s ground state. The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5.

The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible, physically allowed, intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are all physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means its wavefunction has no angular dependence, and there is no preferred direction in space. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states. In this case, the three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate and differ only in their spatial orientation. Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$. Let's examine the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe core of the question is to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the selection rules for E1 transitions, which are the fundamental constraints on the process:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($n$):** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nA consensus is reached among all candidate answers by applying the selection rules to both steps of the decay:\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$).\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is calculating the probability of one specific route. All candidate answers converge on the same correct reasoning:\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) does not favor any particular direction. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, and all candidate answers arrive at the same correct physical reasoning.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotropic Decay.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the physical process as a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThe analysis consistently applies the E1 selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n < 0$ (for decay)\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\nAll answers correctly deduce the properties of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both transitions:\n*   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** Requires $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and $n'<3$.\n*   **Second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Requires $l'=1$ and $n'>1$.\n\nCombining these constraints, all analyses correctly conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. This leaves three possible intermediate states, and thus three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThis confirms that the routes listed in all options (A, C, and D) are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on the following points:\n*   **Symmetry:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Due to this symmetry, the decay process is isotropic. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe analysis from all agents robustly concludes that any valid transition route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now compare this result with the options given in the original question:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and correct probability.**\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct physical reasoning presented in all the candidate answers, only option D matches the derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Intermediate State\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Transition Probability\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key physical property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nAll candidate answers correctly apply this physical reasoning and arrive at a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for any valid path. The discrepancy in their final letter choices is due to inconsistent labeling of the options. We must evaluate the original options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nComparing our calculated result with these options, only option A presents a valid transition route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics:** The problem asks for a specific decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom going from state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade through an intermediate state, $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** I first apply the E1 selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, and $\\Delta n < 0$ for decay) to determine the properties of the intermediate state.\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Since $n=3$, we must have $n'<3$.\n    *   **Second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Since the final state has $l_f=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ for the transition to be allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$). Since $n_f=1$, we must have $n'>1$.\n    *   **Conclusion on Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$, $l'=1$, and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This means there are three possible, physically allowed decay paths via the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:** The crucial step is to determine the probability of any single path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the decay process is isotropic. The atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for any single path is exactly $1/3$.\n    *   The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel from the $n=2, l=1$ level.\n    *   Therefore, the total probability for any specific cascade route is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Decide:** All candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules and arrive at the same physical conclusion: the probability for any valid route is $1/3$. The discrepancy between their final answers (A, B, C, D) stems from inconsistencies in how the options were labeled in their respective prompts. I will ignore their final letter choices and focus on the correct physical reasoning. I will then apply this reasoning to the specific set of options provided in *this* prompt.\n\n5.  **Final Check against Provided Options:** I will write a Python script to formalize this decision process.

Analyze the Physical Process and Selection Rules**\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The E1 selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions in the cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, it must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All three corresponding decay routes are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Emission:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Calculating the Probability:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability (or branching ratio) of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The only option that matches this result is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom in the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ decaying to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step process, also known as a cascade decay. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition, which implies the existence of an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor an E1 transition to be \"allowed,\" the quantum numbers must change according to a specific set of selection rules. All candidate answers correctly identify these rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, corresponding to the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability (or branching ratio) of a specific route. All candidate answers correctly converge on the same reasoning:\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. S-states are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. Physically, this means the atom in this state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). Therefore, the probability is split equally among them.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability of the atom taking any *single specific* path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via a two-step cascade, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. This implies the process goes through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nThe transitions are governed by the E1 selection rules, which dictate which changes in quantum numbers are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps to find the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The possible intermediate states are the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotropic Emission.** Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the subsequent decay (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic when averaged over all photon directions and polarizations. This means there can be no preference for the atom to be left in any particular magnetic sublevel ($m'$) of the intermediate state.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Branching Ratio.** The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields). The decay must populate them with equal probability. Since these are the only three allowed outcomes for the first step, their probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Probability of the Second Step.** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Thus, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n$P_{total} = P_{step\\;1} \\times P_{step\\;2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account all careful points derived from the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Physical Process**\n\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade through an intermediate state. The process can be written as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Careful Point 1: Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nThe first critical step is to apply the strict quantum mechanical selection rules for E1 transitions, which govern which changes in quantum numbers are allowed:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Careful Point 2: Determining the Intermediate State**\n\nWe must apply the selection rules to both steps to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The decay rule requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The decay rule requires $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**4. Careful Point 3: Calculating the Transition Probability**\n\nThis is the deciding factor. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The key insight, agreed upon by all successful analyses, is the **spherical symmetry** of the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$. An s-orbital ($l=0$) has no angular dependence and thus no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **The Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nWe must now find the option that lists a valid route with this exact probability.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ — Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ — **This option presents a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ — Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay that proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nEach step must obey the E1 selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   For decay, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determining the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions to find the quantum numbers of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Combining the constraints.** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are exactly three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the probability of one specific decay route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Since this is the only available channel, the probability of this transition is 1.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The role of symmetry.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric; their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay process (spontaneous emission) must be isotropic, meaning it is equally likely to proceed into any of the available, degenerate final states.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), and these are the only allowed channels, the total probability of 1 is divided equally among them. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is therefore exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route for this process has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the physical process as a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThere is a unanimous agreement on the E1 selection rules that govern this process:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay, $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to determine the properties of the intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on $n'$ ($1 < n' < 3$), all agents correctly conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, and again, there is a complete consensus on the reasoning.\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wavefunction is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no angular dependence and no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) does not favor any particular direction. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$), which differ only in their spatial orientation.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the $n=2$ shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because this is the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nThe unanimous conclusion derived from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that any valid transition route has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. The task is now to select the option that matches this conclusion.\n\nLet's examine the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct physical reasoning presented across all candidate answers, only option A is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Apply Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$.

For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are three physically possible intermediate states, and thus three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes presented in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. This means the atom's electron cloud has no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes for this first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any **single specific path** is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). Since this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correctly calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Physical Process**\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\nThe rules that govern which transitions are allowed for an E1 process are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to find the properties of the intermediate state.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. To satisfy $\\Delta n < 0$, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state (which we know has $l'=1$), the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the selection rules.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. To satisfy $\\Delta n < 0$, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states, corresponding to the three degenerate states of the 2p subshell: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The question asks for the probability of one specific route out of the three possibilities.\n\n*   **The Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. The state has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. Consequently, there can be no preference for the atom to transition into one of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The three possible decay paths for the first step are therefore **equally probable**. Since these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, their probabilities must sum to 1. The probability of transitioning to any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, because once the atom is in the 2p state, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the 1s ground state. The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, any valid route must have a probability of 1/3.

The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is a valid change.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining the constraints:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible, physically allowed, intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are all physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a specific route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means its wavefunction has no angular dependence, and there is no preferred direction in space. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission of the photon is isotropic (equal in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states. In this case, the three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate and differ only in their spatial orientation. Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of the atom taking any single one of these paths is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower principal quantum number is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of $1/3$. Let's examine the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The route is valid (ignoring the typo), but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe core of the question is to identify the correct decay path and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the selection rules for E1 transitions, which are the fundamental constraints on the process:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($n$):** For a decay (photon emission), energy must be lost, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nA consensus is reached among all candidate answers by applying the selection rules to both steps of the decay:\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (to satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$, so the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ (to satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. This is consistent with the intermediate state having $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$).\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe crucial part of the problem is calculating the probability of one specific route. All candidate answers converge on the same correct reasoning:\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) does not favor any particular direction. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, and these are the only allowed E1 channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. We must now select the option from the original prompt that matches this result.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ --- Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ --- **Correct route and correct probability.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This is a cascade decay process that proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThe E1 selection rules that govern these transitions are:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2.

Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, and all candidate answers arrive at the same correct physical reasoning.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry of the Initial State.** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. A key property of s-states is that they are spherically symmetric, meaning their wavefunctions have no angular dependence. They have no preferred orientation in space.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Isotropic Decay.** Because the initial state is isotropic, the decay process (spontaneous emission) cannot favor one direction over another. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available degenerate final states. In this case, the three intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and differ only in their spatial orientation (related to $m'$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Branching Ratio.** Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, and these are the only allowed channels to the n=2 shell, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any *single specific* path is exactly $1/3$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Total Probability.** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1. This is because, from the 2p level, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the 1s ground state. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4.

Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, meaning it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in principal quantum number:** For decay (photon emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2.

We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$.

Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state.
