Define the System and States**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\n\n**2.

Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate their energies.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E1 = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E2 = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n\n    There are **2 states** with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   **States with two spins up (+1) and one spin down (-1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **States with two spins down (-1) and one spin up (+1):**\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) ] = -J [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J [ (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    There are a total of 3 + 3 = **6 states** with energy **E = J**.\n\n**4. Construct the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from all states. We can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies (the number of states with that energy).\n\n*   Energy E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we will list all 8 possible spin configurations and calculate the energy for each one:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all having an energy of E = J.\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all also having an energy of E = J.\n\n4.  **All spins down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNext, we group the states by their energy levels and count the number of states (degeneracy) for each energy level:\n\n*   **Energy E = -3J:** This energy level occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n*   **Energy E = J:** This energy level occurs for the remaining six states. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be calculated by summing over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-β(-3J)) + g₂ * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the System**: The system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2x2x2 = 8 possible configurations (states).\n2.  **Energy Calculation**: The energy for each state is given by the formula `E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)`.\n3.  **Partition Function**: The partition function `Z` is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states.\n4.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Iterate through all 8 possible states of the three spins.\n    *   For each state, calculate its energy `E`.\n    *   Group the states by their energy level and count how many states (degeneracy) correspond to each energy level.\n    *   Construct the final expression for the partition function `Z` by summing the terms `(degeneracy) * exp(-βE)` for each unique energy level.\n    *   Compare the derived expression with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the partition function for a system of three spins.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Possible values for each spin\n    spins = [1, -1]\n    \n    # Store the energy values for all possible states\n    energy_levels = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 2*2*2 = 8 states\n    for s1 in spins:\n        for s2 in spins:\n            for s3 in spins:\n                # The energy is E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n                # We calculate the coefficient of -J\n                energy_coefficient = s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3\n                energy_levels.append(energy_coefficient)\n                \n    # Count the number of states (degeneracy) for each energy level\n    # The result will be a dictionary like {energy_coefficient: count}\n    # For example, {3: 2, -1: 6} means:\n    # - 2 states have energy E = -J * 3 = -3J\n    # - 6 states have energy E = -J * (-1) = J\n    degeneracy = collections.Counter(energy_levels)\n    \n    # Build the partition function string Z = sum(degeneracy * exp(-beta * E))\n    terms = []\n    for energy_coeff, count in sorted(degeneracy.items(), reverse=True):\n        # E = -J * energy_coeff\n        # exp(-beta*E) = exp(-beta*(-J*energy_coeff)) = exp(J*beta*energy_coeff)\n        if energy_coeff == 1:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^(-J\\\\beta)\"\n        elif energy_coeff == -1:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^(J\\\\beta)\"\n        else:\n            term_str = f\"{count}e^({energy_coeff}J\\\\beta)\"\n        terms.append(term_str)\n        \n    partition_function_str = \" + \".join(terms)\n    \n    # The options provided\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Z= 2e^(3J\\\\beta)+6e^(-J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"B\": \"Z= 2e^(2J\\\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"C\": \"Z= 6e^(2J\\\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\\\beta)\",\n        \"D\": \"Z= 2e^(-3J\\\\beta)+6e^(J\\\\beta)\"\n    }\n    \n    # Find the correct option\n    correct_option = None\n    # A simplified representation for comparison\n    derived_simple_str = \"Z= \" + \" + \".join(sorted(terms))\n    \n    for option, value in options.items():\n        # Also sort the terms in the option for robust comparison\n        parts = value.replace(\"Z= \", \"\").split('+')\n        option_simple_str = \"Z= \" + \" + \".join(sorted(parts))\n        if derived_simple_str == option_simple_str:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n            \n    print(\"The possible states and their corresponding energy coefficients (E / -J) are:\")\n    print(f\"Energy coefficients: {energy_levels}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe degeneracy of each energy level is:\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy: {dict(degeneracy)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means there are:\")\n    print(f\"- {degeneracy[3]} states with energy E = -3J\")\n    print(f\"- {degeneracy[-1]} states with energy E = J\")\n    print(\"\\nThe partition function Z is the sum of Boltzmann factors for all states:\")\n    print(f\"Z = {degeneracy[3]} * exp(-β*(-3J)) + {degeneracy[-1]} * exp(-β*J)\")\n    print(f\"Z = {partition_function_str}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{option}) {value}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is: {correct_option}\")\n\nsolve_partition_function()\n<<<A>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 83\n    <<<A>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates:\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy (degeneracy) and sum them up:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n    where g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's list all 8 states, calculate the term [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and then find the energy E for each state.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum = [S1S2+S1S3+S2S3] | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):**\n    *   E1 = -3J\n    *   The states with this energy are State 1 (+1, +1, +1) and State 8 (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):**\n    *   E2 = +J\n    *   The states with this energy are States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the number of states for each energy level. It's crucial to list all 8 states or use combinatorics (e.g., \"all spins up/down\" vs. \"one spin flipped\") to correctly determine the degeneracies. Here, the total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possibilities.\n\n**6. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\n*   Contribution from E1: g1 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E2: g2 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-β(+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7.

The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the System and States**\n\nThe system has three components (spins), and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8. We need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each.\n\nA state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy for Each State**\n\nThe energy depends on the sum of the products of the spins: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's calculate this sum for all 8 possible states.\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(1)+(1)(1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(-1)+(-1)(1)+(-1)(1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n**3. Grouping States by Energy (Degeneracy)**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy E1 = -3J:** This energy level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned, either all up or all down. The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 2.\n*   **Energy E2 = J:** This energy level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n(Check: Total states = g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.)\n\n**4. Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all states. We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = Σ_levels (degeneracy) * e^(-β * Energy)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible states of the system.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to find the canonical partition function, Z, for a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3). The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identify the Microstates and Calculate Their Energies**\nThe system has three spins, and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. We need to calculate the energy E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] for each state.\n\nWe can group the states by their configuration to simplify the calculation:\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This applies to two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   For state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   For state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   Conclusion: There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This applies to the remaining six states. Let's check one example, (+1, +1, -1):\n    *   For state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the energy function, all 6 states of this type will have the same energy. These states are:\n        (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   Conclusion: There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.\n\n**3.

There are 2 states where all spins are aligned and 6 states where one spin is flipped.\n*   **Energy Sign:** The energy for the aligned states is negative (E = -3J), while the energy for the flipped states is positive (E = J).\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Exponent:** The exponent is `-βE`. A common mistake is to get the sign wrong. For E = -3J, the term is e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ). For E = J, the term is e^(-β(J)) = e^(-Jβ).\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided answers shows that while all of them correctly calculate the two energy levels (-3J and J) and their degeneracies (2 and 6), several fail in the final step of matching their result to the correctly labeled option.

Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\n*   The canonical partition function (Z) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates:\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT).\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy (degeneracy) and sum them up:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n    where g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's list all 8 states, calculate the term [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and then find the energy E for each state.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum = [S1S2+S1S3+S2S3] | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n|   1   | +1 | +1 | +1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n|   2   | +1 | +1 | -1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   3   | +1 | -1 | +1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   4   | -1 | +1 | +1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   5   | +1 | -1 | -1 |  -1  |  -1  |  +1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   6   | -1 | +1 | -1 |  -1  |  +1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   7   | -1 | -1 | +1 |  +1  |  -1  |  -1  |           -1           |          +J          |\n|   8   | -1 | -1 | -1 |  +1  |  +1  |  +1  |           +3           |         -3J          |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):**\n    *   E1 = -3J\n    *   The states with this energy are State 1 (+1, +1, +1) and State 8 (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):**\n    *   E2 = +J\n    *   The states with this energy are States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the number of states for each energy level. It's crucial to list all 8 states or use combinatorics (e.g., \"all spins up/down\" vs. \"one spin flipped\") to correctly determine the degeneracies. Here, the total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which confirms we have accounted for all possibilities.\n\n**6. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = Σ g_i * e^(-βE_i).\n\n*   Contribution from E1: g1 * e^(-βE1) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   Contribution from E2: g2 * e^(-βE2) = 6 * e^(-β(+J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7.

Understanding the System and States**\n\nThe system has three components (spins), and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8. We need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each.\n\nA state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy for Each State**\n\nThe energy depends on the sum of the products of the spins: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's calculate this sum for all 8 possible states.\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    Energy E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1-1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(1) = -1+1-1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (-1)(1)+(-1)(1)+(1)(1) = -1-1+1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down** (3 possibilities)\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 = (1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = -1-1+1 = -1.

Grouping States by Energy (Degeneracy)**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy E1 = -3J:** This energy level corresponds to the two states where all spins are aligned, either all up or all down. The degeneracy (number of states) is g1 = 2.\n*   **Energy E2 = J:** This energy level corresponds to the six states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n(Check: Total states = g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This is correct.)\n\n**4. Calculating the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all states. We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = Σ_levels (degeneracy) * e^(-β * Energy)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**5.

The contribution of these two states to the partition function is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis case includes configurations where two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1), or one spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).\n*   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are six states with an energy of J. The contribution of these six states to the partition function is 6 * e^(-βJ) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n**Total Partition Function (Z):**\nTo get the total partition function, we sum the contributions from all the states:\n\nZ = (Contribution from E = -3J) + (Contribution from E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Here, β = 1/(kT), and the energy E is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nSince each of the three spins can take a value of +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system. We will calculate the energy for each of these states.\n\nThe states can be grouped by the number of spins pointing up (+1) and down (-1).\n\n**Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n*   **State 1:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E1 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E2 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states with an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are +1 and one spin is -1.**\n*   **State 3:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E3 = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 4:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E4 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 5:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E5 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\n**Case 3: One spin is +1 and two spins are -1.**\n*   **State 6:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E6 = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 7:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n    E7 = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 8:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n    E8 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are 3 states with an energy of J.\n\nIn summary, we have two distinct energy levels:\n1.  Energy E_1 = -3J, with a degeneracy (number of states) g_1 = 2.\n2.  Energy E_2 = J, with a degeneracy g_2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g_1 * e^(-βE_1) + g_2 * e^(-βE_2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
