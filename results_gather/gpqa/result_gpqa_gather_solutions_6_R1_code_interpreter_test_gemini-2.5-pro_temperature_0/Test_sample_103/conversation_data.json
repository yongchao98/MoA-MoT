The magnitude of the periodic wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. The maximum shift, Δλ_max, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   **Given Data:** Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom and Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit where the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the star's velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution to be possible, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`i₁ ≈ i₂`). With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can express the proportionality as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To find this, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble implies the planet is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period (P₂ < P₁). Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Key Proportionalities:** The solution depends entirely on correctly identifying the two relationships: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. An error in the exponent of the second relationship is a common mistake.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to solve for the correct ratio (`P₂ / P₁`) and to handle the exponents correctly. The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that in the absence of other information, the orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems. This allows the `m_p * sin(i)` term to be treated as a constant.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers, despite sometimes choosing different final letters, correctly calculate the numerical value to be approximately 0.36. The discrepancy in the final letter choice highlights the importance of matching the calculated value to the specific option list provided in the original question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the consensus derivation from the provided answers. All candidate answers agree on the underlying physics and the calculation steps, even though they disagree on the final letter choice due to scrambled options. I will walk through this consensus derivation, perform the calculation, and then match the result to the specific options provided in the original question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for K is `K ∝ (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`. Given that the star masses (`M_star`) and planet masses (`m_p`) are the same, and assuming the orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar, the relationship simplifies to an inverse proportionality between K and the cube root of the period P.\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n3.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):** We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To find the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the known ratio of the wavelength shifts into the equation.

A faster stellar wobble is typically caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1.

The magnitude of the periodic wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. The maximum shift, Δλ_max, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   **Given Data:** Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom and Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio:** The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit where the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the star's velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution to be possible, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`i₁ ≈ i₂`). With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can express the proportionality as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio `P₂ / P₁`.

For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble implies the planet is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period (P₂ < P₁). Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Key Proportionalities:** The solution depends entirely on correctly identifying the two relationships: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. An error in the exponent of the second relationship is a common mistake.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to solve for the correct ratio (`P₂ / P₁`) and to handle the exponents correctly. The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities: `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that in the absence of other information, the orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems. This allows the `m_p * sin(i)` term to be treated as a constant.\n*   **Consistency of Calculation:** All 15 candidate answers, despite sometimes choosing different final letters, correctly calculate the numerical value to be approximately 0.36.

For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble implies the planet is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period (P₂ < P₁). Therefore, the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options A, B, and D, making C the only plausible answer.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The most critical part of the physics is understanding that the velocity amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period `P`, i.e., `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to handle the exponents and ratios correctly. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`. Accidentally inverting the ratio to `(K₂ / K₁)^3` would lead to an incorrect answer greater than 1.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that the unstated orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems.\n*   **Option Matching:** The candidate answers show that while the calculation is straightforward, confusion can arise from scrambled option lists.

The magnitude of this wavelength shift, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, which is denoted as K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom and Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio of Amplitudes:** From the direct proportionality, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `mₚ` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution to be possible, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`i₁ ≈ i₂`). With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   **Simplified Relationship:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now set up an equation for the two systems using the relationships derived above:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To find this, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the length of the orbital period of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs. 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which is caused by a closer orbit. A closer orbit corresponds to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` to be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition, immediately ruling out options A and C.\n*   **Key Proportionalities:** The solution depends entirely on correctly identifying that `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** It is crucial to handle the exponents correctly. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`. A common mistake would be to invert the ratio or forget to cube it.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard and necessary assumption that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are similar for both systems, as the RV method can only measure the minimum mass, `mₚ * sin(i)`.\n\nComparing the calculated value of ~0.36 to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the physics of the problem, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects the Doppler shift in a star's light.
