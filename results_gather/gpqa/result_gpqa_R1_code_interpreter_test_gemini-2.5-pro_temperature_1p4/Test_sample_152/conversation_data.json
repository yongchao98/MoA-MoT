    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### **Reaction A Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n*   **Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻. This is a \"soft\" nucleophile, ideal for Michael additions.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The β-carbon (the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the ester group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    2.  The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and subsequently, the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming an intermediate enolate.\n    3.  This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final adduct, product (A).\n*   **Product (A) Structure:**\n    The bond forms between the central carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    Donor: **C**H(COOCH₃)₂\n    Acceptor: p-tolyl-**C**H(β)-CH(α)-COOCH₃\n    Product (A): (CH₃OOC)₂CH — CH(p-tolyl) — CH₂ — COOCH₃\n*   **Naming Product (A):** The structure is a propane chain substituted with three methyl carboxylate (ester) groups and a p-tolyl group. For IUPAC naming, we identify the main propane chain (C1-C2-C3) such that the principal functional groups get the lowest possible locants.\n    Let's number the chain as follows:\n    (CH₃OOC)₂CH(1) — CH(2)(p-tolyl) — CH₂(3)COOCH₃\n    The substituents are: two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, one p-tolyl group at C2, and one methoxycarbonyl group at C3.\n    The name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n*   **Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which utilizes an enamine as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The carbon atom β to the nitrogen (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic, analogous to the α-carbon of an enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion (from the enamine part) and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion (from the acceptor part).\n    2.  The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    3.  The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product (B) Structure:**\n    The reaction results in a cyclohexanone ring with a new substituent at the α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    The final product (B) is 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Naming Product (B):** Let's consider the options provided. The name \"3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\" treats the 4-carbon nitrile chain as the parent.\n    Parent chain: butanenitrile (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CN).\n    Let's number it: CH₃(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1).\n    A (2-oxocyclohexyl) group is attached to C3.\n    This corresponds to the structure: (2-oxocyclohexyl)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN. This matches the structure we derived. The other option, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, is the enol tautomer. The keto form is generally the major, more stable product after acidic workup.\n    Thus, product (B) is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction:** C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Type:** This is a retrosynthesis problem based on a Michael addition. We need to identify the starting material C.\n*   **Known Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    -   The main structure is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    -   The substituent at C2 is a 3-oxobutyl group: -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Known Reactant:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃. This is the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    -   The acceptor (MVK) becomes the -CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃ part of the 3-oxobutyl side chain.\n    -   This side chain is attached to the C2 position of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring in the product.\n    -   Therefore, the C-C bond was formed between C2 of reactant C and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    -   This implies that the Michael donor was the enolate of reactant C, and the nucleophilic carbon was C2.\n*   **Identifying Reactant C:** The C2 carbon of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is highly acidic (it's an \"active methylene\" group) and readily forms an enolate with a base like KOH. Therefore, the starting material (C) that provides this nucleophilic C2 must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Correct C\n*   B) Correct A, Correct B, Incorrect C\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B, Correct C\n*   D) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Incorrect C\n\nOption (C) correctly identifies all reactants and products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
