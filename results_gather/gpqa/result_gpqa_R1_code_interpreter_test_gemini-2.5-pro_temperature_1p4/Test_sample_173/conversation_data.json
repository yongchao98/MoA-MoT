    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step calculation, first using relativistic principles and then classical ones, to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Finally, we will compute the difference between these two values.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`. This means `m1` is the \"more massive fragment\".\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fission releases energy, which becomes the kinetic energy of the two fragments, `T1` and `T2`.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. this Q-value is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nWe can establish a ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2/m1 = 1/2`.\nSo, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics (The Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nAlso, total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum, the momentum magnitudes are equal (`p1 = p2`), so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = E1_rest = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = E2_rest = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`.\n\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nCancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1_rel`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can run a short python script.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV unless specified otherwise.\n\n# 1. Initial State\nE_initial_rest = 300\n\n# 2. Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# m1 = 0.66*M and m2 = 0.33*M\nE1_rest = 0.66 * E_initial_rest\nE2_rest = 0.33 * E_initial_rest\n\n# 3. Q-value\nQ = E_initial_rest - (E1_rest + E2_rest)\n\n# 4. Classical T1\n# T1 + T2 = Q and T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2 => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# 5. Relativistic T1\n# As derived from momentum conservation: T1 * (2*E_initial_rest) = Q * (Q + 2*E2_rest)\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * E2_rest)) / (2 * E_initial_rest)\n\n# 6.

    "Here is a summary of the solution steps:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: A nucleus with rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV` is at rest.\n2.  **Final State**: The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n3.  **Fragment Rest Masses**: Solving the equations gives:\n    *   `m2 = 0.33 * M` => Rest energy `E2_rest = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1 = 0.66 * M` => Rest energy `E1_rest = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n4.  **Energy Released (Q-value)**: The energy converted to kinetic energy is the loss in rest mass.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial_rest - (E1_rest + E2_rest)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n5.  **Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)**:\n    *   From conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   Using `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, we get `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n6.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_rel)**:\n    *   Relativistic momentum is given by `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`) means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*E1_rest = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2_rest`\n    *   Substituting `T2 = 3 - T1`, `E1_rest = 198 GeV`, and `E2_rest = 99 GeV`, we solve the equation:\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1`\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV`.\n7.  **Difference**:\n    *   The difference is `T1_rel - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference matches the output from the code.\n\n<<<A>>>"
