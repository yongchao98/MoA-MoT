    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation that proceeds via *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   Applying *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   The starting alkene and the reagent (mCPBA) are both achiral. The epoxidation creates two new stereocenters (at C4 and C5). Since the product, the *trans*-epoxide, is chiral (it lacks a plane of symmetry), a racemic mixture must be formed.\n    *   The products are an equal mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This causes the ring to open via an *anti*-addition mechanism (the nucleophile, H₂O, attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen). The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of each enantiomer from the racemic mixture:\n        *   **(4R,5R)-epoxide:** The nucleophilic attack of water at either C4 or C5 results in the inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. Attack at C5 inverts the configuration from R to S, while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **(4S,5S)-epoxide:** Similarly, attack at C5 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C4 remains S. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The molecules (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction starts with (E)-oct-4-ene and results in a single product: the *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition epoxidation.\n    *   Applying *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   The *cis*-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (which is identical to 4S,5R).\n3.  **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** This is an *anti*-addition ring-opening.\n    *   We start with the achiral *meso*-epoxide. The two carbons of the epoxide ring (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic. Attack by water can occur at either carbon with equal probability.\n        *   **Attack at C4:** The configuration at C4 is inverted (from R to S), while C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **Attack at C5:** The configuration at C5 is inverted (from S to R), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the attacks are equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed. (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene and results in a racemic mixture of two products: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three stereoisomers is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties (like polarity, size, boiling point) in an achiral environment. They will elute at the same time.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The standard HPLC will show a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Since the mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers, the chiral column will resolve all of them.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound)\n    *   The chiral HPLC will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
