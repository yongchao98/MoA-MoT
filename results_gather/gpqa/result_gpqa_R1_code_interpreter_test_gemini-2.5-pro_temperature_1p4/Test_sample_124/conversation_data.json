    "This problem requires finding the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n### 1. Finding the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved most easily by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian is separable:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where each $H_i$ is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the i-th dimension.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nNow, we can identify the energy states:\n*   **Ground State (lowest energy state):** This corresponds to $N=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 2. Finding the Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. In other words, we need to find the number of ways to write $N$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n\nFor the third excited state, $N=3$. We need to find the number of integer solutions to:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z \\geq 0$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of solutions (degeneracy $g_N$) is given by the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+k-1)!}{N!(k-1)!} = \\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$\nHere, $N=3$ and the number of dimensions $k=3$.\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nTo be explicit, let's list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states\n2.  One is 2, one is 1: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states\n3.  All are 1: (1,1,1) -> 1 state\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option B. I can verify this calculation with a short Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the principal quantum number for the third excited state\n# N=0 is ground state, N=1 is first excited, N=2 is second, N=3 is third.\nN = 3\n\n# Calculate the energy. The energy is E = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# We will calculate the numerical factor (N + 3/2).\nenergy_factor_numerator = 2 * N + 3\nenergy_factor_denominator = 2\nenergy_expression = f\"({energy_factor_numerator}/{energy_factor_denominator}) hbar omega\"\n\n# Calculate the degeneracy.\n# This is the number of ways to write N as a sum of 3 non-negative integers (nx, ny, nz).\n# The formula is g = (N+1)(N+2)/2.\ndegeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n\nprint(f\"Energy of the third excited state (N=3): {energy_expression}\")\nprint(f\"Degeneracy of the third excited state (N=3): {degeneracy}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnergy of the third excited state (N=3): (9/2) hbar omega\nDegeneracy of the third excited state (N=3): 10\n\nThe code confirms that for the third excited state ($N=3$), the energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, this becomes $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian for this system is separable into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i=x,y,z$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where the quantum numbers $n_i$ can be any non-negative integer ($n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nNow we identify the energy states:\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $N=0$ (i.e., $n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$).\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of distinct combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to the same principal quantum number $N$. For the third excited state, we have $N=3$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of combinations (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_N$ for an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state ($N=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nSo, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
