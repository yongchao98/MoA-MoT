    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 C total - 6 C in the ring = 2 C in substituents).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl (C=O) is most commonly an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone:**\n    *   The molecule has two types of protons: aromatic protons (on the benzene ring) and aliphatic protons (on the methyl group).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon. There are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, so these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, so it will shift this signal downfield to the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**. So we expect a signal like: `~2.3 ppm (3H, s)`.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4-),** the molecule is highly symmetrical. We would see two distinct signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal would be a **doublet (d)**. This gives a characteristic `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern.\n        *   If the substitution were ortho or meta, the spectrum would be more complex, likely with 4 separate signals.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too far upfield for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). For this structure, the aldehyde proton (CHO) should be a triplet (split by the CH₂) and the methylene protons (CH₂) should be a doublet (split by the CHO). This option lists them as singlets, which is incorrect splitting.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` signals are a perfect match for a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The `2.3 (3H, s)` signal is a perfect match for the methyl group of an **acetyl (-COCH₃) substituent**.\n        *   This data set perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data is inconsistent. A `(1H, s)` signal at 6.9 ppm would suggest a tri- or tetra-substituted ring, not di-substituted. The other signals do not match the expected structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula and functional groups derived from the question point to a haloacetophenone. The NMR data in option C provides a perfect match for the structure of 4-haloacetophenone (a para-substituted haloacetophenone), which fulfills all the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
