    "An optically active compound must be chiral and must be present in a form that is not a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be achiral are the presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes absolute configuration descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a specific stereoisomer is being described. For such a complex molecule, unless it is a meso compound (which is highly unlikely given the lack of symmetry in the name and structure), specifying a single stereoisomer means we have a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). We need to determine if the (2R,3S) stereoisomer is chiral or a meso compound.\n    Let's draw a conformation of the molecule. In the anti-periplanar conformation (staggered, with COOH groups opposite), there is a center of inversion halfway along the C2-C3 bond. The C2(R) configuration is opposite to the C3(S) configuration, the methyl on C2 is opposite to the methyl on C3, and the H on C2 is opposite to the H on C3. The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. This is a **meso compound**, and it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have any internal symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry). The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R). Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center. Its four different substituents are -H, -OH, the ring path towards the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the ring path away from the double bond (`-CH2-CH2-`). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of a cyclohexane ring. There are two possible stereoisomers: one where all -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where two are on one side and one is on the other (cis-trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bonds. It is **achiral**.\n    *   The cis-trans isomer (e.g., OHs at C1 and C3 are up, OH at C5 is down) possesses a single plane of symmetry that passes through the C5-OH bond and the C2-H bonds. This is a **meso compound** and is **achiral**.\n    Since all possible stereoisomers are achiral, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The IUPAC name specifies a ketone where a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutanoyl group are attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The four groups attached to C3 are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -CH3 (the terminal methyl group of the butane chain, C4)\n    3.  -CH3 (the substituent methyl group)\n    4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    Since two of the groups attached to C3 are identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive. (Note: Even if the intended molecule was chiral, e.g., 1-cyclopentyl-2-methylbutan-1-one, the name does not specify a single enantiomer, so it would be a racemic mixture, which is also optically inactive.)\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive (achiral)\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso/achiral)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active** (chiral, single enantiomer specified)\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
