    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n*   The proton NMR spectrum shows two signals:\n    1.  A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (3 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This corresponds to a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂- group. The 6H integration suggests two equivalent -CH₂-CH₃ groups.\n    2.  A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (4 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to a -CH₂- group next to a -CH₃ group. The 4H integration suggests two equivalent -CH₂-CH₃ groups.\n*   These two signals are characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). However, the description is slightly simplified. Let's consider the possible alkanes. The molecule that best fits the subsequent reactions is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   For n-butane, there are two types of protons: the -CH₃ protons (a) and the -CH₂- protons (b), i.e., (a)H₃C-(b)H₂C-(b)H₂C-(a)H₃C.\n    *   The two -CH₃ groups are equivalent (6H). They are adjacent to a -CH₂- group, so they appear as a triplet.\n    *   The two -CH₂- groups are equivalent (4H). They are adjacent to both a -CH₃- group (3H) and another -CH₂- group (2H). Technically, this should result in a complex multiplet. However, in many contexts, this is simplified or may appear as a pseudo-quartet. Given the reaction sequence that follows, **n-butane** is the most plausible structure for compound A.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds B and C**\n*   **A → B (Monobromination):** Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation. Bromine is selective and will preferentially substitute a hydrogen at the most substituted carbon. In n-butane, the secondary carbons (C2, C3) are more substituted than the primary carbons (C1, C4).\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃ + Br₂/hν → CH₃CH₂CH(Br)CH₃ (major product)\n    *   Therefore, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane**.\n*   **B → C (Elimination):** Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a classic E2 elimination reaction to form an alkene. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH(Br)CH₃ + KOH(alc) → CH₃CH=CHCH₃ (but-2-ene) + CH₃CH₂CH=CH₂ (but-1-ene)\n    *   The major product is but-2-ene. The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers, which confirms that C is **but-2-ene** (it exists as *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene).\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form D**\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   **Dienophile:** The *cis*-isomer of C, which is **cis-but-2-ene**.\n    *   **Diene:** **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**. Although this is an enol (CH(OH)=CH-CH=CH-CH₃), we proceed with the reaction as described. The stereochemistry (E,E) indicates that both double bonds are in the *trans* configuration. The diene provides a 4-carbon backbone for the cycloaddition, with an -OH group on one end (C1 of the diene) and a -CH₃ group on the other end (C4 of the diene).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Stereochemistry of the Product D**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. We need to determine the relative stereochemistry of the four substituents on the ring: an -OH group, and three -CH₃ groups.\n*   The product is named `...-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol`.\n    *   The `OH` is at C1. The methyl groups are at C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   The `OH` at C1 and the `CH₃` at C6 come from the diene.\n    *   The `CH₃` groups at C4 and C5 come from the *cis*-but-2-ene dienophile.\n*   **Stereochemical Rules:**\n    1.  **Dienophile stereochemistry is retained:** Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups at C4 and C5 of the product must be *cis* to each other.\n    2.  **Diene stereochemistry determines ring substitution:** The (E,E) geometry of the diene means its terminal substituents (-OH and -CH₃) will be *trans* to each other in the product (i.e., the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C6 are *trans*).\n    3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction can proceed via two pathways, endo or exo. The endo product is usually kinetically favored, while the exo product is thermodynamically more stable. We must determine the stereochemistry for both possibilities and compare them to the given options.\n\n*   **Case 1: Endo Product**\n    *   The dienophile's substituents (-CH₃ groups) are oriented *trans* to the diene's outer substituents (-OH and -CH₃).\n    *   Relative stereochemistry: C1-OH is *trans* to C6-CH₃. C4-CH₃ and C5-CH₃ are *cis* to each other. The {C4-Me, C5-Me} pair is *trans* to C1-OH.\n    *   Let's assign this relative geometry (e.g., C1-OH up; C6-Me down; C4-Me down; C5-Me down) and determine the absolute configurations (R/S). This leads to the enantiomeric pair (1R, 4R, 5S, 6S) / (1S, 4S, 5R, 6R). Neither matches the options perfectly.\n\n*   **Case 2: Exo Product**\n    *   The dienophile's substituents (-CH₃ groups) are oriented *cis* to the diene's outer substituents.\n    *   Relative stereochemistry: C1-OH is *trans* to C6-CH₃. C4-CH₃ and C5-CH₃ are *cis* to each other. The {C4-Me, C5-Me} pair is *cis* to C1-OH and *trans* to C6-CH₃.\n    *   Let's assign this relative geometry (e.g., C1-OH up; C6-Me down; C4-Me up; C5-Me up) and determine the absolute configurations (R/S).\n        *   One enantiomer is found to be **(1R, 4S, 5R, 6S)**.\n        *   The other enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The stereoisomer **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol** perfectly matches the predicted structure of the exo product's enantiomer. This corresponds to option D. While the endo product is often kinetically preferred, steric factors or thermodynamic control can lead to the exo product. Since the exo product stereochemistry exactly matches an option, it is the intended answer."
