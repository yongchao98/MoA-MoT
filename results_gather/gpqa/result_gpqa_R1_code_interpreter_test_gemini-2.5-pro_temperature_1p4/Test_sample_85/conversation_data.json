    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The structure has a single chiral center at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\nLet's draw this structure:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end.\n*   An isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end.\nThe molecule has a single chiral center at carbon C3, which bears the ethyl group. The starting materials A and B can be either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular reaction of a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or its derivative (like an ester). The starting material has no hydroxyl group, so one of the carbonyl groups must be reduced to an alcohol by the reducing agent.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Reagent is LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n            This intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbon in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituent groups.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Reagent is BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is a reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` --(BH₃)--> `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n            This intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl carbon in an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, displacing isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement is preserved. We must check how the CIP priorities change.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nLet's analyze the change in CIP priorities for both reactions.\n\n*   **Priority Assignment in Starting Material:**\n    The chiral center is C3, attached to H, -Et, `-CH₂-COOH`, and `-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    1.  `-CH₂-COOiBu` (P1) - Highest priority (C of iBu > H of OH).\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (P2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Et) (P3)\n    4.  `H` (P4) - Lowest priority.\n\n*   **Priority Assignment in Product Lactone:**\n    The chiral center is C4, attached to H, -Et, a ring segment towards the carbonyl (`-CH₂-C=O`), and a ring segment towards the ether oxygen (`-CH₂-CH₂-O`).\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (P1') - Highest priority.\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (P2')\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Et) (P3')\n    4.  `H` (P4') - Lowest priority.\n\nNow, let's trace the groups through each reaction:\n\n*   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The ester group (`P1`) is reduced to an alcohol, which becomes the ether-linked part of the lactone (`P2'`).\n    *   The acid group (`P2`) becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone (`P1'`).\n    *   So, the mapping is: **P1 → P2'** and **P2 → P1'**.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A single swap of two groups inverts the stereochemical designation (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n    *   The product is **(R)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material A must have been **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n    *   The acid group (`P2`) is reduced to an alcohol, which becomes the ether-linked part of the lactone (`P2'`).\n    *   The ester group (`P1`) becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone (`P1'`).\n    *   So, the mapping is: **P1 → P1'** and **P2 → P2'**.\n    *   The priority order of the groups is preserved. The stereochemical designation is retained (R remains R, and S remains S).\n    *   The product is **(S)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material B must also have been **(S)**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
