    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard formula from quantum mechanics:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    Therefore, $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$.\n\n    In our case, the operator is $P_z$, so we need to compute:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Define the Given Quantities:**\n    *   **Operator $P_z$**: The problem provides the matrix representation of $P_z$.\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **State Vector $|\\psi\\rangle$**: The system is in the state given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, compute the inner product $\\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We square the matrix for $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, compute the inner product $\\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Final Verification with Code:** To ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed using a numerical tool like Python with NumPy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar to 1 for simplicity in calculation\nhbar = 1\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-1/2],\n                [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n                [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the operator P_z\nPz = hbar * np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate Pz^2\nPz_sq = np.dot(Pz, Pz)\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz\n# <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\nexp_Pz = np.dot(psi.T.conj(), np.dot(Pz, psi))\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2\n# <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz_sq * psi\nexp_Pz_sq = np.dot(psi.T.conj(), np.dot(Pz_sq, psi))\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty squared (variance)\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_sq - exp_Pz**2\n\n# The uncertainty is the square root of the variance\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The final answer is a single value\nprint(uncertainty_Pz.item())\n# The result will be in units of hbar, which we set to 1.\n# 0.7071067811865476 is approximately 1/sqrt(2).\n# So the answer is hbar/sqrt(2).\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.7071067811865476\n</execute_code>\nThe code output is approximately `0.7071`, which is the numerical value for $1/\\sqrt{2}$.
