    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### Target Molecule Analysis\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's visualize the structure:\n- Benzene ring.\n- Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n  - C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n  - C2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃)\n  - C3: nitro group (-NO₂)\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and challenging to synthesize directly. The key is to control the position of electrophilic substitution using the directing effects of the substituents, and potentially using blocking groups.\n\n### Substituent Directing Effects:\n\n*   **-C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's a weak activator and an **ortho, para-director**. Due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the para position.\n*   **-OCH₂CH₃ (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong activator and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro)**: A strong deactivator and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino)**: A very strong activator and an **ortho, para-director**. When protonated in strong acid to **-NH₃⁺**, it becomes a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-SO₃H (sulfonic acid)**: A strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. It is an excellent **blocking group** because it can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n### Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies\n\nThe last step is likely the conversion of a phenol to an ether, as this is a reliable, high-yield reaction.\n*   **Final step**: `Ar-OH + NaOH/EtBr -> Ar-OEt` (Williamson ether synthesis).\n*   This means the precursor to our target is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nThe problem now is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze the options provided.\n\n**Option B and D Analysis:**\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃...` This starts by making aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and leading to meta-alkylation, if any reaction occurs. This is not the desired outcome.\n*   **Option D**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...` This sequence starts with tert-butylbenzene, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, nitration overwhelmingly yields the *para* isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene). Following the subsequent steps leads to a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n**Option A and C Analysis:**\n\nThese two options use the same set of reagents but in a different order. They both include sulfonation, which suggests the use of a blocking group strategy. This strategy is essential to overcome the preference for para-substitution of the tert-butyl group.\n\nLet's construct the most logical sequence using the reagents from options A and C:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**. `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-butylbenzene`. This must be the first step, as Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with deactivating groups like -NO₂ or -SO₃H.\n    *(This step is `i)` in both A and C)*.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**. `tert-butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The bulky -SO₃H group is introduced at the para position, which is sterically accessible and electronically favored. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n    *(This step is `ii)` in C, but `iii)` in A, which is out of order)*.\n\n3.  **Step 3: First Nitration**. `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Now that the para position is blocked, nitration is directed to the ortho position relative to the t-butyl group.\n    *(This step is `iii)` in C)*.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction**. `... + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This amino group will be used as a director for the next substitution before being converted to the final ethoxy group.\n    *(This step is `iv)` in C)*.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Second Nitration**. The sequence must introduce a second nitro group, which will be the one in the final product. We nitrate `4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`. Under nitrating conditions (strong acid), the -NH₂ group is protonated to -NH₃⁺, which is a meta-director. However, the t-butyl and sulfonic acid groups both direct to positions C3 and C5. If the amine is protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH₃, a common technique implied in such problems), it becomes a strong ortho,para-director. All three groups (-NHAc, -tBu, -SO₃H) would then strongly direct an incoming electrophile to position C3. This leads to `4-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n6.  **Step 6: Diazotization**. `... + NaNO₂/HCl → ...`. The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n\n7.  **Step 7: Hydrolysis to Phenol**. `... + H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat → 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. The diazonium salt is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n\n8.  **Step 8: Desulfonation**. `... + dilute H₂SO₄/Heat → 3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`. The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed. Note that upon removal of the higher priority groups, the IUPAC numbering of the resulting phenol changes.\n\n9.  **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis**. `3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`. The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n\nWait, the product from this logical sequence is `1-ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`, which is an isomer of the target molecule `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There appears to be a subtle flaw in this analysis or an error in the question's target molecule name.\n\nLet's re-examine Step 5. What if the second nitration occurs at position 5 instead of 3? This would ultimately lead to `5-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`, still not the correct precursor. What if it occurs at C6? This leads to `3-tert-butyl-5-nitrophenol`, also incorrect.\n\nGiven the choices, there is likely an error in the question itself or its options. However, if forced to choose the *best* option, we should select the one with the most chemically sound strategy.\n\n*   Options B and D are fundamentally flawed for reasons explained above.\n*   Options A and C present the correct set of reagents for a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions, which is required for such a complex target.\n*   Option C presents the initial, critical steps (alkylation, para-blocking, ortho-nitration, reduction) in the most logical order (i → ii → iii → iv). The sequence in Option A is not logical as written (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the most plausible synthetic strategy, despite the apparent isomer issue that may stem from a typo in the question.\n\n```python\n# This is a conceptual representation.\n# It does not simulate chemical reactions but outlines the logic.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis options for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n    The target has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (OEt, tBu, NO2). This is sterically hindered.\n    A high-yield synthesis requires careful control of directing effects.\n\n    Analysis of options:\n    - B: Fails at Friedel-Crafts on aniline.\n    - D: Nitration of t-butylbenzene gives mainly the para-product, leading to a 1,2,4-substituted final product, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n    This leaves A and C, which use a blocking group strategy. Let's trace the most logical path using their reagents.\n    1. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (Benzene -> t-butylbenzene).\n    2. Sulfonation (to block the para position -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid).\n    3. Nitration (forced to go ortho -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid).\n    4.

    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents introduced at each step.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Substituents are located at adjacent positions C1, C2, and C3.\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strongly activating ortho,para-director.\n    *   C2: -C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl group), a weakly activating, bulky ortho,para-director.\n    *   C3: -NO₂ (nitro group), a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a sterically crowded 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative in high yield requires a carefully controlled sequence of reactions. Standard electrophilic substitution reactions on simple precursors would lead to a mixture of isomers, not the desired single product. This points towards a strategy involving **blocking groups** to control the position of substitution.\n\n### 2. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each synthetic route step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃: Forms tert-butylbenzene. OK.\nii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group strongly directs the nitro group to the para position. This path leads to a 1,4-disubstituted product, not the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted one.\niv) NaNO₂/HCl: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). There is no amine present at this stage.\n**Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO₃/H₂SO₄: Forms nitrobenzene. OK.\nii) Fe/HCl: Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline. OK.\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen of the amine group coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a highly deactivated ring (-NH₃⁺).\n**Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃: Forms tert-butylbenzene. OK.\nii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄: As discussed for Option A, this step overwhelmingly yields p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent reactions will lead to a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3 isomer.\n**Conclusion: Option D will not produce the target molecule in high yield.**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option employs a more complex strategy which is necessary for this type of synthesis.\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). This must be the first step as Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on deactivated rings.\nii) **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: tert-Butylbenzene → **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. Sulfonation occurs at the para position, which is electronically favored and sterically accessible. This step uses the -SO₃H group as a **blocking group** to prevent reaction at the para position.\niii) **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the ortho position relative to the t-butyl group. This is the key step for establishing the 1,2 relationship between the t-butyl and a nitro group.\niv) **Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nv) **NaNO₂/HCl**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\nvi-ix) The subsequent steps are designed to convert the remaining functional groups into the final target structure. While the exact order of steps (vi) to (viii) appears illogical as written (nitrating a diazonium salt is not standard), the set of reagents and the overall strategy are correct in principle. The plan is to:\n    *   Introduce the final nitro group.\n    *   Convert the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (-OH) via heating in water (`H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat`).\n    *   Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group (`dilute H₂SO₄`).\n    *   Convert the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\n**Conclusion:** By a process of elimination, Options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed. Option C outlines the only plausible strategy—using a blocking group—to synthesize a complex molecule like the target. The initial four steps are perfectly logical and correctly set up the required substitution pattern. Despite a likely typo in the ordering of the later steps, it represents the most chemically sound approach among the choices.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_synthesis_options():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chemical feasibility of four synthesis routes.\n    The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n    - Option A: Fails because it attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amine group.\n    - Option B: Fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline.\n    - Option D: Fails to produce the correct 1,2,3 isomer, as nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields the 1,4 isomer as the major product.\n    - Option C: Employs a sophisticated and correct strategy for this type of molecule.\n        1.

    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must evaluate the chemical feasibility and regioselectivity of each proposed route.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule and Strategy\n\nThe target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. This arrangement is sterically crowded, and its high-yield synthesis requires careful control over the directing effects of substituents. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work due to the formation of undesired isomers. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO₃/H₂SO₄`) and subsequent desulfonation (`dilute H₂SO₄`) strongly suggests that a **blocking group strategy** is required. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is used to temporarily occupy a position (usually the para position) to force subsequent substituents into other desired locations, and is then removed later in the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **Option A**: This sequence fails early on. Step (ii) would nitrate tert-butylbenzene primarily at the *para* position, not leading to the 1,2,3-pattern. Furthermore, step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is performed without an amine functional group being present, which is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence starts by making aniline (`i` and `ii`). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic lone pair on the amine, deactivating the ring towards alkylation.\n\n*   **Option D**: This sequence also fails on regioselectivity. Step (ii) involves the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director that heavily favors substitution at the sterically unhindered *para* position. This leads to 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene as the major product, which cannot be converted into the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted final product.\n\n*   **Option C**: This sequence presents the only viable strategy using a blocking group.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: This correctly performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄**: This step introduces a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) group at the *para* position of tert-butylbenzene, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This effectively **blocks** the para position from further substitution.\n    3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at an *ortho* position relative to the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the crucial step that establishes the 1,2 relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    5.  **Remaining steps (v-ix)**: The remaining reagents are used to install the final nitro and ethoxy groups and remove the blocking group. Although the order listed might seem slightly confusing, the reagents are correct for the necessary transformations: diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), conversion to a phenol (`H₃O⁺/Heat`), introduction of the final nitro group (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`), removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group (`dilute H₂SO₄`), and finally, Williamson ether synthesis to form the ethoxy group (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\nBy a process of elimination and by recognizing the necessary blocking group strategy, Option C is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
