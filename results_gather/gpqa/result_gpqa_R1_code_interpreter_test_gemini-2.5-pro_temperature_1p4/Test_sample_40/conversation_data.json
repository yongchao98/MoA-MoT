    "This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the addition of velocities. It's often associated with the Fizeau experiment. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which we consider stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference of the moving block of glass. It is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured *inside* the glass frame (S'). By the definition of the index of refraction `n`, the speed of light in the medium (when the medium is at rest) is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The classical Galilean formula for adding velocities (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate for speeds approaching the speed of light. We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula. For motion along a single axis, the formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values from step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives us:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result perfectly matches option B.\n\nNo numerical computation is required for this problem, as it is a symbolic derivation. The steps are purely based on the application of the correct physical formula and algebraic manipulation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
