    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and its reaction to form B.**\n*   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6. This fits the general formula CnH2n, which corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a classic test for unsaturation (presence of a double bond). Alkenes readily undergo this electrophilic addition reaction, while cycloalkanes are generally less reactive under these conditions (cyclopropane being an exception, but the subsequent reactions point towards an alkene).\n*   The alkene with formula C3H6 is propene (CH3-CH=CH2).\n*   Propene reacts with Br2 in CCl4 to add bromine atoms across the double bond.\n    `CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)`\n*   So, **A is Propene** and **B is 1,2-Dibromopropane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound C.**\n*   Compound B (1,2-Dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Using a strong base like alcoholic KOH on a vicinal dihalide typically eliminates two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne.\n    `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 alc. KOH --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n*   So, **C is Propyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D.**\n*   Compound C (Propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes to form aromatic compounds.\n*   Three molecules of propyne (CH3-C≡CH) will polymerize to form a trimethylbenzene. Due to symmetry and stability considerations, the major product is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n*   So, **D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound E.**\n*   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This mixture is the nitrating mixture, consisting of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This performs electrophilic aromatic nitration.\n*   The three methyl groups in mesitylene are activating and direct the incoming electrophile (the nitronium ion, NO2+) to the positions ortho and para to them. In mesitylene, positions 2, 4, and 6 are all equivalent and available for substitution.\n*   So, **E is 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Nitromesitylene)**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound F.**\n*   Compound E (Nitromesitylene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n*   So, **F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound G.**\n*   Compound F (Mesidine), a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically generated in situ from NaNO2 and a strong acid like HCl at low temperatures (0-5 °C). This reaction is called diazotization.\n*   So, **G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt** (e.g., 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride).\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound H.**\n*   Compound G (the diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide. In an aqueous solution, warming a diazonium salt leads to its hydrolysis, where the diazonium group (-N2+) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol. The NaOH helps to neutralize the acidic conditions.\n*   So, **H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitol)**.\n\n**Evaluating the Statements:**\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C. At standard room temperature, it is a gas. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine). Primary aromatic amines are crucial starting materials for the synthesis of azo dyes via diazotization and coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        1.  The nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with).\n        2.  The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and will produce a second single signal, also a singlet.\n    *   Therefore, the spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The neutral ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a distinct violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored [Fe(OAr)6]3- complex.\n    *   However, this test often fails for sterically hindered phenols, particularly those with substituents at both ortho-positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbon bearing the -OH group). In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, both ortho-positions (2 and 6) are substituted with methyl groups. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with the Fe3+ ion.\n    *   Consequently, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test. No characteristic color change occurs. The solution will simply retain the pale yellow/brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself.\n    *   The statement that it \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow product. In reality, a negative test results in a yellow solution (the color of the unreacted reagent). Therefore, this statement is considered **incorrect**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Statements A, B, and C are correct. Statement D is incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
