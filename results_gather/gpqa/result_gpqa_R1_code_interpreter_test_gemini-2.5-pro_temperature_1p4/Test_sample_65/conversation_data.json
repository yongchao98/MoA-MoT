    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed to parameterize the effects of new physics at energy scales higher than the electroweak scale. The construction of SMEFT is based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. This is a fundamental assumption about the nature of spacetime. SMEFT is constructed to be a local, effective quantum field theory, and as such, it must respect Lorentz invariance. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime, including Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a foundational principle of the Standard Model and any well-behaved quantum field theory describing particle physics. The action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime, must be invariant under Poincaré transformations. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, primarily through a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix governing quark mixing in the weak interactions. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to be CP-symmetric. In fact, many higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. It states that any such theory is automatically invariant under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. Every term in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is *not* required to be respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to the set {1, 2, 4}.\n\n<<<B>>>"
