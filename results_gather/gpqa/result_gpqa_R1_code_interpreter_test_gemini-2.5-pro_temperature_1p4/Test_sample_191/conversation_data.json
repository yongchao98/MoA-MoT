    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, this charge `+q` will induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To see this, imagine a Gaussian surface completely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    `Q_enclosed = Q_inside_cavity + Q_induced_inner = +q + Q_induced_inner = 0`\n    `=> Q_induced_inner = -q`.\n    The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform to ensure the electric field is cancelled within the conductor.\n\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    `Q_conductor_total = Q_induced_inner + Q_induced_outer = -q + Q_induced_outer = 0` (since it was initially neutral).\n    `=> Q_induced_outer = +q`.\n\n**2. The Principle of Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage)**\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is electrostatic shielding.\n*   The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. This field is the superposition of the fields from three sources: (1) the charge `+q` in the cavity, (2) the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and (3) the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n*   Let's group the first two sources together: the \"cavity system\" (`+q` inside and `-q` on the inner wall). The charge `-q` on the inner wall arranges itself precisely to make the potential on the cavity wall constant. A key result of electrostatics (a consequence of the uniqueness theorem) is that such a system (charges enclosed by an equipotential surface) produces **zero electric field everywhere outside that surface**.\n*   Therefore, the field produced by the \"cavity system\" is zero throughout the conducting material and also at the point P, which is outside the conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of the Outer Charge**\n\n*   We established that `E_total = E_cavity_system + E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor.\n*   Since `E_cavity_system = 0` inside the conductor (as it's outside the cavity), it must be that `E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor as well.\n*   `E_outer_surface` is the electric field produced by the charge `+q` residing on the outer spherical surface. The only way a charge distribution on a spherical shell can produce zero electric field at all points inside it is if the charge is distributed **uniformly** over the surface.\n*   Therefore, the `+q` charge on the outer surface of the conductor is distributed uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge `+q` inside it.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   The total electric field at point P is the sum of the fields from the cavity system and the outer surface charge: `E(P) = E_cavity_system(P) + E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   As established in step 2, the field from the cavity system is zero outside the cavity: `E_cavity_system(P) = 0`.\n*   Thus, the field at P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor: `E(P) = E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to the outside of the sphere), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In this case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`, and its center is the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge `q` at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n`E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / L²) `\n\nThis result depends only on the charge `q` placed in the cavity and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor. The other parameters (`r`, `R`, `s`, `l`, `θ`) are extraneous details intended to test the understanding of the shielding principle.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
