    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have standard hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism:**\n\nThe reaction occurs in two main steps:\n*   **Step 1: Elimination to form a benzyne intermediate.**\n*   **Step 2: Addition of the nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate.**\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne)**\n\nThe strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Bears a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Bears a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, since the question asks for *all possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**, as the deuterium at C2 is unaffected.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is the parent **benzyne** molecule (C₆H₄), as the deuterium has been removed.\n\nThus, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two positions are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of the -NH₂ and -D groups are 1 and 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical.\n    *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\n**Summary of Possible Products:**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways for the mechanism, we identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are all different (aniline and its deuterated isotopomers). Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n<<<B>>>"
