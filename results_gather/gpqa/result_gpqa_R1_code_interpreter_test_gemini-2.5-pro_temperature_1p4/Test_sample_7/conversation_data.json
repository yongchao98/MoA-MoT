As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutants**\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product is responsible for a portion (100% - 75% = 25%) of the plant's total resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means the G3 gene product is responsible for a larger portion (100% - 50% = 50%) of the resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype. Its absence completely eliminates resistance.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Genetic Interactions (Epistasis)**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. We can detect this by comparing the phenotype of a double mutant to the phenotypes of the corresponding single mutants. If the double mutant's phenotype is identical to one of the single mutant's phenotypes, that single mutant's gene is considered epistatic to the other gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:**\n    *   g1 phenotype = 75% resistance\n    *   g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   g1g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. We can conclude that **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:**\n    *   g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   g3 phenotype = 50% resistance\n    *   g2g3 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. We can conclude that **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n**3. Formulate a Pathway Hypothesis**\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it suggests that G2 acts downstream of G1 and G3 in the same pathway, or that G2 is an upstream regulator required for the function of both G1 and G3.\n\nThe problem states, \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).\"\n\nThe model where G2 is an upstream transcription factor (`G2 -> G1` and `G2 -> G3`) fits the data perfectly. If G2 is required to activate both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning, leading to a complete loss of resistance (0%). This aligns with the `g2`, `g1g2`, and `g2g3` mutant phenotypes. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor.**\n\nThis finding eliminates option A, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**4. Analyze the Relationship between G1 and G3**\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:**\n    *   g1 phenotype = 75% resistance\n    *   g3 phenotype = 50% resistance\n    *   g1g3 phenotype = 10% resistance\n    *   The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as either single mutant, so there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   Instead, the phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant. The loss of resistance in the double mutant (90%) is greater than the sum of the losses in the single mutants (25% from g1 + 50% from g3 = 75%). This synergistic effect is a classic indicator of **gene redundancy**. It means that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways (both activated by G2) and can partially compensate for each other's absence. When both are knocked out, the phenotype is drastically worse.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nLet's re-examine options B, C, and D based on our conclusions:\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a transcription factor. (Consistent with B, C, D)\n*   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. (Consistent with D)\n*   **Conclusion 3:** There is no epistasis between G1 and G3. (Options B, C, and D all contain an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3).\n\nWe must choose the best possible answer.\n*   **Option B:** States G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits). We cannot determine this from the given data, which only measures one trait (resistance). It also contains an incorrect epistasis claim.\n*   **Option C:** States G1 and G3 have the same promoter. This is possible but less likely, as their individual knockouts have different quantitative effects on resistance (75% vs 50%). It also contains an incorrect epistasis claim.\n*   **Option D:** It correctly identifies **G2 as a transcription factor** and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as **gene redundancy**. These are the two most significant and well-supported conclusions from the data. Although it contains an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 (likely an error in the question itself), it captures the essential biology far better than the other options.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the best and most comprehensive conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<D>>>"
