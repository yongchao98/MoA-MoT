    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, meaning there are four hydrogens on the ring itself. This gives us a core fragment of **C6H4**.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R', which contains two oxygen atoms. This means the formula must be C?H?**O2**. All the given options satisfy this.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information for determining the number of hydrogen and carbon atoms.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six chemically distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** Consistent with a para (1,4) substituted benzene ring, which has 4 aromatic protons that are chemically divided into two distinct sets. Total hydrogens from the aromatic ring = **4H**.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl proton). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `CH3` group would be a doublet of quartets (split by the other vinyl proton and the three protons of the `CH3` group). This fragment accounts for two vinyl hydrogens and a `C=C` double bond. Total hydrogens from the vinyl group = **2H**.\n        *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups.\n            *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) identified above. Its signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton. This accounts for **3H**.\n            *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent. This accounts for another **3H**.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It constrains the structure of the ester group. It cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or have any other methylene bridges. Given that it must contain a methyl group, the ester substituent is either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group attached via the oxygen (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n\n2.  **Count the Total Number of Hydrogens:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring: 4H\n    *   From the vinyl group: 2H\n    *   From the two methyl groups: 3H + 3H = 6H\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12H.**\n    *   This result eliminates options A (C12H14O2) and C (C11H14O2). We are left with B (C11H12O2) and D (C12H12O2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Total Number of Carbons:**\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** 6 carbons (C6)\n    *   **Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`):** 3 carbons (C3)\n    *   **Ester group containing a methyl group:** As determined above, this is either `-COOCH3` or `-O-CO-CH3`.\n        *   In `-COOCH3`, there is one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and one methyl carbon (`-CH3`). Total = 2 carbons (C2).\n        *   In `-O-CO-CH3`, there is one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and one methyl carbon (`-CH3`). Total = 2 carbons (C2).\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent contribute 2 carbons.\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11C.**\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Total Carbons: 11\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 12\n    *   Total Oxygens: 2 (from the ester group)\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option B. Let's write a small Python script to verify the atom counting from the identified fragments. The fragments are C6H4 (aromatic ring), C3H5 (propenyl group), and C2H3O2 (methyl ester group).\n\n```python\n# Define the atomic composition of each fragment\nfragment_1 = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}  # C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring)\nfragment_2 = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}  # C3H5 (propenyl group -CH=CH-CH3)\nfragment_3 = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}  # C2H3O2 (methyl ester -COOCH3 or acetate -OOCCH3)\n\n# Initialize total atom counts\ntotal_atoms = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n\n# Sum the atoms from all fragments\nfor fragment in [fragment_1, fragment_2, fragment_3]:\n    for atom, count in fragment.items():\n        total_atoms[atom] += count\n\n# Format the final molecular formula\nformula = f\"C{total_atoms['C']}H{total_atoms['H']}O{total_atoms['O']}\"\n\nprint(formula)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and thinking process has been performed, and the chemical formula has been determined to be C11H12O2. The python code execution has confirmed this calculation. The final answer can now be provided.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring and Substituents:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** fragment, which accounts for **6 carbons and 4 hydrogens**.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". This is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, where the four ring protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs, giving two signals. This confirms the presence of 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from Spectra:**\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester group (R-COO-R'). An ester contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This eliminates any options that do not have O2 in the formula. All given options have O2, so they are all initially possible.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This pattern, along with one of the –CH3 signals (which would be a doublet), strongly indicates a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This substituent contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (`-CH`(vinyl)+`=CH`(vinyl)+`-CH3`(methyl)).\n    *   **Ester's Alkyl Group:** The NMR shows two distinct –CH3 signals. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must belong to the ester group. Since there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\", the ester cannot be, for example, an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group attached through oxygen (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes a methyl group (`-CH3`) and a carbonyl group (`-C=O`). This accounts for **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygen atoms**.\n\n3.  **Sum the Atoms:**\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from methyl ester group) = **11 carbons**.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from methyl ester group) = **12 hydrogens**. (Alternatively, counting directly from NMR signals: 4 aromatic H + 2 vinyl H + 2 x 3 methyl H = 12 H).\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n4.  **Final Formula:**\n    *   Combining the counts gives the molecular formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
