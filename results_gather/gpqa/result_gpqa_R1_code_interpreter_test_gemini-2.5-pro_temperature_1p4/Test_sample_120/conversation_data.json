    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The \"7-oxa\" indicates that the CH₂ group of the cyclopropane (at position 7) is replaced by an oxygen atom, forming an epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6. These are the two carbons of the epoxide ring that can be attacked.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The problem explicitly states a key rule for this reaction: \"When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must determine which one is less hindered.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group (in addition to being part of the ring). This makes it a tertiary carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C6 has no substituent other than a hydrogen atom (and being part of the ring). This makes it a secondary carbon of the epoxide.\n*   Comparing a tertiary carbon (C1) to a secondary carbon (C6), C6 is clearly the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n\n*   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs from the backside of the C-O bond.\n*   Since the attack is at C6, the stereocenter at C6 will undergo inversion. The initial configuration is 6S, so the product will have an R configuration at this carbon.\n*   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-making or bond-breaking (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their relative spatial arrangement. We assume their absolute configuration R/S designation will also be retained, but we will verify this later if needed.\n\n**4. Predict the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Reaction Path:**\n    1.  The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6.\n    2.  The C6-O bond breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n    3.  This opens the epoxide ring, forming a lithium alkoxide where the oxygen is still attached to C1.\n    4.  A subsequent workup step (implied, usually with water) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   At the position of original C1: one -OH group and one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C3: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C4: one -Me group.\n    *   At the position of original C6: the newly added -Me group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) receives the lowest possible number, which is **C1**.\n    2.  We number the rest of the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering clockwise towards the original C6 position: Me groups are at C1, C2 (from old C6), C4 (from old C4), and C5 (from old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Starting at the new C1 and numbering counter-clockwise towards the original C2 position: Me groups are at C1, C3 (from old C3), C4 (from old C4), and C6 (from old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    3.  Comparing the two sets {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, the correct numbering gives the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the naming in options A and D.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   We need to find the configuration (R or S) of the chiral centers in the product: new C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n*   We trace the configuration from the reactant to the product based on the numbering we just established:\n    *   **New C2 comes from old C6:** The reaction at this center causes inversion of configuration. Reactant C6 is S, so product C2 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C1 comes from old C1:** This center is not attacked, so its 3D arrangement is preserved. The R/S designation depends on substituent priorities. In both reactant (C1 bonded to O, C6, C2, Me) and product (C1 bonded to OH, C2, C6, Me), the priority order of the four groups remains the same (O/OH > C-neighbor with more Me > C-neighbor with fewer Me > Me). Therefore, the configuration is retained. Reactant C1 is R, so product C1 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C4 comes from old C4:** This center is remote from the reaction site. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C4 is R, so product C4 will be **R**.\n    *   **New C5 comes from old C3:** This center is also remote. Its configuration is retained. Reactant C3 is R, so product C5 will be **R**.\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry:** Combining these findings, the product has the configuration (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
