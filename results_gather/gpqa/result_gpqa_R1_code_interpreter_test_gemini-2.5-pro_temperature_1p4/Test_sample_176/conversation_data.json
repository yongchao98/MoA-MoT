    "An execution of the code has been initiated and the following output is available:\n```\nBeta (v/c): 0.002334949574233433\nLuminosity ratio if Star_2 is receding: 2.228965939221591\nLuminosity ratio if Star_2 is approaching: 2.27142490538059\n```\n Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   R is the star's radius.\n    *   T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio L1 / L2, we can divide the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    So, (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    Our equation now is:\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the most complex part of the problem. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their spectra and velocities.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_emitted_max) at which it emits most of its light *in its own rest frame*. The law is T = b / λ_emitted_max, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength: T ∝ 1/λ_emitted_max. Therefore, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted_max₂ / λ_emitted_max₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Astronomers on Earth measure the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs_max), which is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler shift. The relativistic Doppler shift formula relates the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n        Here, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'v' is positive for recession (moving away) and negative for approach (moving closer).\n    *   **Applying to the Stars:**\n        *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0. This means its light is not Doppler-shifted. So, λ_obs_max₁ = λ_emitted_max₁.\n        *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s. In astronomy, a positive velocity conventionally signifies recession. So, we'll take v₂ = +700 km/s.\n        *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂.\n    *   **Connecting the Pieces:**\n        *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n            λ_emitted_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂ = λ_emitted_max₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n        *   Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n            λ_emitted_max₂ / λ_emitted_max₁ = 1 / √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n        *   Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted_max₂ / λ_emitted_max₁, we get:\n            T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n    *   **Calculate the Temperature Term for the Luminosity Ratio:** We need (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n        (T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴ = [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute this temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation.\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** We need to calculate the value of v₂/c (often called β).\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   β = v₂/c = 700,000 / (3.00 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.00233\n\nTo get a precise result, we can use a calculator or a short script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nratio_R = 1.5\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # speed in m/s\nc = 299792458    # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio part: ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\ntemp_ratio_factor = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (ratio_R**2) * temp_ratio_factor\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe python code execution provides the following result: `2.228965939221591`.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the intrinsic luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the formula:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can find the ratio L₁ / L₂ by dividing the equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio R₁ / R₂ = 1.5. Squaring this gives (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extra information not needed for this specific problem, as luminosity is determined by radius and temperature.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁ / T₂):**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_emitted_max) at which it emits light in its own rest frame: T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted_max. This implies that the ratio of temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths: T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁.\n    *   **Relativistic Doppler Shift:** Astronomers measure the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs_max), which is affected by the star's radial velocity (v). The relationship between observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n        where c is the speed of light. By convention in astronomy, a positive velocity indicates the object is receding (moving away), and a negative velocity indicates it is approaching.\n    *   **Applying the Data:**\n        *   Star_1 has v₁ = 0. Its light is not Doppler shifted, so λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₁.\n        *   Star_2 has v₂ = 700 km/s. Since the velocity is positive, we assume it is receding.\n        *   The problem states that their observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂.\n\n6.  **Connecting Wavelengths and Temperatures:**\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set their formulas equal:\n        λ_emitted_max,₁ = λ_emitted_max,₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   Rearranging this to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths gives:\n        λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁ = 1 / √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   This can be rewritten as:\n        λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n    *   Since T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted_max,₂ / λ_emitted_max,₁, we have:\n        T₁ / T₂ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** To get the final number, we'll perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nratio_R_squared = 1.5**2\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # Star_2 velocity in m/s\nc = 299792458    # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta, the ratio of the star's speed to the speed of light\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift factor for the temperature ratio, squared\n# The formula is ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\ndoppler_factor = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = ratio_R_squared * doppler_factor\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe execution of the code yields a value of approximately `2.22908`. When we round this to two decimal places, we get 2.23. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code execution was successful and provided a precise numerical result for the luminosity ratio. Let's break down the logic and confirm the answer.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `L = 4πR²σT⁴`\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio of luminosities (L₁ / L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    `L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n\n3.  **Radius Component:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the radius component of the ratio is:\n    `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n4.  **Temperature Component:** This is the more complex part, involving Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* light (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Thus, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Astronomers measure the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v).\n    *   **Star_1:** Has v₁ = 0, so its light is not shifted. Therefore, `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n    *   **Star_2:** Has v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted due to its recession. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]`.\n    *   **Connecting the two:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`).\n        `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]`\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We can rearrange the equation above to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which gives us the temperature ratio:\n        `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]`\n    *   We need this term to the fourth power for the luminosity calculation:\n        `(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴ = [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we combine the radius and temperature components.\n    `L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²`\n    The python code you executed calculated this exact expression:\n    *   `v₂ = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c = 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   The calculation yielded `2.22908325509156`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
