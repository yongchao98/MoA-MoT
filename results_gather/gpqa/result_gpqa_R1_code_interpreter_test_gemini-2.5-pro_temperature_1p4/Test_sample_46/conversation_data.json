    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula to calculate DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O) or a ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amine has two N-H bonds, giving rise to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. A simple alkyl ester is usually around 1735-1750 cm-1, but conjugation with a benzene ring lowers the frequency into the observed range.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's analyze each signal by its chemical shift (ppm), multiplicity (t=triplet, q=quartet, d=doublet, bs=broad singlet), and integration (number of protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a classic methyl group (CH3, 3H) that is adjacent to a methylene group (CH2), causing it to be a triplet (2+1=3 peaks).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a methylene group (CH2, 2H) that is adjacent to a methyl group (CH3), causing it to be a quartet (3+1=4 peaks). Its very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine group (-NH2)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The two substituents have different electronic properties. One must be an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the ortho protons and shifts them upfield (to a lower ppm value). The other must be an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the ortho protons and shifts them downfield (to a higher ppm value).\n    *   The -NH2 group is a strong EDG.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) is a strong EWG.\n    *   Therefore, the signal at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) as one substituent.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) as the other substituent.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the primary amine data (IR and NMR). It would also show a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester with a propionate group. The NMR signal for the -CO-CH2- protons would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR for a phenyl ester C=O would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm-1).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data:\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2.\n    *   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH2) and conjugated ester C=O.\n    *   **1H NMR:** An ethyl ester group, a primary amine group, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate chemical shifts for the EDG (-NH2) and EWG (-COOEt).\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
