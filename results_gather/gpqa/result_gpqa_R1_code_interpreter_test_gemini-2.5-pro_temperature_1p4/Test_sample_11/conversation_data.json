    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes a particle decay process. The fundamental principles governing this are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles might be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is equal to the total energy after the decay.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay is equal to the total momentum after the decay.\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n\n**2. Define the State Before and After Decay**\n\n*   **Before Decay:**\n    *   The particle is a positive pion `Pi(+)`.\n    *   It is stationary, which means its initial velocity is zero.\n    *   Therefore, its initial momentum `p_initial` is 0.\n    *   Its initial energy `E_initial` is purely its rest energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Given `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n\n*   **After Decay:**\n    *   The products are a positive muon `mu(+)` and a muon neutrino `nu`.\n    *   Let their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`, and their total energies be `E_mu` and `E_nu`.\n    *   The final total energy is `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   The final total momentum is `p_final = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum).\n    *   Given `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   The neutrino `nu` is considered to be massless, so `m_nu = 0`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and the neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p_mu = -p_nu`. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of each particle: `p = |p_mu| = |p_nu|`.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**4. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon `mu(+)`:\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the massless neutrino `nu` (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2`\n    `E_nu = p*c`\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies of the Products**\n\nWe now have a system of equations. We can solve for the unknown energies.\n\n1.  Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c`\n    Rearrange to find `p*c`:\n    `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n3.  Expand the squared term:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n4.  The `E_mu^2` term cancels on both sides. Rearrange to solve for `E_mu`:\n    `0 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_mu + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `2 * (m_pi * c^2) * E_mu = (m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi * c^2]`\n\n5.  Now we can calculate the energy of the neutrino `E_nu` using the energy conservation equation:\n    `E_nu = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n    An alternative, and often simpler, way to find `E_nu` directly is to substitute `E_mu` instead of `p*c`. From `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`, we have `(p*c)^2 = E_mu^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`. Since `E_nu = p*c`, we use `m_pi*c^2 = E_mu + E_nu => E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`. Substituting this gives a direct formula for `E_nu`:\n    `E_nu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi*c^2]`\n\nLet's use the latter formula for `E_nu` as it's computationally simpler.\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet `m_pi = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu = 105.7 MeV`.\n\n*   **Calculate the energy of the neutrino (`E_nu`):**\n    `E_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n    `E_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n*   **Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Calculate the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`):**\n    From energy conservation:\n    `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n    `E_mu = 139.6 - 29.78`\n    `E_mu = 109.82 MeV`\n\n*   **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.\n    `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n    `KE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7`\n    `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values for rest masses (in MeV/c^2), which are equivalent to rest energies (in MeV).\nm_pi = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Calculate the energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# Formula: E_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) from energy conservation.\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu => m_pi = E_mu + E_nu\nE_mu = m_pi - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu).\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu (rest energy of muon)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places.\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics, specifically a two-body decay of a particle at rest. We will solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State (Before Decay)**\n*   The particle is a positive pion `Pi(+)`.\n*   It is stationary, so its initial velocity is zero.\n*   Initial Momentum, `p_initial = 0`.\n*   Initial Energy, `E_initial`, is its rest energy: `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n**2. Final State (After Decay)**\n*   The products are a positive muon `mu(+)` and a muon neutrino `nu`.\n*   Let their momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`, and their total energies be `E_mu` and `E_nu`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude `p`:\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `E_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n    Using the given rest energy of the pion, we have:\n    `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**4. Using the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2`\n\n*   **For the muon `mu(+)`:**\n    `E_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    Here `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`.\n\n*   **For the neutrino `nu`:**\n    Neutrinos are considered massless (or have negligible mass) in this context. So, `m_nu = 0`.\n    `E_nu^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2`\n    `E_nu = pc`\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. Thus, `KE_nu = E_nu`.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies**\nWe now have a system of equations to solve.\n\n1.  From the energy-momentum relation of the neutrino, we have `pc = E_nu`.\n2.  Substitute `pc` in the muon's energy-momentum equation: `E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`.\n3.  From energy conservation, we have `E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu`.\n4.  Substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the equation from step 2:\n    `(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2`\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    `139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 * E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + 105.7^2`\n6.  The `E_nu^2` terms cancel out. Now, we solve for `E_nu`:\n    `19488.16 - 279.2 * E_nu = 11172.49`\n    `19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 * E_nu`\n    `8315.67 = 279.2 * E_nu`\n    `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculating Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (`KE_nu`)**:\n    As established, for the massless neutrino, `KE_nu = E_nu`.\n    `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`)**:\n    First, find the total energy of the muon using the energy conservation equation:\n    `E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV`\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n    `KE_mu = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\nThis result matches the values in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
