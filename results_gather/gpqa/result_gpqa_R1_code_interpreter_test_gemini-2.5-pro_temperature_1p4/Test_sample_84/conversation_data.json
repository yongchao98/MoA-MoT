    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Goal**\n\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio**\n\nTo find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, we set up the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also specifies that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This allows us to determine the star's radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n\nThe RV amplitude $K$ is given by the Doppler formula:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit viewed edge-on (which is a good assumption since transits are also observed), the star's RV amplitude $K$ is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$) by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p}{K} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star}}}$\n$a = \\left( \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{G}{M_{star}} \\right)$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{G}{M_{star}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{G}{M_{star}} \\right)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nWe know that $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nTaking the square root simplifies the expression to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**7. Substitute the Numerical Values**\n\nNow, plug in the values from the problem:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nM_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses for Planet 1\nM_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses for Planet 2\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# T_eq_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nT_eq_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(T_eq_ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result ~0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>",
