    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, purification of the desired product from byproducts and starting materials is a crucial step. The most common purification technique is chromatography (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis or column chromatography for bulk separation).\n\nLet's break down the chemist's statement and the options:\n\n*   **The statement:** \"My compounds are on top of each other.\" This is a common colloquialism used by chemists. It visually describes the result of a failed separation attempt, particularly in chromatography. When running a TLC plate, for example, chemists spot the reaction mixture at the bottom and let a solvent (the mobile phase) run up the plate (the stationary phase). Compounds separate based on how strongly they adhere to the stationary phase versus how well they dissolve in the mobile phase. If two compounds appear as a single, overlapping spot on the TLC plate instead of two distinct spots, they are described as being \"on top of each other.\" The same concept applies to column chromatography, where different compounds ideally elute from the column at different times (in different fractions). If they elute at the same time, they are effectively \"on top of each other\" in the collection tubes.\n\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   **A) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions govern how molecules behave, this is too general. It doesn't specifically explain a separation problem.\n    *   **B) Similar polarities:** The primary principle behind standard chromatography (like using silica gel or alumina) is separation by polarity. Compounds with similar polarities will interact with the stationary phase and mobile phase in a very similar way. This causes them to travel at nearly the same speed during chromatography, resulting in poor or no separation. This directly leads to the situation where they are \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate or in elution fractions. This is the most direct cause of the problem the chemist is describing.\n    *   **C) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for purification by distillation. While a valid reason for a bad day in the lab, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of a spatial overlap seen in chromatography than an issue with separating vapors in distillation.\n    *   **D) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization, not typically for separation. While separating compounds with different optical properties (enantiomers) can be difficult, the underlying separation technique (chiral chromatography) still relies on principles related to differential interaction, which is conceptually closer to polarity-based separation. Furthermore, the issue is the inability to separate, not the optical rotation values themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is standard jargon for a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds in a mixture have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
