    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (DoU = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group given the presence of oxygen.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as per the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 neighbors, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is in the region for protons alpha to a carbonyl group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), consistent with it being the -CH₂- group next to the -CHO proton (2 protons see 1 neighbor, 1+1=2, a doublet). This confirms the presence of a `-CH₂CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring (1,4-disubstituted). The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), suggesting the ring is substituted with at least one electron-donating group.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons which are exchangeable (e.g., with D₂O). This signal, along with the nitrogen in the molecular formula, strongly indicates a primary amino group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) = C₈H(4+2+3)NO = C₈H₉NO. The formula is correct.\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl at low temperature (0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a diazotization reaction. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   4-aminophenylacetaldehyde reacts to form 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride: `[⁺N≡N]C₆H₄CH₂CHO Cl⁻`.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   The addition of water and warming hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This reagent combination signifies a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. The starting material for this step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   **Step 3a (Aldol Addition):** The base (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product.\n        *   Nucleophile (from enolate): `HO-C₆H₄-C⁻H-CHO`\n        *   Electrophile: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C₆H₄-OH`. This is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    *   **Step 3b (Condensation/Dehydration):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The acidic proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) are removed, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   Adduct: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-CH(CHO)(C2)-C₆H₄-OH` (IUPAC numbering for the butanal chain is different, this is for tracking atoms)\n        *   Elimination of H₂O (H⁺ from Cα and OH⁻ from Cβ) gives the condensation product.\n        *   Final Product: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(CHO)-C₆H₄-OH`.\n    *   **Naming the Final Product:** The main chain is a but-2-enal. The substituents are a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 2 and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4. The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The presence of heat ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product, the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, rather than stopping at the aldol adduct. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
