    "1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Conditions**\n    *   The starting material is **5-butylnona-2,6-diene**.\n    *   Let's first draw the structure of this molecule.\n        *   \"nona-\" indicates a 9-carbon parent chain.\n        *   \"2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n        *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n           CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n                                     |\n                                     CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Butyl group)\n        ```\n    *   The reaction condition is **heating**. This suggests a thermally-induced pericyclic reaction.\n    *   Looking at the structure, we can identify a `C=C-C-C-C=C` system, which is a 1,5-diene skeleton. The atoms involved are C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\n    *   Heating a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a **Cope rearrangement**, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement**\n    *   In a Cope rearrangement, the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the hexa-1,5-diene system is broken, and a new sigma bond is formed between atoms 1 and 6. The two pi bonds shift their positions.\n    *   Let's number the atoms of our 1,5-diene system (C2 to C7) for the rearrangement:\n        ```\n          [1]  [2]  [3]   [3'] [2'] [1']\n          C(2)=C(3)-C(4)---C(5)-C(6)=C(7)\n        ```\n    *   The bond that breaks is the C4-C5 sigma bond.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   The pi bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4.\n    *   The pi bond at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule.\n        *   The original C1 (methyl group) is still attached to C2.\n        *   The original C8-C9 (ethyl group) is still attached to C7.\n        *   The butyl group is still attached to C5.\n    *   The new backbone of the rearranged part of the molecule is `C4=C3-C2-C7-C6=C5`.\n    *   Let's attach the substituents to this new backbone:\n        *   A methyl group is on C2.\n        *   An ethyl group is on C7.\n        *   A butyl group is on C5.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n                 CH₃    CH₂CH₃\n                  |      |\n           H₂C=CH -CH----CH-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n           (C4)(C3)(C2)  (C7)(C6)(C5)   (Butyl)\n        ```\n\n4.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n    *   First, we need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the double bonds).\n    *   The chain must contain the `C=C-C-C-C=C` fragment. Let's trace all possible paths to find the longest one.\n    *   Path 1: Start from the C4 end (`H₂C=`) and go through the backbone to the end of the butyl group.\n        `C(4)-C(3)-C(2)-C(7)-C(6)-C(5)-C(1'bu)-C(2'bu)-C(3'bu)-C(4'bu)`\n        The length of this chain is 10 carbons. So, the parent name is **deca-**.\n    *   Next, we number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions).\n        *   Numbering from the right end (from the butyl group): The double bonds would be at positions 5 and 9 (`...-C(5)=C(6)-...-C(9)=C(10)`).\n        *   Numbering from the left end (from the `H₂C=` group): The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5 (`C(1)=C(2)-...-C(5)=C(6)-...`).\n        *   The locant set {1, 5} is lower than {5, 9}, so we must number the chain from the left.\n    *   The parent name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   Finally, we identify and name the substituents on this 10-carbon chain.\n        *   There is a **methyl group** (original C1) on C3 of our new chain. -> **3-methyl**.\n        *   There is an **ethyl group** (original C8-C9) on C4 of our new chain. -> **4-ethyl**.\n    *   Putting it all together (substituents in alphabetical order), the IUPAC name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   B) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   Our derived name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
