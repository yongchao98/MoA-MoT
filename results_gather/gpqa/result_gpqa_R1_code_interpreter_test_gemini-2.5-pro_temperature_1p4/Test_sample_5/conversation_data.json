    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the energy spectrum (the possible energy levels) of a particle of mass 'm' in a two-dimensional potential given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n**2. Simplify the Potential by Changing Coordinates**\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve if the potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of functions of each coordinate independently (e.g., V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)). The given potential is in polar coordinates, but its form suggests that converting to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) might simplify it.\n\nThe standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nLet's substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 k(r²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x)²\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with x²:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**3. Recognize the Form of the Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis is the potential of a two-dimensional **anisotropic harmonic oscillator**. It describes two independent (uncoupled) simple harmonic oscillators: one moving along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.\n\n**4. Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x- and y-motions:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nWe need to find the energy levels for each one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The general formula for the energy levels of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = 1/2 Kq² is:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x².\n    The effective spring constant is K_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    The spring constant is K_y = k.\n    The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k/m).\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_nx and E_ny:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression by factoring out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nHere, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and can take any non-negative integer value (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\nLet's compare this with the provided choices:\n\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option B exactly."
