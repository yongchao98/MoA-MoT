    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical system**\nThe solution is made by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that fully dissociates in water to provide K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-). H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that fully dissociates in water to provide Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-). HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n*   Together, H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-      (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n\nThe ion we are interested in, the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-), is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-      (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each substance and then their concentrations in the 200.00 mL (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **For KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4-):**\n    *   Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (which provides HPO4^2-):**\n    *   Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]**\nThe buffer solution's pH is primarily controlled by the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- equilibrium. We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find [H+].\n\nKa2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\nRearranging for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nSince this is a buffer, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations with the initial concentrations we just calculated.\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * 1.308\n[H+] = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]**\nNow, we use the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation (Ka3) to find [PO4^3-].\n\nKa3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranging for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe use the values we have: Ka3, the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is minimal), and the [H+] we just calculated.\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is approximately 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with a single python script:\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4) / conc_H_plus\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.236e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10^-7 M, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution containing H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and relevant equilibria.**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. These salts fully dissociate in water to produce K+, Na+, dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4-), and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-).\n*   The H2PO4- and HPO4^2- ions form a buffer system. The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻      (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) is produced from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻      (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4⁻):**\n    Moles = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n*   **Initial concentration of H2PO4⁻:**\n    [H2PO4⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4²⁻):**\n    Moles = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n*   **Initial concentration of HPO4²⁻:**\n    [HPO4²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n*   We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka2 equilibrium expression. Using the Ka2 expression is more direct for the next step.\n    Ka2 = ([H⁺][HPO4²⁻]) / [H2PO4⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n*   Assuming the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for a buffer):\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4³⁻].**\n*   We use the Ka3 equilibrium expression, which involves the orthophosphate ion.\n    Ka3 = ([H⁺][PO4³⁻]) / [HPO4²⁻]\n*   Rearranging to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n*   Substitute the known values. We use the calculated [H⁺] and the initial [HPO4²⁻] (since its further dissociation is negligible).\n    [PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options.**\n*   The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   Rounding to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   This matches option A.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of 6.236e-07.\n\n<<<A>>>"
