    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the field observed at a point `r` at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its current position and time, but at an earlier position and an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Define Variables and Relationships:**\n    *   `q`: The point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: The time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time, which is the time at which the field was generated.\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's retarded position to the observation point. `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n3.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the source at `s(tr)` to the observer at `r` is `d/c`. This must be equal to the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   `t - tr = d / c`\n    *   This equation implicitly defines `tr` for a given `r` and `t`.\n\n4.  **Starting Point: The Retarded Potentials:** The general solutions for the potentials in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potentials:\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n    *   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (where `δ³` is the 3D Dirac delta function)\n    *   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V):**\n    *   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   This integral is complicated because the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'| / c` depends on the integration variable `r'`.\n    *   A standard derivation (e.g., in Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") shows that this dependence introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The volume of the source appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion.\n    *   The result of the integration is:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c))]`\n        where `d̂ = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observer. The quantities `d`, `d`, and `v` are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   Let's simplify the denominator:\n        `d * (1 - (d̂ · v)/c) = d * (1 - (d · v)/(d * c)) = d - (d · v)/c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for V:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `V(r, t) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Vector Potential (A):**\n    *   We follow a similar procedure for `A(r, t)`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr) * δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   Since `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time, it is constant with respect to the integration variable `r'` and can be taken out of the integral.\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) ∫ [δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    *   The integral is exactly the same one we encountered for V, but without the `q/ε₀` factor. Its value is `1 / (d - (d · v)/c)`.\n    *   So, `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n    *   Using the simplified denominator from the previous step:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * v / 4π) * [1 / ((cd - d · v) / c)]`\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The derived expressions are:\n        `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n        `A(r, t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n    *   These expressions exactly match option D.\n\n9.  **Checking the Relationship between A and V:**\n    *   It is a known result for Liénard-Wiechert potentials that `A = (v/c²) V`. Let's verify this.\n    *   `(v/c²) V = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))] = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   Now let's simplify our expression for A using the relation `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which means `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    *   `A = ( (1/(ε₀c²)) qc v) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = (qv / (ε₀c)) / (4π (dc - d · v)) = qv / (4πε₀c (dc - d · v))`\n    *   The expressions match, confirming the self-consistency of our results and their relation.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which correspond to option D. The negative sign in the denominator (`dc - d · v`) is crucial and arises from the retardation effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
