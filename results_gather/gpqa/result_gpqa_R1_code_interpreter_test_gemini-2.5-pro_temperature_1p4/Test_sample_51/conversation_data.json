    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem asks for the ratio of atomic energy level populations at different temperatures. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of these levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (n) in two energy levels (a higher energy level 2 and a lower energy level 1) is given by:\n    n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   n₂, n₁ are the number densities of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n    *   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   E₂, E₁ are the energies of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:** We have two scenarios for the star: one without spots and one with spots, each with a different effective temperature. Let's define the population ratio for each case.\n    *   **No Spots:** The temperature is T_nospot = 6000 K. The ratio is:\n        R_nospot = (n₂ / n₁)_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n    *   **With Spots:** The overall effective temperature is T_spot = 5500 K. The ratio is:\n        R_spot = (n₂ / n₁)_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n4.  **Determine the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the ratio of the two ratios:\n    Factor = R_nospot / R_spot\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n    Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength of λ = 1448 Å. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels, ΔE.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h is Planck's constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\n6.  **Combine and Calculate:** Now, substitute the expression for ΔE into the factor equation:\n    Factor = exp[ - (h * c / (k * λ)) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) ]\n\n    We can now plug in the known values to find the numerical answer. The additional information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this calculation, as the relevant effective temperatures are already provided.\n\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T_nospot = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = 5500 K\n\n    A Python script is used for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8     # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nlambda_val = 1448e-10  # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\nT_nospot = 6000       # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spot = 5500         # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# The factor is given by exp[ - (h*c / (k*lambda_val)) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) ]\n\n# Calculate the term hc/(k*lambda)\nterm = (h * c) / (k * lambda_val)\n\n# Calculate the difference in inverse temperatures\ninv_T_diff = (1 / T_nospot) - (1 / T_spot)\n\n# Calculate the exponent\nexponent = -term * inv_T_diff\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<<<\n4.502621746654924\n>>>The calculation shows that the factor is approximately 4.50. This matches option B. The factor is greater than 1, which is consistent with the problem statement that the ratio of populations *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., the ratio is higher when there are no spots).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots).\n\n**1. Underlying Physics: The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nAssuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n₂) to a lower energy level (n₁) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nn₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   n₂, n₁ are the number densities of atoms in the respective energy levels.\n*   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constants for a given transition).\n*   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Calculating the Desired Factor**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures. Let R_nospot be the population ratio at T_nospot = 6000 K, and R_spot be the population ratio at T_spot = 5500 K.\n\n*   R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n*   R_spot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\nThe factor we want to find is F = R_nospot / R_spot:\n\nF = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the exponent rule eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n\nF = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospot) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\nF = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) ]\n\n**3. Finding the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe problem states the transition corresponds to a wavelength λ = 1448 Å. The energy difference ΔE is the energy of a photon with this wavelength, given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the factor F:\n\nF = exp[ (-h * c / (k * λ)) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot) ]\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow we can plug in the values and calculate the factor. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage is extraneous because the relevant effective temperatures are already provided.\n\n*   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   T_nospot = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5500 K\n\nThe calculation performed by the code gives a result of approximately 4.506.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe factor by which the population ratio changes is approximately 4.51. This means the ratio of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower energy level is about 4.5 times larger when the star is hotter (no spots) compared to when it is cooler (with spots). This matches the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~7.8\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~1.1\nD) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated value of ~4.5 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
