    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   Initially (for t < 0), the particle is in a magnetic field **B** = B**k̂** (along the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian is H_initial = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**k̂**) = -γBS_z.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin up, |+z⟩) and -ħ/2 (spin down, |-z⟩).\n    *   The corresponding energies are E_up = -γB(ħ/2) and E_down = +γB(ħ/2).\n    *   The lower energy state (assuming γ > 0) is the spin-up state, |+z⟩. The expectation value of the magnetic moment for this state is ⟨**μ**⟩ = γ⟨**S**⟩ = γ(ħ/2)**k̂**, which is indeed aligned with the field **B** = B**k̂**.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (along the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for t > 0 is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γ**S** ⋅ (B**ĵ**) = -γBS_y.\n    *   Because the change is \"sudden\", the state of the system at t=0⁺ is the same as at t=0⁻. So the system starts evolving from the state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ under the influence of the new Hamiltonian H.\n    *   The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation, which for a time-independent Hamiltonian has the solution:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of μ_z:**\n    *   We want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z(t)⟩.\n    *   ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.\n    *   To calculate this, it's convenient to express the initial state |+z⟩ in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H (which are the eigenstates of S_y).\n    *   The eigenstates of S_y are:\n        *   |+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) with eigenvalue +ħ/2.\n        *   |-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) with eigenvalue -ħ/2.\n    *   By inverting these relations, we can write the initial state |+z⟩ as:\n        |+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩).\n    *   Now, we apply the time evolution operator. The states |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are eigenstates of H = -γBS_y with eigenvalues E_+ = -γB(ħ/2) and E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2) respectively.\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩) ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|-y⟩ ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩ ]\n\n4.  **Find the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   To calculate ⟨S_z(t)⟩, we convert |ψ(t)⟩ back to the S_z basis:\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z⟩ ]\n        Using Euler's formulas, cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2 and sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i):\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + i(2i sin(γBt/2))|-z⟩\n        |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩.\n    *   Now we can compute the expectation value of S_z:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)\n        Since S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩ and S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩, we get:\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = cos²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2) * (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]\n    *   Using the double-angle identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ):\n        ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt).\n    *   Finally, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        ⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt).\n    *   The time dependence of this quantity is given by cos(γBt). A function of the form cos(Ωt) oscillates with an angular frequency Ω.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is Ω = γB. This is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency is γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
