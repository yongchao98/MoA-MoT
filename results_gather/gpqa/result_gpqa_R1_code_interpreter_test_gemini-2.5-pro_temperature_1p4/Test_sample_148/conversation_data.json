    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (¹H NMR):**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton).\n        *   These peaks have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is correct (1H), and their individual integrals are roughly equal, suggesting a ~1:1 mixture of two species.\n        *   The phenomenon is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   **Interpretation:** This means the alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since it's the same proton on the same molecule, this implies the molecule itself exists in two different forms that are stable and interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, averaged, and possibly broadened peak would be observed).\n\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, again supporting a ~1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data is the same for both peaks and matches the expected mass of the target molecule.\n        *   **Interpretation:** The two species are separable by chromatography, meaning they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity). They are isomers because they have the same mass. The fact that the analysis was done at \"elevated temperature\" and still showed two peaks indicates that the two forms are quite stable and the energy barrier to interconversion is significant.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Observations:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product. This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce a single, identical spectrum. You would not see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) LC system, enantiomers co-elute and produce a single peak.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images.\n        *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have different physical properties and different chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks.\n        *   Because their atoms are arranged differently in 3D space, their protons will experience different chemical environments. This would lead to different NMR spectra for each diastereomer, explaining the two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   A common example in peptides is cis/trans isomerism about the amide bond (these isomers are diastereomeric). The rotation around this bond is slow, leading to distinct species on the NMR and LC timescales. This phenomenon is often called atropisomerism, and atropisomers are a class of diastereomers. This option fits all observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid or coupling reagent has been added to the molecule. This would create a new molecule with a different chemical formula and a significantly different (higher) mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data, which shows the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that cohesively accounts for all the evidence—two NMR signals for one proton, two separable peaks by LC, and identical mass for both peaks—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
