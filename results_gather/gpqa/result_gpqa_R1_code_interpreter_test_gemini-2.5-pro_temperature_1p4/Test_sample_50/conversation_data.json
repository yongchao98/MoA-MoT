    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius R. A \"conducting\" sphere means charges are free to move within it.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a vast reservoir of charge (the Earth). Its electric potential is fixed at V = 0.\n    *   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume the charge is outside the sphere, so `d > R`.\n    *   The presence of the charge `q` will cause the mobile charges within the conductor to redistribute themselves on the surface of the sphere. This is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   The goal is to find the net potential energy `U` of this entire system (the charge `q` and the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:**\n    *   This type of problem is most elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The electric field *outside* the sphere is the superposition of the field from the original charge `q` and the field from the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are chosen precisely so that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Through a standard derivation (which involves setting the potential V(r=R) = 0), the properties of the image charge are found to be:\n        *   Position of the image charge (from the center): `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n    *   Note that since `d > R`, the position `b` is less than `R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere. The negative sign of `q'` indicates that if `q` is positive, the induced charge is effectively negative, which makes sense as it's an attractive interaction.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   `U = W_external = ∫_∞^d F_external ⋅ dr`\n    *   The external force required is the negative of the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`, i.e., `F_external = -F_electric`.\n    *   The electric force on `q` at any position `x` (from `∞` to `d`) is due to the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   At a variable position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The electric force is attractive: `F_electric(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`.\n    *   `F_electric(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is a force pointing towards the origin, hence the negative sign if x is along the positive axis).\n    *   The work done *by the electric field* as the charge moves from `∞` to `d` is `W_electric = ∫_∞^d F_electric(x) dx`. The change in potential energy is the negative of this work: `U = -W_electric`.\n    *   `U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Performing the Integration:**\n    *   We can solve the integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    *   The integral becomes: `∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = (1/2) * (-u^-1) = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n    *   Now, we apply the limits to the result of the integration:\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative (and quicker) Method using Energy Formula:**\n    *   The potential energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n    *   In our system, we have the charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`.\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   So, `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced(at q)`.\n    *   The potential from the induced charges is equivalent to the potential from the image charge `q'`.\n    *   `V_induced(at q) = V_image(at q) = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance from `q'` to `q` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `V_induced(at q) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   This confirms the result from the integration method.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final expression for the net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated result matches option D exactly.\n\nSince the problem is purely symbolic, no python code is needed for calculation. The derivation is based on fundamental principles of electrostatics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
