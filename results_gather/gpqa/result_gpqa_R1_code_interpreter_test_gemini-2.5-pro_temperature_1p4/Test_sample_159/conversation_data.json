    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Aperture:** An N-sided polygon.\n    *   **Geometric Constraint:** All apothems have a constant length 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   **Limit:** The number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    *   **Physics:** Monochromatic light (wavelength λ) undergoes far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction through this aperture.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern.\n    *   **Approximation:** Small angles, so `sin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Limiting Shape of the Aperture:**\n    *   A regular polygon with a very large number of sides approaches a circle.\n    *   I need to determine the radius of this limiting circle. The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The distance from the center to a vertex is the circumradius, R.\n    *   For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius R is `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    *   As N approaches infinity (N -> ∞), the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n    *   Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit, `a = R * cos(0) = R`.\n    *   Therefore, an N-sided polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n\n3.  **Translate the Physics Problem:**\n    *   The problem is now simplified to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n    *   The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern.\n\n4.  **Recall the Theory of the Airy Pattern:**\n    *   The intensity `I` of the diffraction pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    *   Where:\n        *   `I₀` is the central intensity.\n        *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n\n5.  **Identify the Minima:**\n    *   Intensity minima (dark fringes) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`.\n    *   We need to find the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The first few zeros are `x = 0, 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, ...`\n    *   The root `x=0` corresponds to the central maximum, not a minimum.\n    *   The first minimum corresponds to the first non-zero root, and the second minimum corresponds to the second non-zero root.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n        `k * a * sin(θ₁) = 3.8317`\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = 3.8317`\n        Using the small angle approximation (`sin(θ₁) ≈ θ₁`):\n        `(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ = 3.8317`\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n        `k * a * sin(θ₂) = 7.0156`\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = 7.0156`\n        Using the small angle approximation (`sin(θ₂) ≈ θ₂`):\n        `(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ = 7.0156`\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ = [(7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n    *   `Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = [3.1839 / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n8.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   To get the final coefficient, I will calculate `3.1839 / (2 * π)`. I'll use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function J1(x). The first non-zero root gives the first minimum.\nfirst_minima_root = 3.8317\nsecond_minima_root = 7.0156\n\n# The angular position theta is given by k*a*sin(theta) = root, where k = 2*pi/lambda.\n# Using small angle approximation sin(theta) ~ theta:\n# (2*pi/lambda) * a * theta = root\n# theta = (root / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Calculate the angular positions\ntheta_1_coeff = first_minima_root / (2 * np.pi)\ntheta_2_coeff = second_minima_root / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima\ndelta_theta_coeff = theta_2_coeff - theta_1_coeff\n\nprint(f\"{delta_theta_coeff:.3f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a very large number of sides (N -> ∞) and a constant apothem 'a' approaches the shape of a circle.\nIn the limit as N -> ∞, the apothem 'a' becomes equal to the radius of the circle. This is because for a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the circumradius R and the apothem a is `a = R * cos(π/N)`. As N approaches infinity, `π/N` approaches 0, and `cos(0) = 1`, so `a = R`.\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`.

The Python code provided in the thought process performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First non-zero root of the Bessel function J1(x)\nfirst_minima_root = 3.8317\n# Second non-zero root of the Bessel function J1(x)\nsecond_minima_root = 7.0156\n\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (root_n / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# We want to find the angular distance delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\ndelta_theta_coefficient = (second_minima_root - first_minima_root) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{delta_theta_coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\nThe output `0.507` is the coefficient for `(λ / a)`. This value is closest to option B. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the Bessel function roots. Using more precise values would yield a result even closer to 0.506. For example, using `x1=3.831706` and `x2=7.015587` gives `(7.015587 - 3.831706) / (2*pi) ≈ 0.5067`.\n\nThus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.506 * λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
