    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Determine the Structure of Compound X**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   A strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons meta to the carboxylic acid group (and ortho to the other substituent).\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** Let's assemble the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methyl group and another group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield, is characteristic of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring). This is the methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   The CH group (2.9 ppm) is attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   This CH is also attached to a CH₃ group (1.4 ppm), explaining the doublet at 1.4 ppm.\n        *   This CH is also attached to a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm).\n        *   The CH₂ group (1.7 ppm) is attached to the terminal CH₃ group (0.9 ppm), explaining the triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n        *   The complete alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Combining all the pieces, Compound X has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para (1,4) positions on a benzene ring. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It is particularly effective at the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product**\n\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The benzene ring and the stable sec-butyl alkyl group will not be affected by these reaction conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The product will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n**4. Matching with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not retained.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl. No rearrangement occurs.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
