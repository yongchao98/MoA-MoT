    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFx, where x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of A2 is M(Y) + x * M(F).\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)  (Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` and a corresponding element Y that has a molar mass close to the calculated M(Y). We can test integer values for x:\n*   x=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca or Sc)\n*   x=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br or Se)\n*   x=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb)\n*   x=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy)\n*   x=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg or Bi)\n*   x=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu or Am)\n\nTo determine the correct element, we use the other clues.\n\"A1 is a bright-red substance... decomposes at 293 K... oxidizes xenon.\"\nThis points to a very reactive, high-oxidation-state fluoride of a heavy element. The actinides, like plutonium (Pu), are known for such compounds. Let's test Y = Pu (M ≈ 244 g/mol).\nIf M(Y) = 244, then 244 ≈ 40.45 * x, which gives x ≈ 6.03. This is very close to x=6.\nSo, let's hypothesize that **A2 is PuF6**.\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for PuF6: M(Pu) = 244 g/mol, M(F) = 19 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 = 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.4%. This is a very strong match.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds A1, A3, A4, and A5 using Plutonium Chemistry**\n\n*   **Compound A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is A1 -> PuF6 + F2.\n    For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of plutonium, such as PuF8. However, PuF8 is unknown and extremely unlikely to exist. This indicates a contradiction. Let's re-read carefully. Perhaps the roles of A1 and A2 are reversed from our initial assumption based on the properties.\n\n*   Let's re-evaluate based on chemical properties.\n    *   **PuF6** is described as a volatile, reddish-brown solid. This fits \"bright-red substance\".\n    *   **PuF6** is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and decomposes.\n    *   The decomposition of PuF6 is: **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    *   **PuF6** is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can oxidize xenon.\n\n    This means **A1 must be PuF6**.\n    The decomposition reaction is A1 -> A2 + F2, which translates to **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    Therefore, **A2 must be PuF4**.\n\n    Now, we must address the mass percentage discrepancy. The problem states ɷF for A2 is 31.96%. We calculated that for **PuF6**, not PuF4.\n    ɷF(PuF4) = (4 * 19) / (244 + 4*19) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%.\n    This is a significant contradiction. It appears there is an error in the problem statement itself, where the mass percentage given (31.96%) actually corresponds to substance A1 (PuF6), not A2 (PuF4). Given that all other chemical descriptions for Pu chemistry fit perfectly, we proceed by assuming this error in the problem's text.\n\n*   **Summary of corrected identification:**\n    *   Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n    *   A1 = PuF6 (reddish-brown, decomposes at RT, oxidizes Xe)\n    *   A2 = PuF4 (product of A1 decomposition)\n\n*   **Compound A3**: \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is Pu + nF2 -> A3. PuF6 (A1) is a strong oxidizer. PuF4 (A2) is much more stable. PuF6 is made by fluorinating PuF4 at high temperatures, which is in turn made by fluorinating Pu. Direct fluorination of Pu can also yield PuF6. So, it is plausible that **A3 is PuF6** (same as A1).\n\n*   **Compounds A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes...\"\n    The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5, so **Pu + A4 -> A5**.\n    The five known binary fluorides of Plutonium are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6 (with PuF5 being unstable). PuF3 is the most reduced common fluoride.\n    This reaction (adding the metal Y to one of its fluorides A4) is a synproportionation reaction, where the metal reduces the fluoride to a lower oxidation state.\n    Let's test the possibilities for A4, which must be a stable fluoride higher than A5. A4 solution is also \"colorless\". Pu(III) salts are violet, Pu(IV) are brown/green, Pu(V) are pink, Pu(VI) are pink/orange. However, these are for aqueous solutions. In a non-aqueous solvent like anhydrous HF, fluoride complexes can have different colors. UF4 (analogous to PuF4) is green but can form colorless complexes. Let's assume a plausible reaction from known plutonium chemistry.\n    A well-known synproportionation is the reaction of plutonium metal with plutonium tetrafluoride to produce plutonium trifluoride:\n    **Pu + 3 PuF4 -> 4 PuF3**\n    The problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, not 1:3. Let's check another reaction:\n    **Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4** (This is not 1:1 forming a single product A5)\n    The most likely intended reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry for producing a single product is:\n    **Pu + 2PuF3 -> 3PuF2** (not 1:1)\n    However, the reaction between Pu and PuF4 to make PuF3 is fundamental. Perhaps the stoichiometry in the problem is simplified. Let's assume the most common species are involved. A reaction where a higher fluoride is reduced by the metal.\n    The most logical choice for this process is the reduction of PuF4 (A4) to PuF3 (A5).\n    So, let's identify:\n    *   **A4 = PuF4**\n    *   **A5 = PuF3**\n    The reaction is Pu + 3PuF4 → 4PuF3. While not 1:1, it's a known reaction to produce A5 from A4 and Y. Let's assume the problem's stoichiometry is a simplification and the chemical identity is key.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deductions, substance A4 is Plutonium Tetrafluoride (PuF4).\nWe calculate its molecular weight:\nM(PuF4) = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nM(PuF4) = 244 g/mol + 4 * 19 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 244 + 76\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nOur calculated molecular weight is 320 g/mol. None of the given ranges contain this value. This indicates a potential second error in the problem, either in the options provided or in our identification.\n\nLet's re-examine the last reaction step.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nIf A4 were PuF6, then Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuFx. No single product.\nIf A4 were PuF3, what would it react with Pu to form? A lower fluoride? PuF2 is not a stable bulk compound.\nThis part of the problem is puzzling. Let's reconsider the whole chain.\n\nIs there any other element that fits? We found no other element that fits the mass percentage of A2 and the chemical properties of A1 as well as Plutonium. The logical contradiction must lie within the problem's statements.\n\nLet's assume our identification of **Y=Pu** and **A1=PuF6 -> A2=PuF4** is correct based on the strongest clues (color, reactivity, decomposition), and that the mass % for A2 was a typo for A1. This is the most consistent path.\n\nThis leaves the final reaction step and the final answer.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nLet's consider that the problem might be from a specific educational context where certain facts are canonical, even if unusual.\nWhat if A4 is not PuF4? Let's reconsider.\nA1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6, A5=PuF3. What is A4?\n\"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 must be one of the 5 binary fluorides. Let's assume they are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6 and some other.\nIf A4=PuF6, Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4. This is a possibility if A5 is PuF4, but A2 is already PuF4.\nIf the five compounds are A1-A5, and A1=A3=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A5=PuF3. Then A4 is the only one left.\nBut we don't know the fifth fluoride.\n\nLet's rethink A4 -> A5 from a different angle.\nWhat if Y=Sb?\nA2=SbF3 (ɷF=31.88%). A1->SbF3+F2, so A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is not red. This path fails early.\n\nLet's stick with Pu being the most likely element despite the contradictions. The error seems to be in the problem's data (mass%, stoichiometry, or final options). Let's search for the molecular weight of any of the identified Pu fluorides in the options.\nM(PuF6) = 358 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\nM(PuF3) = 301 g/mol\nNone of these fit in any range.\n\nThere must be another interpretation. Let's go back to the list of candidates from the mass percentage of A2.\nA2 = AuF5 (ɷF=32.53%)? Y=Au. A1=AuF7? No. A1 could be the red dimer [AuF5]2. But it decomposes to monomeric AuF5, not A2+F2. This path is weak.\nA2 = UF6 (ɷF=32.38%)? Y=U. A1 would be UFx (>6), which doesn't exist. This path is weak.\n\nLet's reconsider the decomposition A1 -> A2 + F2 and the red color. This combination is rare. Besides PuF6, KrF4 is a possibility. Let's assume Y=Kr.\nA2 = KrF2 (ɷF=31.2%). This is a bit far from 31.96%.\nIf A2=KrF2, then A1=KrF4. A1 is reddish and decomposes to A2+F2. This fits. A1 and A3 (KrF2?) oxidize Xe. Fits.\nNow the final step: Y + A4 -> A5.\nKr + A4 -> A5.\nKrypton, a noble gas, reacting with one of its own fluorides in a synproportionation reaction is extremely unlikely. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem entirely. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" is the key?\nRed binary fluorides: Au2F10, V F5, PuF6, NpF6.\nThe most likely scenario remains an error in the problem. However, a choice must be made. Let's assume there is a non-obvious element that fits. Let's re-examine the M(Y) list.\n\nx=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8. Element Dy (162.5). Could A2=DyF4? Dy is a lanthanide, typically forming +3 ions. DyF4 exists but is not common. Let's calculate ɷF(DyF4) = (4*19)/(162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 31.86%. This is an excellent match to 31.96%!\nSo let's proceed with Y=Dy and A2=DyF4.\n*   Y = Dysprosium (Dy)\n*   A2 = DyF4 (ɷF=31.86%)\n*   A1: Decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 = DyF5? Not known. Is DyF4 \"bright-red\"? No available information suggests this. Can it oxidize Xe? Highly unlikely for a lanthanide fluoride. This path fails on the chemical properties.\n\nLet's take a step back and assume there's a simple answer we missed, likely due to a faulty premise. The Pu hypothesis is chemically the most sound, but leads to a numeric mismatch with the options. If we are forced to choose an answer, there must be a flaw in our identification of A4.\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 isn't a simple fluoride, but a complex in solution? No, \"binary compounds\".\nWhat if A4 is from a completely different element system? No, it's one of the five fluorides of Y.\n\nLet's assume the molecular weight of *one of the compounds* A1-A5 must fit an answer.\nA1=PuF6 (358)\nA2=PuF4 (320)\nA3=PuF6 (358)\nA4=?\nA5=PuF3 (301)\nNone fit. This indicates Y is not Pu, or the options are for another element.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nA1 -> SbF3 + F2. Thus A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is colorless, not red. This is a fatal flaw.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. Sb + A4 -> A5. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\n2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. This is a known reaction. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\nSo we have:\nY=Sb\nA1=SbF5 (color mismatch)\nA2=SbF3\nA3=SbF5 (obtained by F2 on Sb, oxidizes Xe through formation of adducts like [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-)\nA4=SbF5\nA5=SbF3\nThe only inconsistency is the color of A1. If we ignore that one word, everything else fits. What is the molecular weight of A4?\nA4 = SbF5.\nM(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit in any of the ranges.\n\nThere is a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement as written. No single element satisfies all conditions simultaneously. However, in such cases, one must find the 'least wrong' answer.\nThe match between A2 and DyF4 on mass % is nearly perfect. Let's revisit that.\nY=Dy, A2=DyF4. Let's assume the other chemical facts are \"bent\" to fit.\nWhat would A4 be? Dysprosium chemistry is dominated by DyF3. The reduction of DyF4 by Dy metal would produce DyF3.\nSo, A4=DyF4, A5=DyF3.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. A4 = DyF4.\nMW(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4*19 = 162.5 + 76 = 238.5 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range D) 220-240.\nLet's check if this path is plausible.\nA1->DyF4+F2 implies A1=DyF5 (hypothetical). Assume it's red and oxidizes Xe.\nA3 also oxidizes Xe. A3=DyF4? Unlikely.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Dy + DyF4 -> DyF3? No, Dy + 3DyF4 -> 4DyF3.\nThis path is also full of holes.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible chemical story (Pu) and assume the options are wrong.\nLet's assume the identification of A4 is wrong, but Y is still Pu. Could A4 be something else with MW in a given range?\nRange D is 220-240. PuFx cannot have this MW.\nLet's assume Y is wrong, and work backwards from the answer.\nIf answer D is correct, MW(A4) is between 220-240. We found MW(DyF4)=238.5. This is the only candidate whose fluoride (A4) fits an answer range, and whose *other* fluoride (A2) perfectly matches the given mass percent. The problem's author likely constructed it around Dy, even though the chemical properties (red color, Xe oxidation) are unrealistic for Dysprosium and were probably borrowed from other elements to make the problem more challenging. Therefore, the intended answer path is likely:\n1. Use ɷF = 31.96% to find A2. This leads to M(Y)≈40.45x. For x=4, M(Y)≈161.8, which points to Dy. ɷF(DyF4)=31.86%, a near-perfect match. So A2=DyF4.\n2. The reaction Y+A4->A5 is a reduction of a higher fluoride by the metal. The common fluorides are DyF3 and DyF4. This suggests A4=DyF4 being reduced to A5=DyF3.\n3. The question asks for MW of A4. Calculate MW(DyF4). MW = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n4. This value falls into the range 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>"
