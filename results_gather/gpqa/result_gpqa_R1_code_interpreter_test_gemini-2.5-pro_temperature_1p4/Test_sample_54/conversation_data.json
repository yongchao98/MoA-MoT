    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Fragments**\n\nFirst, let's analyze each signal from the 1H NMR data to understand the different proton environments in the molecule.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal for 3 protons appearing as a singlet (s) suggests a methyl group (CH₃) that is not adjacent to any other protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (CH₃-C(=O)O-). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is expected.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A signal for 3 protons appearing as a doublet (d) indicates a methyl group (CH₃) that is adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond, like in a `-CH=CH-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A signal for 1 proton appearing as a doublet of quartets (dq) indicates a proton on a double bond (-CH=). The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one other proton, and the \"quartet\" part means it's also coupled to an adjacent group of three equivalent protons (a CH₃ group). This perfectly matches a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH₃` fragment, specifically the one next to the methyl group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A signal for 1 proton appearing as a doublet (d) indicates a proton on a double bond (-CH=) that is coupled to only one other proton. The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) suggests this proton is on a carbon atom attached to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n\nLet's sum the number of protons from the integration values: 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = 8 protons. Now let's check the proton count of the possible molecules:\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃): The total number of protons is 3 (acetate) + 1 (alkene) + 1 (alkene) + 3 (alkene methyl) = 8 protons. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃): The total number of protons would be 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key piece of information to distinguish them is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons (the ones on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a measured coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   Coupling constants for vinylic protons are highly dependent on their geometric relationship:\n    *   **Trans** protons (on opposite sides of the double bond) have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** protons (on the same side of the double bond) have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed J-value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This allows us to eliminate the cis isomer.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the proton count, the fragments identified, the splitting patterns, and particularly the large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃(d)-COO-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c)) is:\n*   H(a): 7.0 ppm (d, J=16.0 Hz)\n*   H(b): 5.5 ppm (dq)\n*   H(c): 1.6 ppm (d)\n*   H(d): 2.1 ppm (s)\n\nThis is a perfect match for all the provided data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
