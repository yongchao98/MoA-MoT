    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution where a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring directs the position of the incoming bromine.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n3. Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n4. Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n5. Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n6. Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\nThe \"weight fraction of the yield\" is proportional to the percentage of the para-isomer formed in the product mixture. We need to rank the substances from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe must first classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This is the most crucial factor determining the product distribution.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating groups) or halogens (deactivating but o,p-directing).\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, o,p-director.\n    These three substances will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating groups).\n    *   **-NO2 (4, Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (2, Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   **-COOH (6, Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, m-director.\n    These three substances will produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the para-isomer.\n\n**3. Initial Grouping**\n\nBased on the classification, we can form two groups. The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while those with ortho, para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\nLowest para-yields: {2, 4, 6}\nHighest para-yields: {1, 3, 5}\n\nSo, the final correct order must be of the form: {order of 2, 4, 6} < {order of 1, 3, 5}.\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors {2, 4, 6}**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is always very low. The relative amount of para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving an even smaller fraction for the ortho and para positions.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   -NO2 is the strongest deactivating group due to powerful inductive and resonance electron withdrawal.\n*   -COOH and -COOC2H5 are also strongly deactivating. Comparing them, the -C2H5 group in the ester is weakly electron-donating compared to the -H in the carboxylic acid, making the -COOC2H5 group slightly *less* deactivating than the -COOH group.\n*   Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nPara-isomer yield: (-NO2) < (-COOH) < (-COOC2H5)\nWhich corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors {1, 3, 5}**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This ratio is governed by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** Bulkier substituents block the ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Bulkiness order: -C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl. This factor alone would suggest a para-yield order of 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Reactivity-Selectivity Principle:** Less reactive substrates are generally more selective. The activating groups (-CH3, -C2H5) make the ring very reactive, leading to a faster reaction that is less selective. The deactivating -Cl group makes the ring less reactive, leading to a slower, more selective reaction that favors the thermodynamically more stable para-product.\n    *   Reactivity: {1, 5} > 3.\n    *   This implies that chlorobenzene (3) should be the most selective for the para position among the three. So, the para-yield for 3 is the highest.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both are activated. The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, so ethylbenzene should have a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene. Para-yield: 1 < 5.\n\nCombining these points gives the following order for para-yield: **1 < 5 < 3**. This order is consistent with experimental data from reliable sources like March's Advanced Organic Chemistry for bromination (Para% yields: Toluene ≈ 62%, Ethylbenzene ≈ 63%, Chlorobenzene ≈ 89%).\n\n**6. Final Arrangement**\n\nNow we combine the orders for the two groups:\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nPutting them together, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
