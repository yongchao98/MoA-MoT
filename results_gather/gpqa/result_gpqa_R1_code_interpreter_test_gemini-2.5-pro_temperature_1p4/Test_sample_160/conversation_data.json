    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is described by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   The sample compartment has a constant volume, temperature, and pressure (< 10⁻⁹ Torr). This means the number density (`n`) of the residual gas molecules is constant in both scenarios.\n    *   Therefore, the difference between λ₁ and λ₂ must come from a difference in their respective collision cross-sections (σ₁ and σ₂).\n\n3.  **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ₁)**\n    *   In this case, we are considering a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter `d`. A collision occurs if the center of one molecule comes within a distance `d` of the center of another. This means the effective target area, or collision cross-section (σ₁), is a circle of radius `d`.\n    *   σ₁ = π * d²\n    *   A more precise formula for the mean free path of a gas also includes a factor of √2 to account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ₂)**\n    *   In this case, we are considering a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule.\n    *   An electron is, for all practical purposes in this context, a point particle. It is vastly smaller than a gas molecule.\n    *   The target is the gas molecule, which we've modeled as a sphere of diameter `d` (and radius `d/2`). The \"target area\" it presents to a point-like electron is its own geometric cross-section.\n    *   σ₂ = π * (radius)² = π * (d/2)² = π * d² / 4\n    *   Since the electrons are moving at extremely high (relativistic) speeds and the gas molecules are comparatively stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂) = 1 / (n * π * d² / 4) = 4 / (n * π * d²)\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n    λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n    So, according to the hard-sphere model, λ₂ is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ₁.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Our calculation shows that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁. Let's check which option this result fits.\n    *   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This is false. Our result (λ₂ ≈ 5.66λ₁) is not less than 1.22λ₁.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁: This is false.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This is true. Our result (λ₂ ≈ 5.66λ₁) is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22λ₁. This option correctly captures that the electron's mean free path is substantially longer than the gas molecule's mean free path.\n    *   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fundamental reason for the difference between λ₁ and λ₂ is the difference in the collision cross-section. The effective target area for a gas molecule colliding with another molecule (σ₁) is significantly larger than the target area for a much smaller electron colliding with a gas molecule (σ₂). Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), the smaller cross-section for electron scattering results in a much longer mean free path. Our calculation shows λ₂ ≈ 5.66λ₁, which strongly supports the conclusion that λ₂ is substantially larger than λ₁.\n\n<<<C>>>"
