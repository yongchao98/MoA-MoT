    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two isomers (tautomers) are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to undergo keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), meaning they are sp²-hybridized. They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but for the typical keto-enol tautomerism, a proton is removed from an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon. The potential product of a proton rearrangement would be hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), but its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₂, which is different from benzoquinone's (C₆H₄O₂). The interconversion between benzoquinone and hydroquinone is a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction, not tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks the necessary sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogens, it does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between two carbonyl groups. These are sp³-hybridized.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (at positions 2, 4, and 6) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). Phloroglucinol is an aromatic compound and is therefore exceptionally stable. The equilibrium overwhelmingly favors the aromatic enol form. The molecular formula of phloroglucinol is also C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, A = benzoquinone.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule is relatively flat. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it cannot have a non-superimposable mirror image and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
