    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n*   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This suggests using simplified integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), which is common in such problems.\n*   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description and the formula CnH2n (for n=6). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   One of the components of Y is Z itself. Let's call the components C and D. So, C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. This means D must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   D does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that D is either saturated or aromatic. Since it can be hydrogenated, it cannot be saturated (as it would be cyclohexane itself or an isomer that would not typically hydrogenate further under these conditions). Therefore, D must be an aromatic compound.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a Lewis acid catalyst) and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a Pt catalyst).\n*   Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   When X is heated with platinum, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   The reaction is: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the identified components of Y: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n*   This reaction represents a hydrogen transfer, which is a type of disproportionation. One molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced). For the reactants and products to be equimolar, the stoichiometry must be 1:1 → 1:1.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total H atoms in (A + B) = Total H atoms in (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 5: Consistency Check**\n\n*   Let's check if plausible structures for A and B exist that fit all conditions.\n*   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. The total hydrogen count for A+B is 18. Both A and B must be C6 compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   A plausible pair is A = cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total number of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Mixture X must decolorize bromine water. Both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene have C=C bonds and will do so.\n*   There should be no conjugated multiple bonds in X. If we choose B to be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, its two double bonds are not conjugated. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is met.\n*   Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) gives only cyclohexane. This is also correct.\n*   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning is based on chemical principles and does not require complex computation.\n# However, we can use a script to confirm the initial deduction about the formula of Z\n# and the final answer based on the identified products.\n\n# --- Z identification based on H content ---\n# Using integer masses (C=12, H=1) as implied by 14.28% (~1/7)\nH_mass = 1\nC_mass = 12\n# For a cycloalkane CnH2n, the H fraction is (2n * H_mass) / (n * C_mass + 2n * H_mass)\n# = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7\nh_fraction = 1/7\nh_percentage = h_fraction * 100\n# print(f\"H percentage for any CnH2n cycloalkane: {h_percentage:.2f}%\") -> This would be 14.29%\n\n# --- Y identification ---\n# Component C = Cyclohexane (C6H12) -> 12 Hydrogens\n# Component D = Benzene (C6H6) -> 6 Hydrogens\nh_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\nh_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n# --- Calculation for X ---\n# By atom conservation in the reaction A + B -> C + D\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n\nprint(total_h_atoms_in_X)\n```\n\n>>> B",
    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll break down the information into key facts about substances X, Y, and Z.\n\n    *   **Substance Z:**\n        *   It's a hydrocarbon.\n        *   Mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n        *   It's the sole product of hydrogenating mixtures X and Y under severe conditions.\n        *   It does not react further with hydrogen (i.e., it's a saturated hydrocarbon).\n        *   It's a component of mixture Y.\n        *   It's a widely used solvent.\n\n    *   **Mixture Y:**\n        *   An equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n        *   One liquid is Z.\n        *   It does not decolorize bromine water (meaning its components are saturated or aromatic).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n\n    *   **Mixture X:**\n        *   An equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n        *   It decolorizes bromine water (meaning at least one component has C=C or C≡C bonds, i.e., is unsaturated).\n        *   Its components have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   Heating X with platinum (Pt) catalyst causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\n\n    *   **The Goal:** Find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each component added together).\n\n2.  **Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The most critical piece of information is the mass percentage of hydrogen: 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 0.1428. This value is suspiciously close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This is a common clue in chemistry problems.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * M_H) / (x * M_C + y * M_H)`, where M are the atomic masses. Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7y = 12x + y`.\n    *   Simplifying this equation: `6y = 12x`, which reduces to `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react with more hydrogen. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   It is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This fits all the criteria.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Identify Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call the components C and D, so C = C6H12.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated, so it doesn't. The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water, which means it is either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenating D must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, D must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it wouldn't typically be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, D must be an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. The only option is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's check: Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water (it requires a catalyst like FeBr3) and it can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature, Pt catalyst) to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Answer.**\n    *   The problem states that mixture X turns into mixture Y upon heating with platinum:\n        `Mixture X → Mixture Y`\n    *   Since both are equimolar mixtures of two components, we can write the reaction as:\n        `Liquid A + Liquid B → Liquid C + Liquid D`\n        `Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   This is described as a disproportionation, which is a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (hydrogenation/dehydrogenation), one species gains hydrogen (is reduced) and another loses hydrogen (is oxidized). The reactants A and B must be C6 hydrocarbons since they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   The most important principle here is the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane + one molecule of benzene).\n    *   Total H atoms in X = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Final Consistency Check (Optional but good practice).**\n    *   Can we find plausible molecules A and B for mixture X?\n    *   They must both be C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   They must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   The sum of their hydrogens must be 18.\n    *   A good candidate pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   `H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18`. (Checks out)\n        *   Both have C=C bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Checks out)\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. (Checks out)\n        *   Both can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. (Checks out)\n        *   The overall transformation is plausible as a catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\nThe logic holds up perfectly. The core calculation is based on identifying the products (Y) and applying the conservation of atoms.\n\nNow I'll use a Python script to formalize the calculation.\n```python\n# Identify the components of mixture Y\n# Component 1 is Cyclohexane (C6H12)\nhydrogen_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\n\n# Component 2 is Benzene (C6H6)\nhydrogen_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n# The problem states that an equimolar mixture X (A+B) reacts to form an equimolar mixture Y (C+D).\n# By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants\n# must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n# Total H atoms in (A + B) = Total H atoms in (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms_in_mixture_X = hydrogen_atoms_in_cyclohexane + hydrogen_atoms_in_benzene\n\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms_in_mixture_X)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture X of two liquids is treated with platinum when heated to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This is a disproportionation reaction.
