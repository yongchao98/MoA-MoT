    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a tricyclic cage structure.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This strong absorbance is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. Assuming the adamantane carbon skeleton (C₁₀) is intact, and incorporating one oxygen atom, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The presence of a C=O group is consistent with this.\n    *   The most significant clue in the ¹H NMR is the signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)**. This chemical shift is in the vinyl proton region, indicating a C=C double bond. The fact that two protons give a single signal suggests they are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry. An exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) on a molecule with a plane of symmetry would fit this description perfectly.\n*   **Structure Determination:** A standard adamantane or protoadamantane skeleton with a ketone does not have vinyl protons. The combination of a C₁₀ skeleton, a ketone, and an exocyclic methylene group that fits the C₁₀H₁₄O formula and the required symmetry points to a rearranged bicyclic structure. The structure consistent with all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This compound is a known, albeit non-obvious, product of the reaction between 1,3-dihaloadamantanes and base, formed via a complex skeletal rearrangement. The plane of symmetry passes through the C=O group and the C=CH₂ group, making the two vinyl protons equivalent.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-i-Pr)₃).\n*   **Reagent Function:** This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, a chemoselective method for reducing ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C-3 of 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagent Function:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup (using DMS). This sequence cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes).\n*   **Analysis:** The C=C bond in Product 2 is the exocyclic methylene group (C=CH₂). Cleavage of this bond will replace the =CH₂ at C-7 with a carbonyl group (=O), while the CH₂ part becomes formaldehyde (which is not part of the main product). The alcohol group at C-3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C3, C9, and C7.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule containing alcohol and ketone functional groups, the most deshielded proton (excluding the exchangeable O-H proton) is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton). In this case, it is the proton at C-3 (H-3). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly downfield from other aliphatic protons (which are typically < 3.0 ppm, even when alpha to a ketone).\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H-3:** To determine the multiplicity (coupling pattern) of H-3, we must identify its neighboring protons. H-3 is on carbon C-3. The adjacent carbons are C-2 and C-4.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C-2 and C-4) is a CH₂ group, so H-3 has a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C-2 are magnetically equivalent to the two protons on C-4. However, within the CH₂ group at C-2, the two protons (one \"exo\" and one \"endo\" relative to the bicyclic system) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. The same applies to C-4.\n    *   The symmetry plane dictates that the C-2 exo proton is equivalent to the C-4 exo proton. Let's call this set of two protons H_exo.\n    *   Similarly, the C-2 endo proton is equivalent to the C-4 endo proton. Let's call this set of two protons H_endo.\n    *   Therefore, H-3 is coupled to two distinct sets of equivalent protons:\n        1.  A set of two equivalent H_exo protons with a coupling constant J(H3, H_exo).\n        2.  A set of two equivalent H_endo protons with a coupling constant J(H3, H_endo).\n    *   In a rigid cyclic system, the dihedral angles between H-3 and H_exo are different from the angles between H-3 and H_endo. According to the Karplus relationship, this means the coupling constants will be different (J(H3, H_exo) ≠ J(H3, H_endo)).\n    *   Coupling to the first set of two equivalent protons (H_exo) splits the H-3 signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the second set of two equivalent protons (H_endo) into another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
