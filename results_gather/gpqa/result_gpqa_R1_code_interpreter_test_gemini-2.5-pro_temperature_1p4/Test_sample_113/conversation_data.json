    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   The reactant is butan-2-one, a ketone (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   It reacts with the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN. The CN⁻ is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   This nucleophilic attack breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). H₃O⁺ represents an acidic medium or acidic workup which provides the necessary protons.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out in either strong acidic or strong basic conditions with heating.\n    *   The options for reagent 'B' are a strong acid (HCl) or a weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically performed using a strong acid like aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄, or a strong base like aqueous NaOH, followed by acidification.\n    *   A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze this reaction to completion.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent 'B' from the given choices is the strong acid **HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is H₃O⁺ and reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
