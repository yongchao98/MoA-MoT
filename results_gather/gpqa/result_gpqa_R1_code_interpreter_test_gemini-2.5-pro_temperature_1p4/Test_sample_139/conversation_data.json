    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   277 K is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n*   Therefore, substance B is heavy water, **D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identify the Heavy Isotope in Substance X**\nSince B (D₂O) is derived from substance G, which in turn comes from the reaction of X and Y, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of substance X must be **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n**3. Deduce the Identity of Gas W and Liquid Y**\n*   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to release gas W. Gas W's molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Let's check common simple molecules:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n    *   D₂: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). (Yes)\n    *   CH₄: 10 protons, 6 neutrons. (No)\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but requires a nitrogen source)\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but requires a carbon source)\n*   Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most logical conclusion.\n*   The reaction is `X + Y -> D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n*   For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, the deuterium atoms must come from X (which is a deuteride, a compound containing D⁻ ions or covalently bonded D). If liquid Y contained normal hydrogen (like in H₂O), the resulting gas would likely be a mixture of D₂, HD, and H₂, or predominantly HD.\n*   To ensure the product is pure D₂, Y must either be non-protic or be a deuterated liquid itself. The most common and logical choice for a liquid that reacts with a deuteride to form a deuteroxide (G, see below) is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   Therefore, **Y = D₂O**.\n\n**4. Deduce the Identity of Precipitate G**\n*   G is a precipitate formed in the reaction `X + D₂O -> D₂ + G`.\n*   G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide (a deuteroxide) decomposing: `M(OD)n --heat--> Metal Oxide + D₂O`.\n*   So, G is a **metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n**, that is insoluble in D₂O.\n\n**5. Identify Substance X**\nWe are looking for a substance X which is a metal deuteride, a common reagent in organic chemistry, and forms an insoluble deuteroxide precipitate upon reaction with D₂O.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂)**\n    *   Analog CaH₂ is used as a drying agent.\n    *   Reaction: `CaD₂(s) + 2D₂O(l) -> Ca(OD)₂(s) + 2D₂(g)`. `Ca(OD)₂` would be sparingly soluble, forming a precipitate (G). Heating `Ca(OD)₂` gives `CaO + D₂O` (B). This fits.\n    *   Reaction with a keto acid (R-CO-COOH): Keto acids have 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like CaD₂ will reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH, after workup). This product has 2 oxygen atoms. This also fits.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**\n    *   Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄(s) + 4D₂O(l) -> LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`.\n    *   Aluminum deuteroxide, `Al(OD)₃`, is the deuterated form of aluminum hydroxide, `Al(OH)₃`, which is a well-known gelatinous precipitate (G). `LiOD` would remain in solution.\n    *   Heating G (`Al(OD)₃`) gives `Al₂O₃ + D₂O` (B). This fits.\n    *   Reaction with a keto acid: LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent and would also reduce the keto acid to a diol with 2 oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\nBoth candidates are plausible. We must use the final calculation to distinguish them.\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\nThe question asks to: \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nThis phrasing implies we should:\n1.  Identify the elements in substance X.\n2.  Determine which of these elements is the lightest (by atomic number) and which is the heaviest (by atomic number).\n3.  Sum the masses of *all atoms* of these two specific elements as they appear in the molecular formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved (D = ²H, mass number = 2; Al = ²⁷Al, mass number = 27; Ca = ⁴⁰Ca, mass number = 40).\n\n*   **If X = CaD₂:**\n    *   Elements are Calcium (Ca, Z=20) and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   Lightest element is H. Heaviest element is Ca.\n    *   There are no other elements, so we sum the masses of all atoms: Mass(Ca) + 2 * Mass(D).\n    *   Calculation: 40 + 2 * 2 = 44. This is not among the options.\n\n*   **If X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   Elements are Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminum (Al, Z=13).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The element Lithium (Li) is ignored as it is neither the lightest nor the heaviest.\n    *   The calculation is the sum of the masses of the aluminum atom and the four deuterium atoms.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(Al) + 4 * Mass(D) = 27 + 4 * 2 = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\nThis value matches option B. Therefore, Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process identified substance X as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Hydrogen (H), Lithium (Li), and Aluminum (Al).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# The molecule contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D) and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n# We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D (²H) has a mass number of 2. Aluminum (²⁷Al) has a mass number of 27.\n\nmass_of_aluminum_atoms = 1 * 27\nmass_of_hydrogen_atoms = 4 * 2\n\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_aluminum_atoms + mass_of_hydrogen_atoms\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B**\n    *   The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D or ²H), is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match.\n    *   Therefore, substance B is **D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Nature of Substance X and the Reaction**\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is a product, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of substance X must be **Deuterium (D)**. This means X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   X reacts with liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's examine potential simple gas molecules containing Deuterium:\n        *   HD (¹H²): 2 protons, 1 neutron. Not equal.\n        *   **D₂ (²H₂)**: Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule D₂ has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match. So, **W = D₂**.\n    *   The reaction `X + Y -> D₂(g) + G(s)` produces pure D₂ gas. This is a characteristic reaction of a metal deuteride with a deuterated protic source. If the liquid Y were a normal protic solvent like H₂O, the gas would be a mixture of H₂, HD, and D₂. To get pure D₂, the liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium. The most common and logical choice for Y is **D₂O (heavy water)**, which we also identified as B's precursor.\n    *   The precipitate G is formed in the reaction `X + D₂O -> D₂ + G`. When heated, G releases B (D₂O). This is typical for a metal hydroxide (or in this case, deuteroxide) decomposing: `Metal Deuteroxide --heat--> Metal Oxide + D₂O`. Thus, G is a **metal deuteroxide**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**\n    *   From the deductions above, X is a metal deuteride that reacts violently with heavy water to form a metal deuteroxide precipitate and D₂ gas.\n    *   Crucially, X or its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid (`R-C(=O)-COOH`, which has 3 oxygen atoms) results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a strong reduction reaction, converting both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups into alcohol groups (`R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`), a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Let's consider the most famous hydride reducing agent in organic chemistry: Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's see if it fits all the clues:\n        *   It contains the heavier isotope D. **(✓)**\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reagent. **(✓)**\n        *   It reacts violently with water (and heavy water): `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`. This reaction is notoriously vigorous. **(✓)**\n        *   The reaction produces a precipitate G. Aluminum deuteroxide, `Al(OD)₃`, is the deuterated version of aluminum hydroxide, `Al(OH)₃`, which is a known gelatinous precipitate. **(✓)**\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (`Al(OD)₃`) would yield aluminum oxide and heavy water (`2Al(OD)₃ --heat--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`). **(✓)**\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a potent reducing agent, capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol (2 oxygens). **(✓)**\n    *   All clues point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are:\n        *   Lithium (Li): Atomic Number 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Atomic Number 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Atomic Number 1\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen** (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Al).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved:\n        *   Mass of one Al (²⁷Al) atom = 27\n        *   Mass of one D (²H) atom = 2\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one Aluminum atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of Al) + 4 * (Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 4 * 2 = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n```python\n# The identified substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements present in LiAlD4 are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n# The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n# The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n# The question requires the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# The specific isotopes are Aluminum-27 and Deuterium (Hydrogen-2).\n# Mass of one Aluminum-27 atom is 27.\n# Mass of one Deuterium atom is 2.\n# In one molecule of LiAlD4, there is 1 atom of Aluminum and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n# Cumulative mass = (1 * mass_of_Al) + (4 * mass_of_D)\nmass_Al = 27\nmass_D = 2\ntotal_mass = (1 * mass_Al) + (4 * mass_D)\nprint(total_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Conversion: 277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), containing the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match.\n    *   Conclusion: **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Heavier Isotope:** Since a derivative of the reaction (B) contains Deuterium, the \"heavier isotope\" in substance X must be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**. X is a deuterated compound.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given the context, we should examine gases containing Deuterium.\n    *   The Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of **D₂** gas would have (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Conclusion: **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n*   **The Reaction (X + Y -> W + G):**\n    *   Substance X (a deuteride) reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    *   To produce pure D₂ gas, the reactant liquid Y must also be a source of deuterium atoms. Otherwise, a mixture of H₂, HD, and D₂ would form. The most logical choice for Y is **D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   The reaction is: `X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is formed in the reaction and releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing to a metal oxide and heavy water. So, G must be a **metal deuteroxide**, M(OD)n.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance X:**\n    1.  X is a metal deuteride.\n    2.  Its non-deuterated analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    3.  It reacts with D₂O to form a precipitate.\n    4.  It reduces a keto acid (R-CO-COOH, 3 oxygens) to a product with 2 oxygens. This implies a strong reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, a diol).\n    *   The most famous and powerful hydride reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Let's check its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`. This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G = Al(OD)₃, aluminum deuteroxide). This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This also fits.\n        *   **Reduction of Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reagent to perform the required reduction. This fits.\n        *   **Common Reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a staple in organic synthesis labs. This fits.\n    *   Conclusion: **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2.
