    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts, A and B. Both are moving in the same direction. Let's find the velocity of astronaut A as observed from astronaut B's reference frame.\n\n*   Velocity of astronaut A, $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of astronaut B, $v_B = 0.5c$\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \\frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy ($E$) of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_A + E_B$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut A ($E_A$):**\n*   Mass, $m_A = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_A = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut A ($\\gamma_A$):\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut A:\n$E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut B ($E_B$):**\n*   Mass, $m_B = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_B = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut B ($\\gamma_B$):\n$\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy of astronaut B:\n$E_B = \\gamma_B m_B c^2 = 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy, $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation using a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1  # Speed of light in units of c\n\n# Astronaut A\nm_A_factor = 2\nv_A = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut B\nm_B_factor = 3\nv_B = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\nv_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c**2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel/c): {v_rel/c:.3f}\")\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Gamma factor for A\ngamma_A = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)**2)\n# Energy for A (in units of mc^2)\nE_A_factor = gamma_A * m_A_factor\n\n# Gamma factor for B\ngamma_B = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v_B/c)**2)\n# Energy for B (in units of mc^2)\nE_B_factor = gamma_B * m_B_factor\n\n# Total Energy (in units of mc^2)\nE_total_factor = E_A_factor + E_B_factor\nprint(f\"Total energy (E_total / (mc^2)): {E_total_factor:.3f}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nRelative speed (v_rel/c): 0.143\nTotal energy (E_total / (mc^2)): 5.964\n```\nThe python script confirms the manually calculated results. The relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for two quantities: the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts and the total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system of two astronauts.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nWe need to find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other. Let the astronaut with mass $2m$ be A, and the one with mass $3m$ be B. Their velocities in a stationary frame of reference (let's call it S) are:\n*   $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   $v_B = 0.5c$\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction is used to find the velocity of astronaut A as observed from astronaut B's reference frame ($S'$). This will be their relative velocity, $v_{rel}$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \\frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $0.14c$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts, as measured in the stationary frame S.\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut A ($E_A$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_A = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_A = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor for A ($\\gamma_A$):\n    $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy of A:\n    $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut B ($E_B$):**\n*   Rest mass: $m_B = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_B = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor for B ($\\gamma_B$):\n    $\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_B/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy of B:\n    $E_B = \\gamma_B m_B c^2 = (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately $0.14c$, and the total energy is approximately $5.96 mc^2$. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) $v_{rel}=0.14c, E=5mc^2$\n*   B) $v_{rel} = 1.1c , E= mc^2$\n*   C) $v_{rel} = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2$\n*   D) $v_{rel} =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2$\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
