    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species:**\n    The solution contains a central metal ion, Co(II) (`Co^2+`), and a ligand, thiocyanate (`SCN-`). They react to form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free cobalt ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Define total concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants:**\n    The overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Express total concentration in terms of free species:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Define the distribution coefficient (mole fraction):**\n    The fraction of any single species `[Co(SCN)n]` relative to the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is denoted by `αn`. The question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, which corresponds to `α2 * 100%`.\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M (This is assumed to be the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, a standard convention in such problems).\n    *   `β1` = 9\n    *   `β2` = 40\n    *   `β3` = 63\n    *   `β4` = 16\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator first. Let's call it `S`.\n    `S = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n    `S = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `S = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, let's calculate the numerator for `α2`:\n    `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Finally, calculate `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply `α2` by 100:\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\n    This value is closest to 16.9%. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed to calculate the percentage (the relative distribution) of the species.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_concentration = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The denominator of the alpha expression, often denoted as S or F0\ndenominator = (1 + \n               beta1 * scn_concentration**1 + \n               beta2 * scn_concentration**2 + \n               beta3 * scn_concentration**3 + \n               beta4 * scn_concentration**4)\n\n# The numerator for the alpha2 expression\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * scn_concentration**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n>>>\n16.91618032648228\n<<<\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species and equilibria:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species are the free ion `Co^2+` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`, and the given stability constants:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Derive the mole fraction (α2):**\n    The fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 2, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:**\n    Substitute the given values into the equation:\n    *   `[SCN-]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β1` = 9\n    *   `β2` = 40\n    *   `β3` = 63\n    *   `β4` = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator (D):\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator (N) for `α2`:\n    `N = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate the fraction `α2`:\n    `α2 = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<A>>>"
