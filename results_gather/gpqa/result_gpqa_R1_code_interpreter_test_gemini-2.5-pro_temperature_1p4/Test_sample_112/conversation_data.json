    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The goal is to determine the correct molecular formula for an unknown compound from a list of four options, using data from three analytical techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data**:\n    *   **\"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. While alcohol O-H groups also appear in this region, they are typically less broad.\n    *   **\"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\"**: This indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is consistent with the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **\"strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹\"**: This is the characteristic region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data**:\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**:\n    *   **\"fragment peak at m/z = 45\"**: This is a highly diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺).\n        *   Carbon (C) = ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O) = ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H) = ~1 amu\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings**:\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z=45) points conclusively to the presence of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl protons) points conclusively to the presence of an **alkene (C=C)** group.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**:\n    *   A key finding is the presence of a carboxylic acid, which contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n        *   A) C6H10O (Incorrect, only one oxygen)\n        *   D) C6H12O (Incorrect, only one oxygen)\n    *   This leaves us with two possibilities:\n        *   B) C6H10O2\n        *   C) C6H12O2\n\n7.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate**: The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   1 DoU for the C=O in the carboxylic acid.\n        *   1 DoU for the C=C in the alkene.\n        *   **Total required DoU = 2**.\n\n8.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options**: I will use a simple Python script to perform this calculation for all four initial options to be thorough.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a C, H, O formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0}\n    elements = re.findall('([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n    for element, count in elements:\n        if element == 'C':\n            counts['C'] = int(count)\n        elif element == 'H':\n            counts['H'] = int(count)\n    \n    C = counts['C']\n    H = counts['H']\n    \n    # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = {\"A\": \"C6H10O\", \"B\": \"C6H10O2\", \"C\": \"C6H12O2\", \"D\": \"C6H12O\"}\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):\")\nprint(f\"Required DoU based on spectral data (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C) = 2\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nfor key, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {key}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\n```\n>>>\nAnalysis of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):\nRequired DoU based on spectral data (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C) = 2\n--------------------------------------------------\nOption A) C6H10O: DoU = 2\nOption B) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\nOption C) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\nOption D) C6H12O: DoU = 1\n>>>\n9.  **Final Conclusion**:\n    *   The Python script confirms that options C and D have a DoU of 1, which is insufficient to account for both a carbonyl and an alkene group.\n    *   Both options A and B have the required DoU of 2.\n    *   However, as established in step 6, the compound must be a carboxylic acid and therefore must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   Option A (C6H10O) only has one oxygen atom and is thus eliminated.\n    *   Option B (C6H10O2) has two oxygen atoms AND the correct degree of unsaturation (2). It is the only formula that fits all the provided spectral evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the analytical data provided, let's break down the evidence for each technique:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is consistent with the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The observation of **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C double bond), which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass of C=12, O=16, H=1: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesis of Evidence**:\nThe combined data from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates the compound is a **carboxylic acid**, which means it must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n\nWe are left with two choices:\n*   B) C6H10O2\n*   C) C6H12O2\n\nThe data also confirms the presence of an **alkene** (a C=C double bond). We can use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining options. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total DoU of at least **2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   For **B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n*   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match our requirement, as it can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional alkene C=C bond.\n\nOnly the chemical formula C6H10O2 fits all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<B>>>"
