    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($[CaY^{2-}]$) from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and fully deprotonated EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) is represented by the following equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY^{2-}]$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$, also given as KCa-EDTA) for this reaction is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe start with a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$. This complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[CaY^{2-}] \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $[CaY^{2-}]$ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY^{2-}]$    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x M      |\n| $[Ca^{2+}]$     | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n| $[Y^{4-}]$      | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n\n**3. Apply the Equilibrium Constant Expression**\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Solve for x**\nSince the formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex. This means that the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nTo find x, take the square root of both sides:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n\nTo verify this calculation, we can use a computational tool.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Simplified equation: K_f ~= initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / K_f)\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\nThe concentration of Ca2+ ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n\n**5.

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core chemical process.** The problem describes a solution of Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $[CaY^{2-}] \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the process to the given constant.** The problem provides the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$, for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY^{2-}]$\n    The expression for this formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium table (ICE table).** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$, and no free ions. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the system reaches equilibrium. Due to the stoichiometry of the dissociation (1:1:1), if 'x' moles/L of the complex dissociate, 'x' moles/L of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' moles/L of $Y^{4-}$ will be formed.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY^{2-}]$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $[Ca^{2+}]$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $[Y^{4-}]$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation.** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex), meaning the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for 'x'.** 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.324 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Verify the calculation with a Python script.** This ensures accuracy and avoids manual arithmetic errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = [CaY]/([Ca][Y])\n# At equilibrium, [CaY] = 0.02 - x, [Ca] = x, [Y] = x\n# K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so we approximate 0.02 - x â 0.02\n# K_f â 0.02 / x^2\n# x^2 â 0.02 / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions [Ca2+] is approximately {x:.3e} M\")\n\n```\nThe code output confirms the manual calculation.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    Calculated $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    The options are:\n    A) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
