    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (a common gut pathogen) tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This mimics a natural route of infection for gut pathogens.\n    *   **Antigen Tracking:** The GFP tag allows visualization of the protein's path. Some is lost (stomach acid, mucus), but some reaches its target.\n    *   **Target Location:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, crucial for initiating intestinal immune responses. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has been taken up by cells in this location.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation (clonal expansion) is a key feature of an adaptive immune response, where specific lymphocytes (B or T cells) that recognize the antigen multiply.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"high variability\" is observed in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the findings:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins in the blood and tissue fluids. It does not involve gene sequencing of proliferating cells or changes to the variable heavy chain gene. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, it does not affect the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question specifically states variability was found in the *variable* heavy chain gene. Thus, this is not the primary process described, although it might be happening in parallel.\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the vast diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies) and T cell receptors. It occurs in developing lymphocytes (pro-B and pre-B cells) within the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow). The experiment describes a process happening in mature, *proliferating* cells in a *secondary* lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* encountering an antigen. V(D)J recombination has already been completed before this stage. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within structures called germinal centers, which form in secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies. B cells whose mutations lead to higher affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate (a process called affinity maturation). This mechanism perfectly explains the finding of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" isolated from an antigen-stimulated \"Peyer's patch\".\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
