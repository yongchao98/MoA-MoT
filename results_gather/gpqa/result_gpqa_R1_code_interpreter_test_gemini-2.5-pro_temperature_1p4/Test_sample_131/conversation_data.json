    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that each compound contributes a set of protons that results in a singlet, and the number of protons for each singlet is identical. For example, compound A has a singlet for X protons and compound B has a singlet for X protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This means there are three distinct types of aliphatic protons, and their total numbers are in the ratio 2:1:1. The signals are all singlets, which implies the proton groups (likely methyl groups) have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. They appear as **four separate singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the left and right halves mirror images.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons coupled to each other appear as a singlet. So, they produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one pair). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent (a second pair). These two pairs are in different environments. This results in **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals are characteristic of an ethyl group. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (4H total) and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H). Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be immediately **eliminated**.\n\n**3. Analyze the combinations based on the options:**\n\nWe need a combination of two compounds that, when mixed 1:1, produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the option that looks most promising first: **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Total:** Two singlets. Since they both represent 2H, their integral ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Total:** Three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n\nThis combination perfectly explains the observed spectrum. Let's briefly check why other options are incorrect.\n*   **Option A:** (1,2,3,4-TMB) + (1,2,3,5-TMB) would give 1+2 = 3 aromatic signals. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** (1,2,4,5-TMB) + (1,2,3,5-TMB) would give 1+2 = 3 aromatic signals. Incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** Involves 1,4-diethylbenzene, which was eliminated because it gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n```python\ndef predict_nmr_summary(compound_name):\n    \"\"\"Predicts the NMR signals for the given compounds.\"\"\"\n    if compound_name == \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\":\n        return \"Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H), Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\"\n    elif compound_name == \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\":\n        return \"Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each), Aliphatic: 4 singlets (3H each)\"\n    elif compound_name == \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\":\n        return \"Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H), Aliphatic: 2 singlets (6H each)\"\n    elif compound_name == \"1,4-diethylbenzene\":\n        return \"Aromatic: 1 singlet (4H), Aliphatic: 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown\"\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\")\nprint(\"Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):\", predict_nmr_summary(\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\"))\nprint(\"Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):\", predict_nmr_summary(\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"))\nprint(\"\\nPredicted combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture:\")\nprint(\"Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from Cmpd 1 + 1 singlet (2H) from Cmpd 2 => 2 singlets, ratio 1:1.\")\nprint(\"Aliphatic signals: 1 singlet (12H) from Cmpd 1 + 2 singlets (6H each) from Cmpd 2 => 3 singlets, ratio 12:6:6 or 2:1:1.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: The prediction for Option B perfectly matches the experimental data.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible molecules and see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Individual Compounds:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons.

Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be immediately **eliminated**.\n\n**Evaluating the Mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This would give 1 + 2 = **3 aromatic singlets**. Incorrect.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. **Total: 2 singlets.** Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integral ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. **Total: 3 singlets.** The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches.\n    *   This combination perfectly fits the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This would give 1 + 2 = **3 aromatic singlets**. Incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This option is eliminated because it includes 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
