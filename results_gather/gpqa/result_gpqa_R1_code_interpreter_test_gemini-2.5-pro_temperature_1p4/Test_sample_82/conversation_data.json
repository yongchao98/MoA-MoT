    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n    *   We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   Final concentration (M2) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    *   So, we are titrating a 0.025 M acetic acid solution.\n\n2.  **Understand the state at 25% titration.**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n    *   This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n    *   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer solution.\n\n3.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.**\n    *   The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, we need to calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n        [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n    *   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n        pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n        pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the conditions at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH.\n    *   The solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates completely into Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻ ions.\n    *   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point.**\n    *   First, find the initial moles of acetic acid:\n        Moles of HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of HA = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume of the solution = Initial volume of acid + Volume of NaOH added\n        Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] is also 'x', and [CH₃COO⁻] is (0.02 - x). We can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 since Kb is very small.\n        5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n        pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\n### **Calculation Summary using Python**\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the calculations with a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05\ninitial_acid_vol_cm3 = 20.00\nwater_vol_cm3 = 20.00\nnaoh_conc = 0.1\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at 25% titration ---\n# 1. Dilution\ndiluted_acid_vol_cm3 = initial_acid_vol_cm3 + water_vol_cm3\ndiluted_acid_conc = (initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol_cm3) / diluted_acid_vol_cm3\n\n# 2. Henderson-Hasselbalch\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at equivalence point ---\n# 1. Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = diluted_acid_conc * (diluted_acid_vol_cm3 / 1000)\n\n# 2. Volume of NaOH for equivalence\nvol_naoh_equiv_L = moles_acid / naoh_conc\n\n# 3. Concentration of acetate at equivalence\ntotal_volume_equiv_L = (diluted_acid_vol_cm3 / 1000) + vol_naoh_equiv_L\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_volume_equiv_L\n\n# 4. pH from hydrolysis\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate] => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step calculations:\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
