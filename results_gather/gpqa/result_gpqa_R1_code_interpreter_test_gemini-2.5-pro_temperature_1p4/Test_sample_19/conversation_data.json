    "This is a conceptual question about the foundations of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Let's break down each assumption and see how it contributes to the overall approximation.\n\nThe core idea of the **impulse approximation** is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus happens so quickly that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The other nucleons in the nucleus are considered \"spectators\" and the binding forces are negligible during the very short time of the interaction.\n\nLet's analyze the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a fundamental prerequisite. If the interaction could involve multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., via meson-exchange currents), then you could not approximate the process as an interaction with a single \"free\" nucleon. The target would be a more complex, correlated system. Therefore, this assumption is necessary to isolate the interaction to a single constituent.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption addresses the initial and final state interactions (FSI). If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles could interact with other nucleons on their way in or out, the measured kinematics would be distorted. The process would not be \"clean\". Assuming the nucleus is transparent means we neglect these FSI. This is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA), as it ensures that what we observe is the result of the primary interaction alone, not a convolution of multiple scatterings.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption describes a specific model *of the nucleon itself* (the non-relativistic quark model). The impulse approximation, however, is about the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus* during an interaction. It doesn't depend on the specific internal structure model of the nucleon. In fact, the impulse approximation is often used in high-energy relativistic scenarios where the quarks are definitely *not* non-relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" in the approximation's name. The energy and momentum transferred in the interaction are assumed to be much larger than the binding energy of the nucleon or its interaction energy with neighboring nucleons. This justifies ignoring the nuclear potential during the brief moment of the interaction, allowing us to treat the nucleon's kinematics as if it were a free particle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo treat a nucleon in a nucleus as a free nucleon for the purpose of an interaction, you must assume:\n- The interaction targets only that nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere with the incoming or outgoing particles (Assumption 2).\n- The binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus can be ignored during the interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nAssumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation. Assumption 3 is related to a separate modeling choice for the nucleon's internal structure and is not a required part of this approximation.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
