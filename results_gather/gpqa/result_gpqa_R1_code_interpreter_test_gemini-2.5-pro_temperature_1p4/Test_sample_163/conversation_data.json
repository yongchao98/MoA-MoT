    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (let's call it M1_total) to the total mass of system_2 (M2_total). This is the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, i.e., we need to calculate `M1_total / M2_total`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 2a (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 1b (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Key Detail:** Both systems are eclipsing.\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate Physics Formula:**\n    For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information:**\n    The fact that the systems are \"eclipsing\" is crucial. Eclipses occur only when the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Proportionality:**\n    With `sin³(i) ≈ 1`, the formula becomes:\n    `M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)`\n\n    Since `2 * π * G` is a constant, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n6.  **Set Up the Ratio:**\n    We can now find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 by dividing their respective proportionalities:\n\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities:**\n    *   For system_1: `K1_sum = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For system_2: `K2_sum = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n8.  **Substitute Values and Compute the Ratio:**\n    Now, plug the values into the ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s because the units will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]`\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = 54 / 125`\n    `(M1_total / M2_total) = 0.432`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to option B.\n    *   A) ~ 0.6\n    *   B) ~ 0.4\n    *   C) ~ 1.2\n    *   D) ~ 0.7\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass of an eclipsing spectroscopic binary is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nK1_sum = K1a + K1b\nK2_sum = K2a + K2b\n\n# The term proportional to the mass for each system can be calculated directly.\n# The constants of proportionality will cancel out in the ratio.\nM1_proportional_term = P1 * (K1_sum)**3\nM2_proportional_term = P2 * (K2_sum)**3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses\nmass_ratio = M1_proportional_term / M2_proportional_term\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe python code confirms the result of 0.432.

    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1_total / M2_total).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be determined using a form of Kepler's Third Law. The formula relates the total mass to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2):\n    \n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    \n    where `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n2.  **Use the \"eclipsing\" information:** The problem states that both binary systems are \"eclipsing.\" Eclipses can only occur when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n\n3.  **Establish a proportionality:** Since `2 * π * G` is a universal constant and `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both systems, we can establish a direct proportionality for the total mass:\n    \n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n4.  **Set up the ratio:** To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can create a ratio of their masses using this proportionality. The constants will cancel out.\n    \n    `M1_total / M2_total = (P1 * (K1_a + K1_b)³) / (P2 * (K2_a + K2_b)³)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   **For System 1:**\n        *   Period `P1` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `(K1_a + K1_b)` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **For System 2:**\n        *   Period `P2` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `(K2_a + K2_b)` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio:**\n    \n    `M1_total / M2_total = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n    `M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1_total / M2_total = 54 / 125`\n    `M1_total / M2_total = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the Python script, which yielded the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432.
