    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy. This total energy is conserved.\n    The total energy $E_{total}$ can be written as:\n    $E_{total} = E_{relativistic} + U(x)$\n    where $E_{relativistic} = \\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of the particle (including its rest energy), and $U(x)$ is the potential energy. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of the Harmonic Oscillator**\n    The force on the mass is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force, taking the potential energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$) to be zero, is:\n    $U(x) = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n    So, the conservation of energy equation for the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    The oscillator reaches its maximum amplitude at $x = A$. At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    Since energy is conserved, this is the total energy of the system at all points in its motion.\n\n4.  **Energy at Maximum Speed**\n    The speed of the mass is maximum when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor corresponding to $v_{max}$ is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equating Energies and Solving for v_max**\n    Now, we equate the expressions for the total energy from steps 3 and 4:\n    $ \\gamma_{max} mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 $\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $ \\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} $\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} $\n\n    Invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n    $ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} $\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    $ 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} $\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $ \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} $\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $ v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} $\n\n    This expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
