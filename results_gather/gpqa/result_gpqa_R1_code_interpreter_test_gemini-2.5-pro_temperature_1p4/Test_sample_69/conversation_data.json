    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Clues and Identify Key Substances\n\n1.  **C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**: This hydrolysis reaction is the most chemically informative clue. The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, upon adding water is characteristic of the hydrolysis of specific types of compounds.\n    *   A common weak acid formed in inorganic hydrolysis reactions is **Hydrofluoric acid (HF)**. Let's assume **G = HF**.\n    *   This implies that compound **B**, the gas used in the synthesis of C, is **Fluorine (F₂)**, as it is the source of the fluoride ions.\n    *   The formation of a strong acid **F** alongside HF suggests that C contains another element that, upon hydrolysis, forms a strong oxoacid. The most common examples are nitric acid (HNO₃), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), or perchloric acid (HClO₄). The formation of **Nitric acid (HNO₃)** from a nitronium ion ([NO₂]⁺) is a common scenario in these types of puzzles. Let's hypothesize that **F = HNO₃**.\n    *   The reaction regenerates solid A. If the central element in the complex C is a metal M, its hydrolysis often yields a metal oxide. Since A is regenerated, **A** is likely a metal oxide.\n\n2.  **Putting it together for C**: If hydrolysis of C yields a metal oxide (A), HNO₃ (F), and HF (G), then C must be a nitronium salt of a metal fluoride complex. Let's represent the metal as M. To yield two HNO₃ molecules (from two nitronium ions), the formula would be **C = (NO₂)₂[MFₓ]²⁻**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Metal M and Product E**: The clue \"extremely hazardous product E\" points towards elements like Plutonium (Pu) or Uranium (U). Let's consider Uranium (U). The most common hazardous compound of uranium in this context is **Uranium Hexafluoride (UF₆)**. It is a volatile solid used in uranium enrichment, and is highly toxic and radioactive. Let's assume **E = UF₆**.\n    *   This means our metal M is Uranium. So, **A = UO₂** (Uranium dioxide, a common solid oxide of uranium). And **C = (NO₂)₂[UF₈]** (Nitronium octofluorouranate(VI)). The charge of the anion is 2- to balance the two [NO₂]⁺ cations, and the oxidation state of uranium is +6, which is consistent with the formation of UF₆.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hydrolysis of C**: Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = (NO₂)₂[UF₈] works as predicted.\n    `(NO₂)₂[UF₈](s) + 4H₂O(l) → UO₂(s) + 2HNO₃(aq) + 8HF(aq)`\n    This reaction regenerates solid A (UO₂), and produces a strong acid F (HNO₃) and a weak acid G (HF). This is perfectly consistent with the clues.\n\n5.  **Analyze the remaining clues with these identifications**:\n    *   **A(UO₂) + 8B(F₂) → C((NO₂)₂[UF₈])**: This synthesis is unusual and represents the most difficult clue. It requires a nitrogen source, which is not explicit. In the context of a chemical puzzle, we assume this pathway exists as described.\n    *   **C((NO₂)₂[UF₈]) + 2D(g) → E(UF₆)**: This reaction describes the conversion of the complex salt C into the simpler product E.\n    *   **D(g) + B(F₂) → H(solvent)**: A 1:1 reaction between a gas D and fluorine gas (B) to form a solvent (H).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nNow that we have confidently identified **E = UF₆**, we can determine its molecular symmetry group.\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Geometry**: UF₆ has a central Uranium atom bonded to six Fluorine atoms. According to VSEPR theory (AX₆ configuration), the molecule has an **octahedral** geometry.\n\n2.  **Identify Symmetry Elements**: An octahedral molecule like UF₆ possesses a high degree of symmetry:\n    *   Multiple rotational axes (C₄, C₃, C₂).\n    *   An inversion center (i).\n    *   Multiple mirror planes (both horizontal σh and dihedral σd).\n\n3.  **Assign the Point Group**: The point group for a perfect octahedral molecule is **Oₕ**.\n\n### Step 3: Reconcile with the Given Options\n\nThe derived point group Oₕ is not among the options provided:\nA) D₄h\nB) C₂\nC) D∞h\nD) C₂v\n\nThis indicates a potential issue with the question's options or a trick in the question itself. Let's analyze the options:\n*   D₄h corresponds to a square planar geometry (like XeF₄).\n*   D∞h corresponds to a linear molecule with an inversion center (like CO₂).\n*   C₂ and C₂v correspond to molecules with much lower symmetry.\n\nThere are two possibilities for this discrepancy:\n1.  The identification of E is wrong. However, the chemical clues point very strongly to UF₆. Attempts to identify E as a molecule with one of the given symmetries lead to contradictions with the chemical reactions described.\n2.  There is a trick. A common trick in such questions is to refer to the symmetry of the molecule in its solid crystal state, which is lower than in the gas phase. The crystal structure of UF₆ is orthorhombic, belonging to the space group Pnma, whose point group is D₂h. The point group C₂v is a subgroup of D₂h. This is a plausible, though convoluted, explanation.\n\nAnother possibility is that E is not UF₆ but another uranium compound, **UO₂F₂ (Uranyl fluoride)**.\n*   **Hazard**: UO₂F₂ is also radioactive and toxic, fitting the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n*   **Symmetry**: The UO₂²⁺ group is linear (O=U=O), and the two fluorine atoms are bonded equatorially. This gives the molecule a bent shape overall, with a **C₂v** point group. This matches option **D**.\n*   **Plausibility**: Let's check if forming UO₂F₂ makes sense. The reaction is C + 2D → UO₂F₂. Our identified C is (NO₂)₂[UF₈]. For this to become UO₂F₂, the reaction with D would need to be an oxidative hydrolysis of sorts, adding oxygen and removing fluorine. This is complex but not impossible within the puzzle's logic.\n\nGiven that **UO₂F₂** fits the \"extremely hazardous\" description, is a plausible compound in uranium-fluorine chemistry, and has a **C₂v symmetry** which is one of the options, this presents a more direct solution than the solid-state symmetry argument for UF₆.\n\nTherefore, the most likely intended answer is that **E is UO₂F₂**.\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular symmetry of UO₂F₂.\n*   The molecule has a C₂ axis passing through the U atom and bisecting the F-U-F and O=U=O angles.\n*   It has a mirror plane containing the U and two F atoms (σv).\n*   It has a second mirror plane perpendicular to the first, containing the O=U=O atoms (σv').\n*   These elements (E, C₂, σv, σv') define the **C₂v** point group.\n\nFinal conclusion points to E being UO₂F₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
