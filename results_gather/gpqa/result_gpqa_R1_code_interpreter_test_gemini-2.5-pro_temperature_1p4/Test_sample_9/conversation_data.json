    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options:** We are given four scenarios for exoplanets and need to compare their densities. The key physical principle here is that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity, which compresses its material to a higher density.\n\n2.  **Establish a baseline:**\n    *   **Option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.** This is essentially Earth. Earth's average density is a standard value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E. So, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **Option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.** The density is given directly as ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze the effect of mass on density for planets of the same composition:**\n    *   **Option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n        *   Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is much more massive (Mass M_c = 5 M_Earth), its internal gravity will be much stronger.\n        *   This stronger gravity will compress the rock and metal in its interior more than in the Earth.\n        *   Increased compression leads to a higher density. Therefore, the density of this planet (ρ_c) must be significantly greater than Earth's density (ρ_c > ρ_E).\n\n    *   **Option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n        *   This planet has the same composition but is less massive (Mass M_d = 0.5 M_Earth).\n        *   Its internal gravity will be weaker than Earth's.\n        *   Weaker gravity leads to less compression of its constituent materials.\n        *   Therefore, the density of this planet (ρ_d) must be less than Earth's density (ρ_d < ρ_E).\n\n4.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression from higher mass)\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression from lower mass)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, the planet in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^k, where k is about 0.27. Density (ρ) is proportional to M/R³, so ρ ∝ M / (M^k)³ = M^(1-3k). Let's calculate the densities relative to Earth (ρ_E).\n\n```python\n# Earth's density in g/cm^3\nrho_E = 5.51\n\n# Option a: Earth itself\nrho_a = rho_E\n\n# Option b: Given density\nrho_b = 5.5\n\n# Option c: 5x Earth mass, same composition\n# Mass-radius exponent k for rocky planets\nk = 0.27\n# rho_c = rho_E * (Mass_Ratio)^(1-3k)\nrho_c = rho_E * (5)**(1 - 3*k)\n\n# Option d: 0.5x Earth mass, same composition\n# rho_d = rho_E * (Mass_Ratio)^(1-3k)\nrho_d = rho_E * (0.5)**(1 - 3*k)\n\n# Print the results for comparison\nprint(f\"Density of planet a: {rho_a:.2f} g/cm^3\")\nprint(f\"Density of planet b: {rho_b:.2f} g/cm^3\")\nprint(f\"Density of planet c: {rho_c:.2f} g/cm^3\")\nprint(f\"Density of planet d: {rho_d:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n# Find the highest density\ndensities = {'a': rho_a, 'b': rho_b, 'c': rho_c, 'd': rho_d}\nmax_density_planet = max(densities, key=densities.get)\nprint(f\"\\nThe planet with the highest density is '{max_density_planet}'.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet (a):** This is a baseline planet, essentially a replica of Earth. Its density is the average density of Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b):** The density is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. A fundamental principle of planetary science is that for planets of the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger self-gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material (rock and iron) more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, the density of this planet will be significantly *greater* than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (d):** This planet also has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. Its self-gravity will be weaker than Earth's. Consequently, its material will be less compressed, resulting in an overall density that is *lower* than Earth's density.\n\n5.  **Comparison:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nThe code execution confirms this reasoning quantitatively, showing that planet (c) has a calculated density of approximately 7.48 g/cm³, which is the highest among the options. Therefore, the planet with 5 times Earth's mass and the same composition will be the densest due to gravitational compression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
