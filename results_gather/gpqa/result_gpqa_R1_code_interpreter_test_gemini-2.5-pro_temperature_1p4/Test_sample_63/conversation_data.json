    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products and the separation process.**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of tube №1 is 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial clue: no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition. This eliminates salts like carbonates, oxalates, or sulfites.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states that CuO is formed.\n    *   The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO (or potentially Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) captured by Cu = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   If the gas was O₂, then moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol. The mass of this O₂ gas is 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n\n*   **Remaining gas (C):** The gas that does not react with any of the three tubes.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Molar volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This non-reactive gas, in the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g) by the law of conservation of mass. Let's verify this.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ (the oxidizing gas) = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (gas C) = moles × molar mass = 0.1 mol × (2 × 14.01 g/mol) = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that the salts A and B contain only Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   n(H) = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.1 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   n(N) = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with Cu.\n    *   n(O) = n(O in H₂O) + n(O captured by Cu) = n(H₂O) + n(O atoms) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Find the empirical formula of the combined salts (A+B).**\n\nWe have the molar ratio of the elements in the total mixture:\nn(H) : n(N) : n(O) = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\n\nTo convert this to a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest number (0.2):\nH : N : O = (0.4/0.2) : (0.2/0.2) : (0.25/0.2)\nH : N : O = 2 : 1 : 1.25\n\nTo make all numbers integers, multiply the ratio by 4:\nH : N : O = (2 × 4) : (1 × 4) : (1.25 × 4)\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nSo, the total formula for the equimolar mixture of A and B is (H₈N₄O₅)ₖ for some integer k. Since we have one mole of A and one mole of B, the combined formula is simply A + B = H₈N₄O₅.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain only H, N, and O. This strongly suggests the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺) and the anions are oxyanions of nitrogen (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's see if adding these two formulas gives our derived combined formula:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). We can also verify this with their known decomposition reactions, which can produce H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing agent (O₂ or N₂O), consistent with the problem statement. The fact that the mixture is equimolar is key to this simple addition.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms:**\n    *   Total = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the mass calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 15.999\n\n# We identified the salts as NH4NO3 and NH4NO2 in an equimolar mixture.\n# From the product analysis, we found there were x moles of each, and x=0.05.\n# Let's verify the total mass.\nmoles_each_salt = 0.05\n\n# Molar Mass of NH4NO3\nM_NH4NO3 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 3*M_O\n# Molar Mass of NH4NO2\nM_NH4NO2 = 2*M_N + 4*M_H + 2*M_O\n\n# Calculate the mass of the initial mixture\ntotal_mass = moles_each_salt * M_NH4NO3 + moles_each_salt * M_NH4NO2\n\n# Calculate the number of atoms\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3  # For NH4NO3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2  # For NH4NO2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass of the mixture: {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Given total mass: 7.20 g\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to identify the gaseous products.**\n    1.  The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into gases. Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n    2.  The gas mixture passes through Tube №1 containing anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a strong drying agent. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    3.  The remaining gases pass through Tube №2 containing Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). The weight does not change, which means no acidic gases (like CO₂ or SO₂) were produced. This suggests the salts are not carbonates, sulfites, etc.\n    4.  The gases then pass through Tube №3 containing red-hot copper. The weight increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This means an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper. The 0.80 g mass increase is purely from the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) captured by copper = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    5.  The final remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, which in the context of heating nitrogen-based salts is almost certainly nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    The initial 7.20 g of salts must be composed of the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (from H₂O), Oxygen (from H₂O and the oxidizing gas), and Nitrogen (from N₂ and possibly the oxidizing gas). Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n    *   **Total moles of H:** All hydrogen ended up in H₂O.\n        n(H) = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of O:** Oxygen is in the water and the oxidizing gas.\n        n(O) = n(O in H₂O) + n(O captured by Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of N:** Nitrogen is in gas C (N₂) and possibly the oxidizing gas. A common oxidizing gas from heating nitrogen salts is N₂O. If we assume the oxidizing gas was N₂O, its decomposition on hot copper would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This fits our observations: 0.05 mol of O atoms would come from 0.05 mol of N₂O, which would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n        Total n(N) = 2 × n(N₂ from gas C) + 2 × n(N₂O)\n        But it's easier to find the total moles of N atoms using a mass balance.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n        *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.0 g = 2.8 g.\n        *   Total moles of N = 2.8 g / 14 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the combined formula of the equimolar mixture.**\n    We have the molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts A and B:\n    n(N) : n(H) : n(O) = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\n    To find the simplest integer ratio, divide by the smallest number (0.2):\n    N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    To make all numbers integers, multiply by 4:\n    N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n    The total formula for the mixture (one part A and one part B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts containing N, H, and O. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. We need to split the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible chemical formulas.\n    *   Let's consider ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Formula of ammonium nitrate: N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Formula of ammonium nitrite: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Adding them together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\n    This is a perfect match. So, salt A is NH₄NO₃ and salt B is NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nTo double-check the logic, we can use a Python script to verify that the identified salts in the correct molar amounts produce the given initial mass. The previous reasoning already established the moles of each salt in the 7.20 g mixture to be 0.05 mol.\n```python\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_N = 14.007\nM_H = 1.008\nM_O = 15.999\n\n# Moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture\nmoles_of_each_salt = 0.05\n\n# Molar Mass of Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH4NO3)\nM_salt_A = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 3 * M_O\n\n# Molar Mass of Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH4NO2)\nM_salt_B = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 2 * M_O\n\n# Calculate the total mass of the mixture\ntotal_mass_calculated = moles_of_each_salt * M_salt_A + moles_of_each_salt * M_salt_B\n\n# Number of atoms\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3  # N2H4O3\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2  # N2H4O2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"The calculated total mass is: {total_mass_calculated:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"The total number of atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gaseous Products and Their Interactions:**\n    *   An initial equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, with a total mass of 7.20 g, is heated. It decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This chemical is a potent desiccant (drying agent). It absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.008 * 2 + 15.999 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ to form a precipitate. The problem states its weight did not change. This is a critical clue: no acidic gases were formed. Therefore, the original salts are not carbonates, sulfites, oxalates, etc.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increase is 0.80 g. This mass gain is due to the oxygen atoms bonding with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that passed through all three tubes unreacted has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This non-reactive gas, in the context of heating salts that produce H₂O and an oxidizing gas, is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing gas that provides oxygen. This means the original salts A and B are composed only of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Let's perform a mass balance to confirm our product identification.\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n        *   Mass of N₂ (Gas C) = Moles * Molar Mass = 0.1 mol * (2 * 14.0 g/mol) = 2.80 g.\n        *   The oxidizing gas must account for the remaining mass. Let's find the mass of oxygen atoms from the reaction with copper: 0.80 g.\n        *   Let's check the total mass of all elemental components:\n            *   Mass of H = Moles of H₂O * 2 * M_H = 0.2 mol * 2 * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n            *   Mass of N = Moles of N₂ * 2 * M_N = 0.1 mol * 2 * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n            *   Mass of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O captured by Cu) = (0.2 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Total Mass = Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly. Our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n3.  **Find the Combined Empirical Formula of Salts A and B:**\n    *   From the previous step, we have the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture:\n        *   n(H) = 0.4 mol\n        *   n(N) = 0.2 mol\n        *   n(O) = Moles of O atoms = (0.2 mol from H₂O) + (0.05 mol from Cu reaction) = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Let's find the simplest molar ratio:\n        *   N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25\n    *   To get integers, divide by the smallest value (0.2):\n        *   N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n    *   Multiply the entire ratio by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n        *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n    *   The combined formula of the equimolar mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   The problem states A and B form an equimolar mixture. We need to split the total formula N₄H₈O₅ into two chemically plausible salt formulas. Since the salts contain only N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's try to combine two common salts: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n        *   Formula for Ammonium Nitrate: **N₂H₄O₃**\n        *   Formula for Ammonium Nitrite: **N₂H₄O₂**\n    *   Adding these two formulas together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    *   This is a perfect match. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each).\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
