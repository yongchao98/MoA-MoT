    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. Let's identify its structure and stereochemistry.\n    *   The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane) with a ketone group at position 3, a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. It remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion from LAH on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces. This leads to the formation of two stereoisomers.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The two products have two stereocenters. One center is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n    *   Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   For a molecule with two chiral centers, there is a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Now consider (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R). Because the molecule is symmetrical (the groups attached to C2 are the same as the groups attached to C4), the (2R, 4S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. It is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomeric products: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II:\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not be separated from each other and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties. It will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are constitutionally different molecules and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental overlap.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC Column**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a chiral molecule)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (a chiral molecule)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (an achiral molecule, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five compounds.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
