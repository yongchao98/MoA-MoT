    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as seen in some biphenyls). Conversely, a molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it has an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound with substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, it has nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   Substituted biphenyls can be chiral if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   The bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (-NO2 and -COOCH3 are large groups) cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is the case here because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 at C2 and an -NO2 at C6 are different). The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion due to its twisted, non-planar structure.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism) and is therefore optically active.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   Let's focus on the central carbon atom (C2), the one bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   An atom bonded to four different substituent groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula `(C6H5)2C=O`. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized (double bond).\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   Due to the *trans* configuration, the molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. A plane of symmetry also exists if the molecule is considered planar.\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It is a stereoisomer—specifically, a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate—but it is not an optical isomer).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Optically active (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Optically active (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Optically inactive (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Optically inactive (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n```python\n# This script uses the rdkit cheminformatics library to help verify the analysis.\n# rdkit can identify tetrahedral chiral centers.

    "To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n    *   It has bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   This significant steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation, combined with the asymmetric substitution on each ring, means the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. It lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the molecule.\n    *   Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
