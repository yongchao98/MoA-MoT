    "This problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. A key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this system are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy `E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n    So, $E_1 = 1^2E = E$, $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$, $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$, and so on.\n*   **Quantum States:** For each particle, a complete quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin projection `m_s`. Since the particles are spin-1/2, `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down). This means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available quantum states. Consequently, a maximum of two particles can occupy the same energy level `n`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the State Energies\n\nWe will determine the configuration of the four particles for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state by filling the energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### Ground State (E_gs)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Particle 1 & 2:** Fill the n=1 level. One particle takes the (n=1, spin up) state, and the other takes the (n=1, spin down) state. The energy level n=1 is now full.\n    *   Energy from these two particles = $E_1 + E_1 = E + E = 2E$.\n*   **Particle 3 & 4:** Fill the next lowest level, n=2. One particle takes (n=2, spin up) and the other takes (n=2, spin down).\n    *   Energy from these two particles = $E_2 + E_2 = 4E + 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n$E_{gs} = (E_1 + E_1) + (E_2 + E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n#### First Excited State (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The ground state configuration of quantum numbers `n` is (1, 1, 2, 2).\n*   We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is (1, 1, 2, 3).\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    $E_{1st} = (E_1 + E_1) + E_2 + E_3 = (E + E) + 4E + 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n#### Second Excited State (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\nLet's analyze the possibilities starting from the ground state configuration (1, 1, 2, 2):\n1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration becomes (1, 2, 2, 3).\n    *   Energy = $E_1 + E_2 + E_2 + E_3 = E + 4E + 4E + 9E = 18E$.\n2.  **Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration becomes (1, 1, 3, 3).\n    *   Energy = $E_1 + E_1 + E_3 + E_3 = E + E + 9E + 9E = 20E$.\n3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration becomes (1, 1, 2, 4).\n    *   Energy = $E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_4 = E + E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states:\n*   First excited state energy = 15E\n*   The next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nThus, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary of Energies\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\nTo confirm the ranking of state energies, a simple calculation can be performed.\n```python\n# A simple script to calculate the energies of different configurations for 4 fermions\n# in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy unit is E = pi^2*hbar^2 / (2*m*L^2).\n# A configuration is represented by a list of the principal quantum numbers [n1, n2, n3, n4].\n# For fermions, each 'n' value can appear at most twice.\n\ndef calculate_total_energy(config):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total energy for a given configuration of quantum numbers.\"\"\"\n    total_energy = 0\n    for n in config:\n        total_energy += n**2\n    return total_energy\n\n# Ground State Configuration: [1, 1, 2, 2]\nground_state_config = [1, 1, 2, 2]\nE_gs = calculate_total_energy(ground_state_config)\n\n# --- Possible Excited States ---\n# By promoting one particle from the ground state\n# config_1: promote one from n=2 to n=3\nconfig_1 = [1, 1, 2, 3]\nE_1 = calculate_total_energy(config_1)\n\n# config_2: promote one from n=1 to n=3\nconfig_2 = [1, 2, 2, 3]\nE_2 = calculate_total_energy(config_2)\n\n# By promoting two particles from the ground state\n# config_3: promote both from n=2 to n=3\nconfig_3 = [1, 1, 3, 3]\nE_3 = calculate_total_energy(config_3)\n\n# By promoting one particle further\n# config_4: promote one from n=2 to n=4\nconfig_4 = [1, 1, 2, 4]\nE_4 = calculate_total_energy(config_4)\n\n# We have found several low-lying energy states.

Since spin can be either up (+1/2) or down (-1/2), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system for its ground state, first excited state, and second excited state by filling the available energy levels with the four particles.\n\n**1. Ground State**\n\nFor the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`.\n    *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy = $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 8E$.\n*   The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    *   $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**2.

Second Excited State**\n\nThe second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state configuration (1, 1, 2, 2).\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes (1, 2, 2, 3).\n    *   Energy = $E_1 + (2 \\times E_2) + E_3 = E + (2 \\times 4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes (1, 1, 3, 3).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes (1, 1, 2, 4).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + E_2 + E_4 = (2 \\times E) + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E) to the first excited state (15E), the lowest of these is 18E.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
