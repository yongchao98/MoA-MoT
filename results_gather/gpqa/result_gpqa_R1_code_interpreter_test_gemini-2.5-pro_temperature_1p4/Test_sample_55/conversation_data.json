    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay from the initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. This is a cascade decay that must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The decay happens via electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition between an initial state $|i\\rangle$ and a final state $|f\\rangle$, the following rules must be satisfied:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission, energy must be released, so $n_f < n_i$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$. This implies that the parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules to the First Transition:**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ ($n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$).\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $n_{int} < 3$. All options suggest $n_{int}=2$, which is valid.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l_{int} = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate magnetic quantum number $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply Selection Rules to the Second Transition:**\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|2, 1, m_{int}\\rangle$ (where $m_{int} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n    *   **Final state:** $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ ($n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$).\n    *   Applying the rules:\n        *   $n_f = 1 < n_{int} = 2$. (Valid)\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Valid)\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int}$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m_{int}$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n    *   This confirms that all three cascade paths proposed in the options (A, B, C) are allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    *   **Step 1 Branching Ratio:** We need the probability of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$. This is given by the ratio of the partial decay rate to the total decay rate of the initial state.\n        $P(3s \\to 2p_{m_{int}}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3s \\to 2p_{m_{int}})}{\\Gamma_{tot}(3s)}$\n\n        The transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (its wavefunction is independent of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has no preference for which of the degenerate final substates ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) to decay into. The transition rates must be equal:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\n        The only allowed dipole decay from the 3s state is to a 2p state (since $n$ must decrease and $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$). Thus, the total decay rate is the sum of the rates to these three substates:\n        $\\Gamma_{tot}(3s) = \\sum_{m_{int}=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3s \\to 2p_{m_{int}})$\n\n        Since the three partial rates are equal, each must be one-third of the total rate. Therefore, the branching ratio for the decay into any specific substate $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Step 2 Branching Ratio:** Now we consider the decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$. This is a 2p state. According to the selection rules, it must decay to a state with $n<2$ (so $n=1$) and $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (so $l=0$ or $l=2$). The $n=1$ shell only contains the $l=0$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Therefore, the only possible dipole decay channel for any 2p state is to the 1s state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        This means that once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ states, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with 100% probability (for dipole transitions). The branching ratio for this step is 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:** The probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the path $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P = P(3s \\to 2p_0) \\times P(2p_0 \\to 1s) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) Route is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n    *   B) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   C) Route is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n    *   D) Route is possible, but probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
