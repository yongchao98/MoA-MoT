    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid gives an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H peak implies the protons are equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons that are highly deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks indicates high symmetry.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data perfectly. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene, locked in the *s-cis* conformation necessary for a Diels-Alder reaction. The reacting carbons are C1 and C4, and the CH₂ group at C5 will become the one-carbon bridge in the product.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Because the dienophile can approach the cyclic diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products are formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* adduct, where the substituents on the dienophile (in this case, the anhydride ring) are tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (*endo* Adduct):**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n    *   There are methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and on the alkene carbons (C5, C6).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C2 and C3 positions.\n    *   In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 methylene bridge (*syn* orientation).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the anhydride group. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   Based on the structure and symmetry of the *endo* product, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals and assign the chemical shifts given in the options.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons on the anhydride part of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. The other C7 proton would give a separate signal. They are split into doublets by geminal coupling. Let's call this one **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n    *   Let's compare the key distances in both isomers:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on the same side of the molecule (*syn*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule (*anti*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. No significant NOE is expected. Conversely, in the *exo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons would be closer to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The differentiating cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must connect the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene): These groups are too far apart for a significant NOE.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This NOE would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge): This interaction would likely be present in both isomers, so it's not the differentiating peak.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This interaction is uniquely strong in the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
