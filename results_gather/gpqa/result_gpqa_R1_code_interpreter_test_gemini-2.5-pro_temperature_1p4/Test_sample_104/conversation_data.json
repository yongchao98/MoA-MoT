    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would cause the same brightness dip as the rotational modulation of a star with spots on one hemisphere.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starspot Scenario:**\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing a hemisphere that is fully spotted or one that is clear. We need to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer. This hemisphere is not entirely covered by spots; it has a spot filling factor `f` of 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of its area has the spot temperature (T_spot), and the remaining 80% (or 1-f) has the normal effective temperature (T_eff).\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts.\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude:** The amplitude of the signal is the fractional drop in brightness, which is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n    *   Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Amplitude_spots = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    *   Amplitude_spots = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    *   Amplitude_spots = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴]\n    *   Amplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴\n    *   Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴]\n\n**3. Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario:**\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   **Transit Depth (Amplitude_planet):**\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for R_pl/R_star:**\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\n\n*   Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for the radius ratio `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n*   f = 0.2\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n\nTo get the final value, we take the square root of this expression.\n\n*   R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])\n\nLet's compute the numerical value using a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Star's effective temperature in K\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Spot temperature in K\n\n# Calculate the squared ratio of radii, which equals the flux dip from spots\nr_ratio_squared = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the radius ratio by taking the square root\nr_ratio = math.sqrt(r_ratio_squared)\n\nprint(r_ratio)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.3217911679998188\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the radius ratio `R_pl/R_star` is approximately 0.3218.\n\n**5. Compare with Options:**\n*   A) ~0.11\n*   B) ~0.39\n*   C) ~0.07\n*   D) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D. Note that if one forgets to take the square root, the result would be ~0.104, which is close to option A. This is a common mistake; the question asks for the radius ratio, not the area ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating starspots with the amplitude of the brightness drop caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness of a star is proportional to its flux (F), which, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (F ∝ T⁴). We will compare the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere faces us) to the minimum flux (when the spotted hemisphere faces us).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is fully visible. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n    *   where `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with spots is visible. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor `f` of 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of its surface is at the spot temperature (`T_spot`), and the remaining 80% (1 - f) is at the normal effective temperature (`T_eff`).\n    *   `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Spot Variation (Amplitude_spots):** The amplitude is the fractional change in brightness.\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        `Amplitude_spots = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `Amplitude_spots = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴]`\n        `Amplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Brightness Drop due to a Transiting Exoplanet**\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting drop in brightness, known as the transit depth, is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Planet Transit (Amplitude_planet):**\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n    *   where `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for the desired ratio, `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the radius ratio:\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴])`\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.2`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴])`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.2 * [1 - 0.48225])`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.2 * 0.51775)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
