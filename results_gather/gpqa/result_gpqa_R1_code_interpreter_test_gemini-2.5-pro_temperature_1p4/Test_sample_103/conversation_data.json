    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. A planet and its star orbit their common center of mass. From our line of sight, we observe the star moving towards and away from us, causing a periodic blue-shift and red-shift in its spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    $$ K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} $$\n    This means that the semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    $$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n    We are given the maximum shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n3.  **Express K in terms of Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ can be expressed in terms of the orbital period ($T$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the inclination of the orbit ($i$) relative to our line of sight. The formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, i.e., $m_p \\ll M_{star}$) is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Form a Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the expression for $K$ for each of the two planet-star systems and then take their ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem provides a single numerical answer, which implies a unique solution. This is only possible if the unknown inclination angles are the same, or if their ratio is 1. Thus, we assume $i_1 = i_2$, which means $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the ratio cancel out:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(T_2)^{-1/3}}{(T_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    Inverting both sides gives:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n7.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:** From Step 2, we know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\n    Now, let's compute the numerical value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods, T2/T1, is given by the cube of the inverse ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes, K1/K2.\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts, 5/7.\n\nratio_K1_over_K2 = 5 / 7\nratio_T2_over_T1 = ratio_K1_over_K2**3\n\nprint(ratio_T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 0.3644. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods ($T_2/T_1$) of two exoplanets. Let's break down the physics and the given information.\n\n### 1. The Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe RV method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. The planet and star orbit their common center of mass. This causes the star to \"wobble,\" moving towards and away from an observer on Earth, resulting in a periodic shift in its spectral lines.\n\nThe relationship between the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) and the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is given by the Doppler effect formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observable shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$. Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### 2. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude $K$ is given by the formula (assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$):\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n### 3. Finding the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nLet's write the expression for $K$ for both systems and take their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\nNow, let's use the information given in the problem to simplify this expression:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n*   Since the problem expects a single numerical answer, we assume the unknown orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\nWith these simplifications, most terms cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(T_2)^{-1/3}}{(T_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nWe want to solve for the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$. Substituting this value into our equation:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
