    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and its total energy.**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume the annihilation occurs with the particles essentially at rest.\n    The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n    The rest mass of an antiproton is the same as a proton's, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n    The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton:\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state and its total energy.**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    The rest mass energy of each of these particles is given as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    The total energy of a single final particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n    The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation ($E_i = E_f$).\n    $E_i = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    We must also consider the conservation of momentum. Since the initial particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the four product particles must fly apart with equal speeds to conserve momentum. This means they will share the total final energy equally.\n    So, the energy of each particle A is:\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_i}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n    We know that the total energy of one particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    We can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n    $469.135 \\text{ MeV} = \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Calculate the velocity (v).**\n    The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v/c$. We can rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Now, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# Total initial energy from proton-antiproton annihilation at rest\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The final state has 4 particles (2 A+ and 2 A-).\n# By conservation of energy and momentum, the energy is shared equally.\n# Energy of a single A particle:\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2\n# So, we can find the Lorentz factor gamma.\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# The Lorentz factor is related to velocity (v) by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# We can find beta = v/c from gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n# The velocity is v = beta * c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\nThe computed velocity matches one of the options provided.\n\n<<<D>>>",

    "The initial state of the system is a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The \"slowly moving\" description implies that we can neglect the initial kinetic energy. The total energy of the initial state is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\nThe rest mass of an antiproton is identical to that of a proton.\nTotal initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis energy is converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The rest mass energy of each of these particles is given as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy ($E_{final}$).\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSince the initial system is essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the principle of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The simplest configuration that achieves this is for the four product particles to fly apart with equal speeds, sharing the final energy equally.\n\nEnergy of each particle A ($E_A$):\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\nFor particle A:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n$469.135 \\text{ MeV} = \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow we can find the velocity, $v$, from the Lorentz factor. We will solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
