    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be S. This is the frame in which we want to find the distance traveled.\n    *   Let the ejecta's reference frame be S'.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's frame, S'. A clock on the ejecta measures 50 seconds. This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`), because the clock is at rest relative to the events it's measuring. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n3.  **Apply the concept of Time Dilation.**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in frame S will see the clock in the moving frame S' ticking slower. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (S), `Δt`, is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (S'), `Δt₀`, by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the dilated time (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance (d).**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Compute the final numerical value.**\n    *   We can compute this value using a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # speed in km/s\nt0 = 50    # proper time in s\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# The distance without relativistic effects would be v * t0 = 3,000,000 km.\n# Let's calculate the relativistic distance.\n# d = v * t = v * (gamma * t0)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# d = v * t0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\ndistance = (v * t0) / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n**Logical shortcut:**\nThe non-relativistic distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option A). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (50 s). Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be greater than 3,000,000 km. Only option D is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's own reference frame (let's call it S'). This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the given variables:**\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames (ejecta S' and Galaxy S) is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time interval measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame, S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n\n**2. Determine what needs to be calculated:**\n*   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n*   The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n**3. Apply the Time Dilation formula:**\n*   According to special relativity, an observer in frame S will see the clock in the moving frame S' run slower. The time measured in the stationary frame `Δt` is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`.\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n*   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n*   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the time interval in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n*   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n*   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n*   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n*   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation: `3061862.178478973` km.\n\nThis value is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n\n**7. Compare with the options:**\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\n**Logical Check:**\nIf we ignored relativity, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option A). Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be longer than the 50 seconds measured on the ejecta. Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (`d = v * Δt`) must be greater than 3,000,000 km. Only option D is greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
