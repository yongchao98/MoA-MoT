    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State and the Measurement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in p-orbitals, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state represented by the ket $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $L^2$ (with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$) and $L_z$ (with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$).\n\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of *each electron individually*. We are measuring the observables $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of this measurement are the *uncoupled* basis states, denoted by $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ or more simply $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are known.\n\n### **2. Identify the Desired Final State**\n\n*   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l \\hbar$. So, we are looking for the outcome where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n*   The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n### **3. Relate the Initial and Final States using the Conservation Principle**\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components:\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n\nThe corresponding quantum numbers must also add up:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n*   In our initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This value is definite. Any measurement of the system's total z-component of angular momentum will yield $-1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n*   The desired final state is the one where we measure $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. For this specific outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n    $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\n*   We see a contradiction. The initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m=-1$, but the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a total z-component of -2. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the measurement process, it is impossible for a system with $m=-1$ to be found in a state with a total z-component of -2.\n\n### **4. Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|\\phi\\rangle$ after starting from the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product:\n$P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2$\n\n$P = |\\langle l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1 | l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe inner product term, $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$, is known as a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**. These coefficients are used to transform between the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\nA crucial property (or selection rule) for a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient to be non-zero is that $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nLet's check this rule for our specific case:\n*   $m = -1$ (from the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$)\n*   $m_{l1} = -1$ (from the desired outcome)\n*   $m_{l2} = -1$ (from the desired outcome)\n\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nTo confirm this with a code-based calculation:\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Define the quantum numbers for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n# <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\nl1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nl2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n# The `doit()` method evaluates it.\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1> is {cg_coefficient}.\")\nprint(f\"The probability is {probability}.\")\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1> is 0.\nThe probability is 0.\n```\n\nThe code confirms that the coefficient is zero, leading to a probability of zero.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe measurement outcome of getting eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is physically impossible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a total $m=-1$, while the proposed outcome has a total $m_{l1}+m_{l2} = -2$. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons and finding the specific outcome where both are $-\\hbar$.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The system is initially in a *coupled angular momentum state* given by $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is definitively $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The measurement performed is on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of these operators, which are $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$.\n\n    *   The question asks for the probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state in the *uncoupled basis* where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. Let's call this state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Principle:**\n    A fundamental principle of angular momentum is that the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. This applies to the operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$) and their corresponding quantum numbers ($m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$).\n\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This value is conserved. Any possible outcome of the measurement of individual components must sum up to this total value.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    *   We see a contradiction: The initial state has a total $m=-1$, but the desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m_{total} = -2$. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible for a system with $m=-1$ to be found in a configuration where the sum of its parts is -2.\n\n3.  **Formal Probability Calculation:**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, to be in the state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2$\n\n    In our notation, this is:\n    $P = |\\langle l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n    This inner product is known as a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**. A crucial selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    In our case:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    *   $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\n    Since $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Verification with Python:**\n    We can use a scientific library like `sympy` to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and confirm our reasoning.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# The problem is to find the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1\n# when the system is in the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>.\n# This probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m>.\n\nl1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nl2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n# The selection rule m = m1 + m2 is violated (-1 != -1 + -1),\n# so we expect the coefficient to be 0.\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(probability)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome for a two-electron system.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Initial State of the System:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for electron 1 and 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means a measurement of the total angular momentum z-component, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Measurement and Desired Outcome:** A measurement is made on the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the specific outcomes:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 is $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 is $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This conservation law must hold for their corresponding quantum numbers as well:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Applying the Conservation Law:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have a conflict. The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m=-1$, but the desired final state corresponds to a total magnetic quantum number of -2. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved ($m$ must equal $m_{l1} + m_{l2}$), it is impossible for the system in the state with $m=-1$ to be found in a state where the sum of its components is -2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero. The code execution confirms this by calculating the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero, leading to a zero probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
