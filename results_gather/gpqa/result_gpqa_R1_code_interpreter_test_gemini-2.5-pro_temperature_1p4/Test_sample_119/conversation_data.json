    "Here is the reasoning process to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (plx).\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Uniform stellar distribution:** This assumption means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the stellar number density (ρ), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (p or plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is `p = 1/d`, where `d` is typically measured in parsecs and `p` in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:**\n    *   We need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Mathematically, this is the derivative `dN/dp`, where `N` is the number of stars and `p` is the parallax. This quantity tells us how the density of stars changes as we look at different parallax values.\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth/Sun).\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`. The thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant stellar number density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n\n4.  **Convert from distance (d) to parallax (p):**\n    *   Our goal is to express `dN` in terms of `p` and `dp`. We use the relationship `d = 1/p`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/p` into the expression for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/p)² * dd`\n    *   Next, we need to relate the distance interval `dd` to the corresponding parallax interval `dp`. We do this by differentiating `d = 1/p` with respect to `p`:\n        `dd/dp = d(1/p)/dp = -1/p²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = -dp/p²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`p`) decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we use `|dd| = dp/p²`. A positive interval `dp` corresponds to a shell of thickness `dd`.\n\n5.  **Derive the final relationship:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `dd` into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/p)² * (dp/p²) `\n    *   Combine the terms involving `p`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/p⁴) * dp`\n    *   Now, we can find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/dp`, by dividing both sides by `dp`:\n        `dN/dp = 4πρ / p⁴`\n\n6.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   In the final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/p⁴`.\n    *   `dN/dp ∝ 1/p⁴` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n    *   This means that if you were to create a histogram of stars based on their parallax, the number of stars found in a bin at parallax `p` would be proportional to `1/p⁴`. The number of stars drops very steeply as parallax increases (i.e., as we look at closer stars).\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   The derived relationship `~ 1/plx⁴` corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
