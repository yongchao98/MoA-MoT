    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to the carbonyl group.\n    2.  **Role of reactants:**\n        *   **butan-2-one (CH₃COCH₂CH₃):** This is the electrophilic substrate. The carbonyl carbon is partially positive and is susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n        *   **NaCN:** This provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    3.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This addition breaks the pi bond of the carbonyl group, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n        *   This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    4.  **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Looking at the options for A: H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃.\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion):** This is the chemical species present in an acidic aqueous solution. It is an excellent proton donor. Protonating the alkoxide with H₃O⁺ yields the desired cyanohydrin.\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent also reacts with ketones in a nucleophilic addition to form a bisulfite addition product (a salt of a hydroxysulfonic acid). It is not used to provide a proton in a separate cyanohydrin formation reaction. While the cyanohydrin reaction can be acid-catalyzed (generating some HCN from NaCN + Acid), the final step explicitly requires a proton source to quench the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is the correct choice to represent the protonation step.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group and the aromatic rings) remains unchanged. This transformation is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Role of reactants:**\n        *   **2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile:** This is the starting material, a nitrile.\n        *   **H₂O:** Water is required for the hydrolysis.\n    3.  **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, often with heat. The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN + OH⁻ + H₂O → R-COO⁻ + NH₃ (followed by an acidic workup to get R-COOH)\n    4.  **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   Looking at the options for B: CH₃COOH and HCl.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it can theoretically catalyze the reaction, the hydrolysis of a nitrile is a difficult reaction and typically requires a much stronger acid (or base) to proceed at a reasonable rate.\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the effective hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A must be a proton source, which is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst for hydrolysis, which is HCl.\n    *   Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
