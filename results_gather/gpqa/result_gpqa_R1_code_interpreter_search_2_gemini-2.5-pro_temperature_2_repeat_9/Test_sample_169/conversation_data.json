    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The electron's spin state is given by the vector `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]`. This is a ket vector.\n    *   The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`.\n    *   The Pauli-Y matrix, `σ_y`, is `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Expectation Value:**\n    The expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n    `⟨A⟩ = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    In our case, `A` is `S_y`, so we need to calculate:\n    `⟨S_y⟩ = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Step 3a: Determine the bra vector `⟨ψ|`.**\n        The bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|ψ⟩`.\n        Ket vector: `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n        The transpose is `[3i, 4]`.\n        The complex conjugate of the transpose is `[-3i, 4]`.\n        So, `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.**\n        This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\n        Since `i² = -1`, we have:\n        `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n    *   **Step 3c: Calculate the term `S_y|ψ⟩`.**\n        First, apply the `σ_y` matrix to `|ψ⟩`:\n        `σ_y|ψ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n        `σ_y|ψ⟩ = [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]^T`\n        `σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n        `σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-4i, -3]^T`\n        Now, include the `ħ/2` factor:\n        `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n\n    *   **Step 3d: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.**\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * ((ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T)`\n        We can take the constant `ħ/2` out:\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ([-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T)`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]`\n        `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ`.\n\n    *   **Step 3e: Calculate the final expectation value `⟨S_y⟩`.**\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n        `⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated expectation value is `-12ħ/25`.

    "**1. State the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, denoted as `⟨S_y⟩`, for a given quantum spin state.\n\n**2. Recall the Fundamental Formula:**\nThe expectation value of any operator `Â` for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`⟨Â⟩ = <ψ|Â|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nIn this problem, the operator `Â` is `S_y`, and the state is `|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)`.\n\n**3. Define the Components:**\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant.\n*   The Pauli-Y matrix, `σ_y`, is given as `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The ket vector (column vector) for the state is `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`.\n*   The bra vector (row vector) `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`.\n    *   Transpose: `[3i, 4]`\n    *   Complex Conjugate: `[-3i, 4]`\n    *   So, `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation in Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the denominator).**\n    This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(i²) + 16`\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the term `S_y|ψ⟩`.**\n    First, we apply the `σ_y` matrix to the `|ψ⟩` vector, and then multiply by `ħ/2`.\n    `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n    `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]^T`\n    `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n    `S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.**\n    Now, we take the inner product of the bra `⟨ψ|` with the result from the previous step.\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T )`\n    We can pull the constant `ħ/2` out of the product.\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T )`\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]`\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 12(i²) - 12 ]`\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 12(-1) - 12 ]`\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -24 ]`\n    `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = -12ħ`\n\n*   **Step 4d: Assemble the final expectation value `⟨S_y⟩`.**\n    `⟨S_y⟩ = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    `⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`\n\n**5.
