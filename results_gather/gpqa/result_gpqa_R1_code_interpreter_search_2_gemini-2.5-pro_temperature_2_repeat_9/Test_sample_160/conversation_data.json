    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:** The question compares two different types of mean free path (MFP) in the same environment (a vacuum chamber with a specific density of gas molecules).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with *other gas molecules*.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron colliding with those same gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It's inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    When considering the MFP of a gas molecule within a gas of identical molecules, we must account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving. Kinetic theory shows that this introduces a factor of the square root of 2 to account for the average relative velocity between molecules.\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n    Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules and `σ_gas-gas` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (related to the molecule's diameter).\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    Now consider the MFP of an electron from the beam. The electron is accelerated by 1000 kV, meaning it has extremely high energy and velocity (a significant fraction of the speed of light). Compared to this, the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible. The gas molecules can be considered stationary targets from the electron's perspective. Therefore, the √2 factor from relative molecular motion does not apply.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_e-gas):**\n    This is the key to the problem. We need to compare the \"size\" of the target as seen by two different projectiles.\n    *   **Projectile 1 (Gas Molecule):** A gas molecule is a relatively large object with an electron cloud. When it approaches another gas molecule, they interact at a distance defined by their kinetic radii. Let's call this cross-section σ_gg.\n    *   **Projectile 2 (High-Energy Electron):** An electron is a fundamental particle, much smaller than a gas molecule. A high-energy electron can pass through the \"empty space\" of an atom's electron cloud without significant interaction. A \"collision\" or \"scattering event\" for a high-energy electron is a less frequent event than a \"collision\" between two larger gas molecules. Therefore, the effective scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules.\n    *   Conclusion: σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings to Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   We have λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas-gas) / σ_e-gas\n\n    Since we established that σ_e-gas is smaller than σ_gas-gas, the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number > 1).\n    *   This means λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. Our analysis shows λ2/λ1 should be greater than 1.414.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. A smaller cross-section means a *longer* mean free path.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because both the projectile and the physics of the collision (relative motion) are different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Our detailed physical analysis shows λ2/λ1 > 1.414, which satisfies the condition \">=\" 1.22.\n\n    ***Simplified Check:*** Even if one makes the simplifying (and physically inaccurate) assumption that the cross-sections are equal (σ_e-gas = σ_gas-gas), the ratio would be:\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    This simplified result also falls squarely into option D. Both the simple and the more rigorous physical analyses point to the same answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
