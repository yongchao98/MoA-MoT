    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that has a \"spheroid in shape\" and a \"symmetry axis along the z-axis\". This oscillation produces electromagnetic radiation. We need to determine two properties of this radiation in the far-field (radiation zone):\n1.  The fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30° with the z-axis.\n2.  A possible functional dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength λ.\n\nThe description suggests a source with axial symmetry. In electromagnetism, radiating sources are classified by a multipole expansion: electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, etc. We should analyze the simplest and most common cases first.\n\n### 2. Modeling the Radiating Source\n\n**Model 1: Electric Dipole Radiation (Simplest Model)**\n\n*   The most fundamental type of radiation comes from an oscillating electric dipole. An \"oscillating charge distribution\" can be most simply modeled as an oscillating electric dipole moment, **p**, oriented along the symmetry axis (z-axis). This could be caused by a separation of positive and negative charges oscillating along the z-axis. The \"spheroid shape\" can be interpreted as the shape of the object containing these charges.\n*   The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = K * ω⁴ * sin²(θ)\n    ```\n    where K is a constant depending on the dipole moment amplitude and physical constants, ω is the angular frequency, and θ is the angle with the z-axis.\n\n**Model 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation (Alternative Model)**\n\n*   The phrasing \"spheroid in shape\" could specifically hint at an oscillation of the shape itself (e.g., a charged sphere oscillating between a prolate and oblate spheroid). Such an oscillation, if it preserves the center of charge, would have a zero dipole moment but a time-varying electric quadrupole moment. This is the next simplest radiating multipole after the dipole.\n*   For a linear electric quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by:\n    ```\n    dP/dΩ = K' * ω⁶ * sin²(θ)cos²(θ)\n    ```\n    where K' is another constant.\n\n**Which model to choose?**\nIn the absence of information forcing the dipole moment to be zero, the dipole radiation term is dominant. The power radiated by successive multipoles typically falls off rapidly with the ratio of the source size to the wavelength. Therefore, the most reasonable and standard assumption is to consider the lowest-order, non-zero multipole, which is the dipole. We will proceed with the electric dipole model.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Wavelength Dependence\n\n*   The radiated power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, is dP/dΩ.\n*   From the dipole model formula, `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n*   The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where c is the speed of light.\n*   Therefore, `ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n*   So, a possible form for the dependence on λ is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis eliminates options A (λ⁻³) and D (λ⁻⁶). The answer must be either B or C.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Angular Fraction\n\n*   The angular dependence from the dipole model is `sin²(θ)`.\n*   The function `f` is `f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴ * sin²(θ)`.\n*   The maximum power, A, is radiated when the angular part, `sin²(θ)`, is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   So, `A ∝ λ⁻⁴ * (1)`.\n*   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P(30°)`.\n*   `P(30°) ∝ λ⁻⁴ * sin²(30°)`.\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   So, `P(30°) ∝ λ⁻⁴ * (1/4)`.\n*   The fraction of the maximum power A is the ratio `P(30°) / A`:\n    ```\n    Fraction = [λ⁻⁴ * (1/4)] / [λ⁻⁴ * (1)] = 1/4\n    ```\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBased on the dominant electric dipole radiation model, the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30° is **1/4**, and the power dependence on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we get: (Fraction = 1/4, form = λ⁻⁴).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's briefly check if the alternative (quadrupole) model matches any option.\n*   λ dependence: `ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`.\n*   Angular dependence: `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. Maximum is at `θ = 45°`, where `sin²(45)cos²(45) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4`.\n*   Value at `θ = 30°` is `sin²(30)cos²(30) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`.\n*   Fraction = (Value at 30°)/(Max Value) = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4.\n*   This gives (Fraction = 3/4, form = λ⁻⁶), which matches option D.\n\nSince the problem gives a choice, and both primary models (dipole and quadrupole) correspond to an option, we rely on the principle that dipole radiation is the most fundamental and dominant mechanism unless specified otherwise. Hence, the dipole model is the most appropriate interpretation.\n\nThe final answer is determined by the results from the electric dipole radiation model.\n\n*   Fraction: 1/4\n*   Possible form of f: λ⁻⁴\n\n<<<C>>>"
