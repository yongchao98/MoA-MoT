    "*   **1. Analyze the question:** The question asks which fundamental symmetries must be respected by *all* operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n*   **2. Define SMEFT:** The SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators built from the SM fields. It is an effective field theory, meaning it's an approximation of a more fundamental theory at some higher energy scale, Λ. A crucial assumption in the construction of the standard SMEFT is that it is a local, relativistic quantum field theory.\n\n*   **3. Evaluate each symmetry:**\n    *   **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** The SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators added to the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). This is a fundamental requirement of any relativistic quantum field theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n    *   **Poincaré symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations *plus* spacetime translations. Invariance under spacetime translations is a fundamental assumption of the SMEFT (and the SM), leading to the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the SMEFT respects both Lorentz transformations and translations, it must respect Poincaré symmetry.\n    *   **CP symmetry (3):** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is already known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically by the weak interaction via the complex phase in the CKM matrix. The SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, there is no requirement for all SMEFT operators to be CP-invariant. In fact, searching for the effects of such operators is a major goal of precision experiments. So, CP symmetry is *not* necessarily respected.\n    *   **CPT symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is automatically symmetric under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since the standard SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **4. Synthesize the findings:**\n    *   Lorentz symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n    *   Poincaré symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n    *   CP symmetry (3) **does not** need to be respected.\n    *   CPT symmetry (4) **must** be respected.\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:** The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n*   **6. Match with options:**\n    *   A) 1,3,4 - Incorrect (includes CP)\n    *   B) 1,2,4 - Correct\n    *   C) 1,2 - Incorrect (omits CPT)\n    *   D) 3,4 - Incorrect (includes CP and omits Lorentz/Poincaré)\n\n<<<B>>>"
