    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3.1:1) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which are two mass units apart, creating this characteristic pattern.\n\nSo, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that signifies the O-H stretching vibration within a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl region and its position is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (anything > 10 ppm) is almost always from a **carboxylic acid proton (-COO H)**. It's a singlet (s) because it typically does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern is crucial:\n    *   There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H).\n    *   The signals are two distinct doublets (d).\n    *   This simple \"doublet of doublets\" pattern for 4 aromatic protons is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent and the two on the other side equivalent, leading to this clean splitting pattern.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **Structure Elements:** From the spectra, we have identified a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a chlorine atom (-Cl), and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:** The only way to assemble these pieces is to have the -COOH group and the -Cl group attached to a benzene ring in the 1 and 4 positions. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   **Let's check the options:**\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: MW of 156 (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂), contains Cl, is a carboxylic acid, and has a para-substituted ring.\n    *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is an ortho-substituted isomer. While it has the right MW and functional groups, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the characteristic broad IR absorption or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
