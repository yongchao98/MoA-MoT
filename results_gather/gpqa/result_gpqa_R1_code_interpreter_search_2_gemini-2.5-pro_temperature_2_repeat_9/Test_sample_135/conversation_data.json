    "This problem requires us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f(r)` over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field is given as:\n- Magnitude: `|f| = 1/r^2`\n- Direction: Radially outward from the origin.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, this vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the integral `I = ∫_V (∇.f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and the enclosing surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\n1.  **Evaluate the vector field `f` on the surface `S`:**\n    On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n2.  **Define the differential surface element `dS`:**\n    For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` points radially outward. Thus, its direction is `r_hat`. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n3.  **Calculate the dot product `f . dS`:**\n    `f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] . [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **Integrate over the entire surface `S`:**\n    The surface integral is taken over the full range of the spherical angles: `θ` from 0 to `π`, and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's perform the integration step-by-step:\n    -   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    -   Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from φ=0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is `4π`.\n\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Important Note on the Singularity:**\nOne might be tempted to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly. In spherical coordinates, for a purely radial field `f = f_r(r) * r_hat`, the divergence is `∇.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * f_r)`.\nFor our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`, so:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * d/dr (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * d/dr (1) = 0`\nIf the divergence were zero everywhere inside the volume, the integral would be zero. However, the vector field `f` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. The calculation `∇.f = 0` is only valid for `r ≠ 0`.\nThe Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this situation. The non-zero flux (`4π`) coming out of the sphere indicates the presence of a \"source\" at the origin. The volume integral of the divergence measures the total strength of this source. The divergence at the origin is not zero; it is a Dirac delta function, specifically `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nThe result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 1\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
