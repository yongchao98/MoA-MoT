    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that underpin the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concept**: The question is about the \"impulse approximation\". The key phrase provided is that in this approximation, \"nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons\". I need to analyze what conditions must be met for this to be a valid simplification.\n\n2.  **Analyze \"behaving like a free nucleon\"**:\n    *   A \"free nucleon\" is one that is not interacting with other nucleons. It is not bound within a nuclear potential.\n    *   The interaction in question is typically a high-energy scattering event (e.g., an electron or neutrino hitting the nucleus). These interactions are very fast.\n    *   The approximation's name, \"impulse,\" suggests a very short, sudden event. In mechanics, an impulse (a large force over a short time) changes an object's momentum without us needing to consider other, slower-acting forces (like friction or gravity) *during* the impulse.\n    *   Applying this analogy to the nucleus: the external probe delivers an \"impulse\" to one nucleon. The interaction is assumed to happen so quickly that the strong nuclear forces binding that nucleon to its neighbors don't have time to act. Therefore, for that brief instant, the nucleon reacts as if it were free.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Statement against this Understanding**:\n\n    *   **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n        *   This is the \"single nucleon\" part of the approximation. If the probe could interact with two or more nucleons simultaneously (via what are called meson-exchange currents or two-body currents), the picture would be much more complicated. The very foundation of the impulse approximation is to simplify the complex many-body problem into a sum of single-body events. So, the interaction must be localized to a single nucleon. This statement is essential.\n\n    *   **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n        *   This relates to what happens before and after the core interaction. If the incoming probe is scattered or absorbed by another nucleon on its way *to* the target nucleon, the energy and momentum of the interaction are not what we think they are. Similarly, if the struck nucleon (or the scattered probe) then collides with other nucleons on its way *out* of the nucleus (a process called \"final-state interactions\" or FSI), the final measured momentum and energy won't reflect the initial, primary interaction. To treat the event as a clean, single-nucleon interaction, we must assume the rest of the nucleus is effectively transparent to the particles involved. This statement is essential.\n\n    *   **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n        *   This statement deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a statement about how the *nucleon as an entity* behaves within the *nucleus*. It is a separate question of how to model the nucleon's internal structure (its \"form factors\" or \"structure functions\"). We can use the impulse approximation in both non-relativistic nuclear models and fully relativistic ones where the internal quarks are highly relativistic (as in deep inelastic scattering). Therefore, assuming the quarks are non-relativistic is *not* a general requirement for the impulse approximation itself. It might be an additional approximation used in a specific *model* that also employs the impulse approximation, but it's not a core tenet of the IA itself. This statement is likely not essential.\n\n    *   **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n        *   This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept, as discussed in step 2. We assume the interaction is instantaneous compared to the timescale of nuclear binding forces. The nucleon is bound *before* and *after* the hit, but *during* the brief moment of interaction, it behaves as if it's free from that potential. This is precisely what allows us to use the physics of free-nucleon scattering to describe the event. This statement is essential.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**:\n    *   Statements 1, 2, and 4 are all direct consequences and necessary conditions for the validity of the impulse approximation.\n    *   Statement 1 ensures the target is a single nucleon.\n    *   Statement 4 ensures that during the interaction, this nucleon behaves as if it's free.\n    *   Statement 2 ensures that the entire process (probe in, interaction, products out) is not contaminated by other interactions with the nuclear medium.\n    *   Statement 3 is about a different level of physics (sub-nucleonic structure) and is not a core requirement of the IA.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options**:\n    *   The required assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
