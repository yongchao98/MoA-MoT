    "This is a classic problem in chemical analysis, particularly in the context of peptide chemistry. Let's break down the evidence provided and evaluate the possible explanations.\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Observation:** One alpha-proton shows two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (summing to 1H). Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific alpha-proton. Since the integrals are equal, the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The fact that other parts of the spectrum are \"consistent with the expected molecule\" suggests the two species are very closely related in structure.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Analysis (at elevated temperature):**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities and the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecular weight of the target compound.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks in the chromatogram means there are two different compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity). The fact that they have the same mass spectrum confirms they are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass). The \"elevated temperature\" condition is a key detail. It often serves to speed up the interconversion of conformational isomers (rotamers). If the two species were rapidly interconverting rotamers, they would likely merge into a single peak on the LC at high temperatures. Since they remain as two distinct peaks, they must be stable, non-interconverting stereoisomers.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is also unlikely. A \"double coupled\" product (e.g., an extra amino acid added) would result in a molecule with a higher mass. This contradicts the LC-MS data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   **Enantiomers** are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In standard (achiral) NMR, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical spectra. You would see only one set of peaks.\n    *   In standard (achiral) LC, enantiomers co-elute and cannot be separated. You would see only one peak.\n    *   Therefore, this explanation does not fit the data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the isomers differ in configuration at one or more (but not all) of those centers. A common example in peptide synthesis is the epimerization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during a coupling reaction, converting an L-amino acid to a D-amino acid within the peptide chain. For instance, a mixture of L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe would be a pair of diastereomers.\n    *   **NMR:** Diastereomers are distinct chemical entities and have different physical properties. Thus, they will have different NMR spectra. Corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have slightly different chemical shifts, leading to the observed \"doubled\" peaks. A 1:1 mixture would give peaks of equal intensity, which matches the observation.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties (shape, polarity), they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would result in two peaks, as observed. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which explains why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if reaction conditions cause epimerization at one of the chiral centers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
