    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the hydrogen-bonded O-H group found in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Alcohols also show O-H stretches, but they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Combined with the broad O-H peak, a carboxylic acid (which has its C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is the most likely functional group.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate its mass: Carbon (12.01) + Oxygen (16.00) + Oxygen (16.00) + Hydrogen (1.01) ≈ 45. This mass corresponds to the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. This is extremely strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   A molecule with a carboxylic acid group must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n    *   We are now left with A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   The functional groups we've identified require a specific DoU:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2 (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) or a cyclic ester, but it cannot contain *both* a C=O and a C=C bond. This contradicts our data.\n        *   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The chemical formula must contain two oxygens and have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies all of these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>"
