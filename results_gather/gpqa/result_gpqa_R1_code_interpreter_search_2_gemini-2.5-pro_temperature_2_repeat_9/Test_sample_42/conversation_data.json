    "This problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. The solution involves a systematic approach: drawing the structure based on the description, identifying the principal functional group, correctly numbering the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules, and then assembling the name by alphabetizing the substituents.\n\n**1. Drawing the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Principal Group & Parent Name:** The highest priority functional group is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Therefore, the molecule is a derivative of benzoic acid, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n*   **Placing Substituents:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are on {C2, C6}.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, {-CHO, -CN} are on {C3, C5}.\n    *   The problem also states that the carbaldehyde, cyano, and carboxylic acid groups are all *meta* to one another. Placing them at C1, C3, and C5 satisfies this condition.\n    *   **Crucial Clues for final placement:**\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) is *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   The methoxy (-OCH3) is *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN).\n\n*   **Deducing the final arrangement:**\n    1.  We have -OCH3 at C4. For it to be ortho to -CN, the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n    2.  Let's test placing -CN at C3. For the -OH group to be ortho to this -CN at C3, it must be at C2 or C4. It cannot be C4 (which is -OCH3), so -OH must be at C2.\n    3.  This arrangement places -OH at C2. This is consistent with it being ortho to the -COOH group at C1.\n    4.  If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho substituent, -N(CH3)2, must be at C6.\n    5.  If -CN is at C3, then the other meta substituent, -CHO, must be at C5.\n\n*   **Let's check the resulting structure (Structure A):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n    *   Does this structure fit all the initial conditions? Yes, it does.\n\n*   **What if we placed -CN at C5 initially?** This would lead to -OH at C6, -N(CH3)2 at C2, and -CHO at C3. This second structure (Structure B) also fits all the textual descriptions.\n\n**2. Applying IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description, which correspond to the two ways of numbering the ring from C1 (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). IUPAC rules provide a tie-breaker.\n\n*   **Rule 1:** The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   **Rule 2:** Number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers). In both possible arrangements, the substituents occupy positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} in both cases. This is a tie.\n*   **Rule 3 (Tie-breaker):** When there is a tie in locant sets, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Alphabetizing the Substituents**\n\nThe substituents must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. Let's list them:\n*   **c**yano (-CN)\n*   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n*   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n*   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, the numbering scheme that assigns the lower number to the cyano group is the correct one.\n\n*   In **Structure A** (from step 1, C2 is -OH), the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In **Structure B** (C2 is -N(CH3)2), the cyano group would be at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme that results in Structure A is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Name**\n\nUsing the positions from the correct structure (Structure A) and arranging the substituents alphabetically:\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   Parent Name: **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
