    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The question describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via \"two dipole transitions,\" which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    Initial state: $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$\n    Final state: $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$\n    Intermediate state: $|k\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n    The process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$ can be any integer. For decay, $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Energy must decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - l' = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$. This is also consistent.\n    *   Combining the conditions on $n'$, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   This gives three possible decay routes:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step, because once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), its only allowed dipole decay path is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s level). So the probability of the second step is 1. The total probability of the route is just the probability of the first step occurring.\n\n    *   The probability of a specific decay channel is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. The total decay rate from the initial state $|i\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states $|k\\rangle$.\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_k \\Gamma_{i \\rightarrow k}$\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) for a specific transition $i \\rightarrow k_j$ is:\n        $P(i \\rightarrow k_j) = \\frac{\\Gamma_{i \\rightarrow k_j}}{\\Gamma_{total}}$\n    *   The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\rightarrow k}$ is proportional to $|\\langle k | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n        $\\Gamma(i \\rightarrow k) \\propto |\\langle k|x|i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle k|y|i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle k|z|i \\rangle|^2$\n    *   Our initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, which is an s-state and is spherically symmetric. The interaction for spontaneous emission, when averaged over all possible photon emission directions and polarizations, is isotropic.\n    *   Because both the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, there should be no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. This means the probability of transitioning to any of the $m'$ sublevels of the $l'=1$ state should be equal.\n    *   So, we expect:\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n    *   Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_0$. The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$\n    *   The probability for any one of these specific decay channels is:\n        $P = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All three possible decay routes are allowed by the selection rules, and each has a probability of $1/3$. Now we check the given options.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) ...and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) ...and $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) ...and $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect probability.\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid decay route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
