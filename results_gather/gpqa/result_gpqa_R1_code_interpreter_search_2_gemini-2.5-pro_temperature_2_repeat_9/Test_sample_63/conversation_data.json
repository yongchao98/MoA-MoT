    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial conditions:**\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means `moles(A) = moles(B) = n`.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is `mass(A) + mass(B) = 7.20 g`.\n    *   In terms of molar masses (`M_A`, `M_B`): `n * M_A + n * M_B = n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g`.\n    *   The salts decompose completely into a mixture of gases upon heating, with no solid or liquid residue.\n\n2.  **Analyze the decomposition products:**\n    The gaseous mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = `3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol`.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The problem states its weight *did not change*, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO): `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of atomic oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = `0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, moles of O₂ gas = `0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol`.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol`.\n        *   Gas C is inert to water absorption, acidic gas reaction, and hot copper. This strongly suggests it is nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n3.  **Verify Conservation of Mass and Identify Reactants:**\n    *   Total mass of gaseous products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass(O₂) = `0.025 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.80 g`.\n    *   Mass(N₂) = `0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.80 g`.\n    *   Total product mass = `3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g`.\n    *   This total mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming that H₂O, O₂, and N₂ are the only products.\n\n    *   The presence of N, H, and O in the products implies the original salts contained these elements. Since they are salts and produce H₂O and N₂ upon heating, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions. The two most common examples that fit the product profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis:**\n    Let's assume Salt A is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let `n` be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n    *   **Decomposition of A:** `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        From `n` moles of A, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Decomposition of B:** `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`. For `n` moles of B, the reaction is `nNH₄NO₃(s) → nN₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`.\n        From `n` moles of B, we get `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n    *   **Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n        *   Total N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`.\n        *   Total O₂ = `0` (from A) + `0.5n` (from B) = `0.5n`.\n        *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`.\n\n    *   **Compare with experimental results:**\n        *   `Total N₂ = 0.10 mol`  => `2n = 0.10` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   `Total O₂ = 0.025 mol` => `0.5n = 0.025` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   `Total H₂O = 0.20 mol`  => `4n = 0.20`  => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   All calculations consistently yield `n = 0.05 mol`, which strongly validates our assumption that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n5.  **Final Mass Check:**\n    *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃) = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total initial mass = `n * (M_A + M_B) = 0.05 * (64 + 80) = 0.05 * 144 = 7.20 g`.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass, confirming the identities of the salts.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 nitrogen atoms + 4 hydrogen atoms + 2 oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 nitrogen atoms + 4 hydrogen atoms + 3 oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# The molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18 g/mol.\n# The mass increase in tube #1 is 3.60 g.\nmoles_H2O = 3.60 / 18\n# The mass increase in tube #3 is due to oxygen (O).

    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the chemical formulas of two salts, A and B, and then calculate the total number of atoms in their respective formula units.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial Information:**\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   Total mass of the mixture = 7.20 g. So, `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20`, where `M_A` and `M_B` are the molar masses of A and B. This simplifies to `n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20`.\n    *   The mixture decomposes completely upon heating to 200°C into only gaseous products.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Gas Analysis Process and Products:** The gaseous mixture is passed through three sequential traps.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / Molar Mass` = `3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol` = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ by forming a precipitate.\n        *   The weight of the tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **No acidic gases were produced.** This rules out salts containing carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or sulfite (SO₃²⁻) that would decompose to CO₂ or SO₂.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n        *   The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bind to the copper. Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen (O) that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = `0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol` = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas that reacted are `0.05 mol O / 2` = 0.025 mol O₂.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passes through all three tubes unreacted is collected.\n        *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to water absorption, reaction with bases, and reaction with hot copper. The most common and logical candidate for such an inert gas from a salt decomposition is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Product Information:**\n    *   The decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.025 mol O₂\n        *   0.10 mol N₂\n    *   Let's check for mass conservation.\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This total mass matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g) perfectly. This confirms that these are the only products.\n\n5.  **Deduce the Composition of the Salts:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Therefore, the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements.\n    *   Since they are salts and produce N₂ and H₂O, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)`. We can simplify this for 1 mole: `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g) + 0.5O₂(g)`\n\n6.  **Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry:**\n    *   We have `n` moles of A (let's say NH₄NO₂) and `n` moles of B (let's say NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Total moles of N₂ produced = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O produced = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`.\n    *   Total moles of O₂ produced = `0` (from A) + `0.5n` (from B) = `0.5n`.\n    *   Now, let's use our experimental product amounts to solve for `n`.\n        *   From N₂: `2n = 0.10 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   From H₂O: `4n = 0.20 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   From O₂: `0.5n = 0.025 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   All three calculations give a consistent value of `n = 0.05 mol`. The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n7.  **Final Step: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₂. Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2N + 4H + 2O = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₃. Atoms = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2N + 4H + 3O = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process has established the identities of the salts\n# and the stoichiometric relationships.

    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's denote the number of moles of each salt as `n`. Therefore, the mass of the mixture can be expressed as:\n`n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g`\n`n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g`\n\nUpon heating, this mixture decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gases produced.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms reacting with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of atomic oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas passed through the tube were half the moles of O atoms: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a desiccant, a basic solution, or hot copper, it is highly likely to be nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original salts.**\n\nThe products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The total mass of the products is `(0.10 mol N₂ * 28 g/mol) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32 g/mol) + (0.20 mol H₂O * 18 g/mol) = 2.80 g + 0.80 g + 3.60 g = 7.20 g`. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that these are the only products.\n\nThe presence of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen in the products indicates that the original salts were ammonium salts of oxyanions of nitrogen. The most common salts that fit this description are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by examining their decomposition reactions:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)` (or per mole: `NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 2H₂O + 0.5O₂`)\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar (`n` moles of each), the total moles of each product would be:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0` (from A) + `0.5n` (from B) = `0.5n`\n\nWe can now use the experimentally determined moles of products to solve for `n`:\n*   From N₂: `2n = 0.10 mol`  ⇒ `n = 0.05 mol`\n*   From O₂: `0.5n = 0.025 mol` ⇒ `n = 0.05 mol`\n*   From H₂O: `4n = 0.20 mol`  ⇒ `n = 0.05 mol`\n\nAll calculations yield a consistent value of `n = 0.05`, confirming that the salts are indeed NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
