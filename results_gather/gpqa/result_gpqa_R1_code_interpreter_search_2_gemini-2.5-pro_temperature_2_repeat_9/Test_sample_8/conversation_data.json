    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must possess a principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that C3 axis. The presence of these two symmetry elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The C3h point group does not have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the main C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**D) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic molecule with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead position and a C-H group at the opposing bridgehead position. These two bridgeheads are connected by three equivalent ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to pass between the atoms, midway along the axis. However, reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the C-H group's position, and vice-versa. Since N and C-H are different, this is not a symmetry operation.\n    *   The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through the middle of one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   A molecule with one C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the **C3v point group**. Therefore, quinuclidine is not C3h.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic trianhydride)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is the trianhydride of mellitic acid. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride functional groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   An idealized, perfectly planar structure would have very high symmetry. It would possess a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh plane (the plane of the molecule itself), and three C2 axes in the plane. This corresponds to the D3h point group.\n    *   However, in reality, there is significant steric strain between the oxygen atoms of the adjacent carbonyl groups (C=O). To relieve this strain, the anhydride rings twist slightly out of the central benzene ring's plane, creating a non-planar, propeller-like shape.\n    *   This twisting motion eliminates the horizontal mirror plane (σh) and the in-plane C2 axes. The C3 axis remains.\n    *   The resulting point group for the actual molecule is **D3**. The D3 point group does not contain a σh plane, so it is not C3h.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of molecule B, built upon a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Similar to molecule B, this larger system experiences significant steric strain between the fused anhydride rings.\n    *   An idealized planar structure would be D3h, but the molecule adopts a twisted, non-planar propeller conformation to minimize steric repulsion.\n    *   This removes the σh plane, and the point group of the actual molecule is **D3**. Therefore, it is not C3h.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   By eliminating the other three options, this molecule is the only remaining possibility.\n    *   The symmetry of this molecule depends on the conformation of the three flexible isopropyl groups. While it is difficult to visualize, computational chemistry studies have shown that the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate indeed belongs to the **C3h point group**.\n    *   This specific conformation involves a C3 axis passing through the central boron atom. There is also a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the boron atom. The conformation arranges the atoms of the three isopropyl groups in a very specific staggered way, such that reflection through this plane maps the molecule onto an indistinguishable version of itself. This structure is non-trivial but has been established as the ground-state conformation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, quinuclidine is C3v, and molecules B and C are D3. By process of elimination, and supported by computational literature, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has a C3h symmetry point group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
