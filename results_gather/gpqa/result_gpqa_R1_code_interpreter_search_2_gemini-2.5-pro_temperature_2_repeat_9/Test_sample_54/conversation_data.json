    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (singlet, s). A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is very characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-COO-).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are coupled to one neighboring proton (doublet, d). This is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, which itself is attached to a single proton (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents a single proton (1H) that is split into a doublet by one neighboring proton and into a quartet by three other neighboring protons (doublet of quartets, dq). This pattern fits a vinyl proton (-CH=) that is adjacent to another vinyl proton and a methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal represents a single proton (1H) coupled to one neighboring proton (doublet, d). The chemical shift indicates it is a vinyl proton. The most crucial piece of information here is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   The singlet at 2.1 ppm confirms the presence of an **acetate group**.\n    *   The remaining signals (a methyl doublet, a vinyl dq, and a vinyl doublet) perfectly describe a **propenyl group** (CH₃-CH=CH-).\n    *   Putting these two fragments together, the compound must be **propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃). This eliminates the \"butenyl acetate\" options (B and C).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The distinction lies in the geometry around the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The stereochemistry is determined by the coupling constant (J value) between the two protons on the double bond (the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   Standard Karplus correlation values for vinyl protons are:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the fragments identified and the large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) indicating a trans double bond, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
