    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). This potential is expressed in polar coordinates (r, θ). To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. The term `kr^2 cos^2(θ)` prevents a simple separation of variables in polar coordinates.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Let's convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can see that x^2 = (r cos(θ))^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ).\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential is now in the form V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n    This represents two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one moving along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. This is also known as a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energy of Each Oscillator:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2 are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2:\n        1/2 mω_x^2 = 2k\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy levels for the x-oscillator are E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x.\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2:\n        1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy levels for the y-oscillator are E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    Since the two oscillators are independent, the total energy E of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the individual oscillators:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n    Substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * (sqrt(k/m))\n\n7.  **Simplify the Total Energy Expression:**\n    Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Distribute the constants inside the bracket:\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    Combine the constant terms:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
