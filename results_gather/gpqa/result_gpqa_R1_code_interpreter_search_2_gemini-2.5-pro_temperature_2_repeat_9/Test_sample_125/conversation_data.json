    "**1. Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5). Its structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that converts ketones into alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H‚Åª) can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the products are a pair of diastereomers:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This will form pentane-2,4-diol (CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent is also achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are enantiomers. Because they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This stereoisomer is a meso compound. It has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It is identical to its mirror image, (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol. A meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**3. Combine Products and Analyze with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture, containing the products from both reactions, has a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column uses a polar stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity).\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II ((3) and (4)) have identical polarities and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound ((5)) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((3) and (4)). It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5H12O2), meaning they have different structures, molecular weights, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II) + 1 (for the meso compound from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all stereoisomers from each other.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers ((1), (2), (3), (4), and (5)).\n    *   A chiral column will resolve diastereomers (1) and (2).\n    *   It will resolve the enantiomers (3) and (4).\n    *   It will separate the meso compound (5) from all the others, as it's a diastereomer to (3) and (4).\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically unique, an ideal chiral separation will produce five distinct peaks.\n    *   Total peaks = 1 (for comp 1) + 1 (for comp 2) + 1 (for comp 3) + 1 (for comp 4) + 1 (for comp 5) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and **4 peaks** in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
