    "This problem involves determining the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\n### **2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nSpin-1/2 particles are fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its principal quantum number *n* and its spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\nThis means that each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up (↑) and one with spin-down (↓).\n\n### **3. Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles (one ↑, one ↓) in this level.\n    The energy contribution from these two particles is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles (one ↑, one ↓) in the next available level.\n    The energy contribution from these two particles is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### **4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting a single particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the next available level, n=3.\n*   **New configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nNow, we calculate the total energy for this configuration:\n*   Energy from n=1 level: $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1^2 E = 2E$.\n*   Energy from n=2 level: $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times 2^2 E = 4E$.\n*   Energy from n=3 level: $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times 3^2 E = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   This is the next smallest single-particle energy jump after the one for the first excited state. (Jump from n=1 to n=3 costs $E_3-E_1 = 9E-1E = 8E$, while the jump from n=2 to n=4 costs $E_4-E_2 = 16E-4E=12E$).\n    *   **New configuration:** 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   **Energy Calculation:**\n        *   Energy from n=1 level: $1 \\times E_1 = 1 \\times 1^2 E = 1E$.\n        *   Energy from n=2 level: $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 2^2 E = 8E$.\n        *   Energy from n=3 level: $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times 3^2 E = 9E$.\n    *   **Total Energy:** $E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   **New configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   **Energy Calculation:**\n        *   Energy from n=1 level: $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1^2 E = 2E$.\n        *   Energy from n=3 level: $2 \\times E_3 = 2 \\times 3^2 E = 18E$.\n    *   **Total Energy:** $E = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies, the lower energy (18E) corresponds to the second excited state.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
