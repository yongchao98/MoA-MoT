    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester.\n\n**2. Determine the Lactone Precursor**\n\nLactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered ring lactone (delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Let's identify the specific precursor for our product.\n\n*   The product name is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   The ring structure is `O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)`. The ethyl group is on C(4), which is the chiral center.\n*   To find the linear hydroxy acid precursor, we mentally break the ester bond between O(1) and C(2). This creates an `-OH` group (from O(1)) and a `-COOH` group (from C(2)).\n*   The carbon chain is `HOOC(from C2)-C(3)-C(4)(Et)-C(5)-C(6)-(OH from O1)`.\n*   Let's number this chain according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (COOH is C1):\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH`\n*   This molecule is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center is C3 of this acid. When it cyclizes, C3 becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during this step.\n\nSo, both reactions must generate `3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid` or a derivative that can cyclize to the lactone.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided list stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name is non-standard, but it is likely referring to a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nLet's draw this structure: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)(*)-CH₂(a)-COOH(a)`.\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). The chiral center (`*`) is at the C3 position.\n\n**4. Analyze the Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces esters much faster than carboxylic acids. It is possible to selectively reduce an ester in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A, an isomer of `(iBu)OOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)-CH₂(a)-COOH`.\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄. It will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reduction Step:** The ester at position `b` is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    `A` + LiBH₄ → `HOCH₂-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)-CH₂(a)-COOH` (This is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`).\n*   **Workup Step:** The acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. To get an (R) product, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)-isomer**.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**6. Trace Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B, an isomer of `(iBu)OOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)-CH₂(a)-COOH`.\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃. It will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`).\n*   **Reduction Step:** The carboxylic acid at position `a` is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    `B` + BH₃ → `(iBu)OOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)-CH₂(a)-CH₂OH` (This is `isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate`).\n*   **Workup Step:** The acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed `-OH` group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone. This pathway also leads to the same lactone structure.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction also does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. To get an (S) product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)-isomer**.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
