    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n\n*   **-cyclohex-..-carboxylic acid**: The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) attached to a cyclohexane ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ring carbon attached to the -COOH group is numbered C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a double bond between C3 and C4 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's assemble the structure and count the atoms:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   Cyclohexane ring: 6 carbons\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH): 1 carbon\n    *   Formyl group (-CHO): 1 carbon\n    *   Vinyl group (-CH=CH2): 2 carbons\n    *   **Total C = 10**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   We start with a cyclohexane ring (C6). Let's count the hydrogens on each carbon of the ring:\n        *   C1: Bonded to -COOH, C2, and C6. It has one hydrogen.\n        *   C2: Bonded to -CHO, C1, and C3. It has one hydrogen.\n        *   C3: Bonded to C2, double-bonded to C4. It has one hydrogen.\n        *   C4: Double-bonded to C3, bonded to C5. It has one hydrogen.\n        *   C5: Bonded to -CH=CH2, C4, and C6. It has one hydrogen.\n        *   C6: Bonded to C1 and C5. It has two hydrogens.\n    *   Total H on the ring = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7.\n    *   Now, let's count the hydrogens on the substituents:\n        *   -COOH: 1 hydrogen\n        *   -CHO: 1 hydrogen\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3 hydrogens\n    *   Total H on substituents = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.\n    *   **Total H = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH): 2 oxygens\n    *   Formyl group (-CHO): 1 oxygen\n    *   **Total O = 3**\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction and Determine the Product**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent capable of reducing most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nLet's see how it acts on the reactant:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to a single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (-C=C-) is reduced to a single bond (-C-C-), converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n\nBased on these transformations, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **3. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nNow let's find the molecular formula of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbons does not change during the reduction. Total C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents. The general formula for a substituted cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   The parent cyclohexane ring has the formula C6H12.\n    *   We have three substituents: two methyl (-CH3) groups and one ethyl (-C2H5) group, which replace hydrogens on the ring.\n    *   The formula is C6H(12-3) + (CH3) + (CH3) + (C2H5) -> C6H9 + C4H11 = **C10H20**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction. Total O = 0.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1  (for a molecule containing only C and H)\n\nUsing the product's molecular formula, **C10H20**:\n*   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n*   IHD = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring) in the product molecule, which is fully saturated and has no double bonds.\n\nAlternatively, we can track the change in IHD:\n*   IHD of reactant (C10H12O3):\n    *   1 ring = 1\n    *   1 C=C in the ring = 1\n    *   1 C=C in the vinyl group = 1\n    *   1 C=O in the -COOH group = 1\n    *   1 C=O in the -CHO group = 1\n    *   Total IHD_reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n*   The reaction reduces all four multiple bonds (two C=C and two C=O). This reduces the IHD by 4.\n*   IHD_product = IHD_reactant - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
