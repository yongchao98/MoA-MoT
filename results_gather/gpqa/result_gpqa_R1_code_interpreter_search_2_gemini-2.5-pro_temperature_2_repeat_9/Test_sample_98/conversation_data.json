    "**1. Deconstruct the Spectral Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   \"No vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities):\n        1.  One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Splitting Patterns**\n\nTo have these specific splitting patterns, we need to find protons (hydrogens attached to a carbon) with very specific sets of neighboring protons. We use the 'n+1' rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (a -CH2 group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 adjacent protons (a -CH3 group).\n\nFor complex splitting, the effects are multiplicative:\n*   A **dtq** means a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving the triplet), and a set of three protons (giving the quartet). Total neighbors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The proton itself is most likely on a CH group.\n*   A **dtt** means a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving one triplet), and another set of two protons (giving the other triplet). Total neighbors = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. The proton itself is also most likely on a CH group.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now examine the structure of each option to see if it can produce both required signals. Note: The written formulas can be slightly ambiguous, so we will interpret them as standard chemical structures.\n\n*   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH\n    ```\n    *   Proton H(c): Coupled to CH2 group (2H → t), H(b) (1H → d), and a CH3 group (3H → q). This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq`, but there is no proton coupled to a CH and two different CH2 groups. So, it cannot produce a `dtt`. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n          C2H5    C2H5\n          |       |\n    CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH\n    ```\n    *   Proton H(c): Coupled to the backbone CH2 group (2H → t), H(b) (1H → d), and its ethyl side chain's CH2 group (2H → t). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtt`, but there is no proton coupled to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3 group simultaneously. So, it cannot produce a `dtq`. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3-CH----CH(b)-CH2-COOH\n         |\n         CH3\n    ```\n    *   Proton H(b): Coupled to the CH2 group (2H → t), the adjacent CH proton of the isopropyl group (1H → d), and its own CH3 group (3H → q). This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq`, but like structure B, it lacks a proton in an environment that would create a `dtt`. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n    The notation `CH3C(...)` is technically incorrect as it overloads the first carbon. This is likely a typo for `CH3CH(...)`. Let's assume the structure is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ```\n          C2H5   C2H5\n          |      |\n    CH3-CH(a)----CH(b)----CH2----COOH\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the two methine protons, H(a) and H(b).\n    *   **Proton H(a) (on C4):** It is coupled to:\n        *   Proton H(b) on C3 (1 neighbor → **doublet, d**).\n        *   The CH2 group of its ethyl side chain (2 neighbors → **triplet, t**).\n        *   The CH3 group at the end of the chain (3 neighbors → **quartet, q**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal!\n    *   **Proton H(b) (on C3):** It is coupled to:\n        *   Proton H(a) on C4 (1 neighbor → **doublet, d**).\n        *   The CH2 group of its ethyl side chain (2 neighbors → **triplet, t**).\n        *   The CH2 group adjacent to the COOH group (2 neighbors → **triplet, t**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
