  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** suggest C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton at such a high chemical shift is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl chain from the remaining signals.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its position next to the aromatic ring (benzylic position) and its multiplicity suggest it's connected to several other protons.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This CH group must be the one at 2.9 ppm. So we have a -CH(CH3)- fragment.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-). It's adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm (making it a triplet) and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **Putting the alkyl group together:** The methine at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring, a methyl group (1.4 ppm), and a methylene group (1.7 ppm). The methylene group is attached to another methyl group (0.9 ppm). This forms a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Product of the Reaction**\n\n    *   **The Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **The Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). It can also reduce alcohols and ketones to alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the Reaction:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring to a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group will remain unchanged.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Transformation: -COOH → -CH3\n        *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. The product is not a carboxylic acid.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
