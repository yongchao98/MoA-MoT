    "This problem requires a step-by-step approach involving stoichiometry and equilibrium chemistry. Here is the detailed reasoning:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Reaction\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction taking place. Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble base. To dissolve it, we need to add a strong acid (like HCl or HNO₃, here represented as H⁺). The acid neutralizes the hydroxide ions, shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nHowever, to determine the *minimum* amount of acid needed, we must consider the equilibrium condition that governs the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃, which is defined by its solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe question states \"to dissolve\" the Fe(OH)₃, which means we need to create conditions where the solid is fully converted to aqueous ions. This state is reached when the ion product ([Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³) is just equal to the Ksp. If the ion product were any higher, the solid would precipitate.\n\n### 2. Calculations\nLet's proceed with the necessary calculations.\n\n**Step 2a: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated from the atomic masses of Iron (Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol), Oxygen (O ≈ 16.00 g/mol), and Hydrogen (H ≈ 1.008 g/mol).\n    Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions in the final solution**\n*   The total volume of the final solution is given as 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.\n*   When all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, all the iron will be in the form of Fe³⁺ ions.\n    [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n**Step 2c: Determine the pH of the resulting solution**\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] at which the Fe(OH)₃ is just dissolved. We use the Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃, which is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ at 25°C.\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n*   Solving for [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷\n    [OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M\n*   Now, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH (at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14):\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.680 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.18\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\n\n**Step 2d: Calculate the required volume of strong acid**\nThe added H⁺ ions from the strong acid do two things:\n1.  React stoichiometrically with the hydroxide from Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Establish the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Moles of free H⁺ to set the pH:\n    First, find the final [H⁺] from the pH: [H⁺] = 10^(-pH) = 10⁻¹⁸² = 0.0151 M.\n    Moles of free H⁺ = [H⁺] * Total Volume = (0.0151 M) * (0.1 L) = 1.51 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ required = (moles for reaction) + (moles for final pH)\n    Total H⁺ moles = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (1.51 x 10⁻³) = 4.317 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, meaning its concentration of H⁺ is 0.1 mol/L.\n    Volume of acid = Total H⁺ moles / Acid Concentration\n    Volume of acid = (4.317 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.04317 L.\n*   Converting the volume to cm³:\n    Volume = 0.04317 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.17 cm³.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\nThe calculated pH is approximately 1.82, and the required volume of acid is approximately 43.17 cm³. These values do not perfectly match any of the options, which is common when dealing with exam questions that might use slightly different constants or rounding. Let's compare our results with the given options:\n\nA) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nOur calculated pH of 1.82 is closest to option D's pH of 2.04. The difference may arise from using a different Ksp value. For example, some sources cite Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ as high as 4x10⁻³⁸, which would yield a pH of 1.94, even closer to 2.04. Let's re-calculate the acid volume using the pH from option D to see if it matches.\n\nIf we assume pH = 2.04 is correct:\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n*   Moles of free H⁺ = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Total H⁺ moles = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Volume of acid = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) is still not very close to 28.05 cm³. There seems to be a discrepancy in the question's provided options or the underlying assumptions. However, based on our rigorous calculation, the pH should be below 2. The closest pH value among the choices is 2.04. Often in such multiple-choice questions, one must select the 'best' fit even if it's not a perfect match.\n\nIf we ignore the amount of acid required to lower the pH (a common simplification in introductory problems, though incorrect):\n*   Moles of H⁺ ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Volume of acid = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option D's volume (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly. This suggests the question author may have made this simplifying assumption (incorrectly ignoring the H⁺ needed for the final pH) when creating the problem. Given that both the calculated pH and this simplified volume point towards option D, it is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
