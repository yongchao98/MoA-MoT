    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` gives the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Decay Process and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The spectroscopic notation is given: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n    *   We assume particle X has spin 0, as is common in such problems (e.g., a pion).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   The conservation law is `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   For this vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of the orbital motion of X.\n    *   `P_f_total = P(NN_f) * P_X * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n    *   So, the conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Pauli Principle for the Final State\n\n*   The problem states a requirement from Pauli statistics: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to requiring `L+S+T` to be odd.\n*   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This means the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 4. Summary of Conditions to Check\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, all three of the following conditions must be met for the final state `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle `X` (with `l_X`):\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = l_X`\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle (for T=0):** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's build a table to check each option against these three rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State             | Particle X | Rule 1: `J_f=l_X`? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` odd? | Rule 3: `S_f+L_f` odd? | Permitted? |\n| :---   | :-----------------------   | :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------- |\n| **A**  | `3D3` (S=1, L=2, J=3)      | `f` (l=3)     | `3=3` Yes        | `2+3=5` Yes           | `1+2=3` Yes            | Yes         |\n| **B**  | `7D1` (S=3, L=2, J=1)      | `p` (l=1)     | `1=1` Yes        | `2+1=3` Yes           | `3+2=5` Yes            | Yes*        |\n| **C**  | `3S1` (S=1, L=0, J=1)      | `p` (l=1)     | `1=1` Yes        | `0+1=1` Yes           | `1+0=1` Yes            | Yes         |\n| **D**  | `3P0` (S=1, L=1, J=0)      | `s` (l=0)     | `0=0` Yes        | `1+0=1` Yes           | `1+1=2` **No**           | **No**      |\n\n*\\*Note on option B:* The final state `7D1` implies a total spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, the maximum total spin they can have is S=1. Therefore, the state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, making the transition forbidden for this fundamental reason. However, the question specifically asks to use the given conservation laws and Pauli statistics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the rules given in the problem statement:\n*   Options A and C satisfy all three conditions.\n*   Option B satisfies all three listed conservation and symmetry rules, but describes a transition to an unphysical state (`S=3`).\n*   Option D satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity but **fails the Pauli principle condition** (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd).\n\nThe question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave using the stated rules. Option D presents a clear violation of one of these explicit rules (`Pauli statistics require...T(NN)=0`). The state `3P0` itself is physically possible for two nucleons, but it must have isospin `T=1`, which contradicts the condition `T_f=0`. Therefore, this reaction pathway is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>"
