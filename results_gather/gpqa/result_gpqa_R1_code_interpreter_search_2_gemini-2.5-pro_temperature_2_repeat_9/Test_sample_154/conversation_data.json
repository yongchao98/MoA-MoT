    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of a quantum mechanical operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the formula:\n    $$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\n    In our case, we need to find:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} $$\n    This requires calculating the expectation value of $P_z$ ($\\langle P_z \\rangle$) and the expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The corresponding row vector (bra) is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $$ \\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    *   The information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ serves as context. The problem explicitly states that the system is in the given state $|\\psi\\rangle$. We can verify that this state is indeed an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$, but this is not necessary for finding $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z$ ($\\langle P_z \\rangle$):**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    First, let's calculate the action of $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $$ P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    $$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z^2$ ($\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$):**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    Now we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    First, let's find $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $$ P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    $$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n    $$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nTo confirm the result, we can use a Python script for the computation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let hbar be a symbolic value for clarity in output.
