As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes**\nThis tells us about the individual contribution of each gene to anthracnose resistance.\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but its loss is not catastrophic. There's a 25% loss in resistance.\n*   **g2 (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. Its loss completely eliminates the plant's defense.\n*   **g3 (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. This means G3 is also important for resistance, apparently more so than G1. There's a 50% loss in resistance.\n\nFrom this, G2 appears to be the most critical gene in the pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutant Phenotypes (Epistasis Analysis)**\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. We compare the double mutant's phenotype to the single mutants' phenotypes.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare to single mutants: `phenotype(g1)`=75%, `phenotype(g2)`=0%.\n    *   The double mutant's phenotype (`0%`) is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. This means the `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This often implies G2 acts downstream of G1, or G2 is an essential component of a parallel pathway, or G2 is an upstream master regulator.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   Compare to single mutants: `phenotype(g2)`=0%, `phenotype(g3)`=50%.\n    *   The double mutant's phenotype (`0%`) is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. This means the `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g3` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n*   **Combining these results:** G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its mutant has the most severe phenotype. The premise states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. The most plausible model is that **G2 is this master transcription factor**, which activates G1, G3, and potentially other genes required for resistance. When G2 is knocked out, the entire pathway downstream is shut down, leading to 0% resistance.\n\n**3. Analyze the g1g3 Double Mutant (Synergy and Redundancy)**\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Compare to single mutants: `phenotype(g1)`=75%, `phenotype(g3)`=50%.\n    *   The double mutant's phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant. Let's see if the effects are additive. Loss from g1 is 25%, loss from g3 is 50%. Additive loss would be 75%, leading to 25% resistance. The observed resistance (10%) is much lower.\n    *   This much stronger effect in the double mutant is called a **synergistic interaction** (or synthetic enhancement). It strongly suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. They are partially redundant; when one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the system fails almost completely. This indicates **gene redundancy**.\n    *   Classical epistasis is not observed between G1 and G3, because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%) or the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits; we only have data on one trait.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: False. The g1g3 phenotype is not the same as the g1 phenotype.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: True. This is indicated by their synergistic interaction.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: False. This is the one incorrect part of the statement based on a strict definition. However, the first two parts represent the most significant conclusions from the experiment.\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely. G2 has the key characteristics of the master regulator.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: True. The data clearly shows this.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Cannot be determined from this experiment.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: False. The g1g3 phenotype is not the same as the g3 phenotype.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B provides the most accurate and comprehensive model for the genetic interactions, even though it contains one terminological error (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"). It correctly identifies the most likely role for G2 (transcription factor) and the correct relationship between G1 and G3 (gene redundancy). The other options contain more significant errors, such as misidentifying the transcription factor (C) or making unsubstantiated claims (A, C, D). Therefore, B is the best conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<B>>>"
