    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The given potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x_i^2$ for $i=x,y,z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers for each dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. So the energy levels are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   **Ground State (lowest energy):** This corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$, which is $n=0$ ($n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). Energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$. Energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    We can list the combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: $(3,0,0)$. This set has 3 permutations: $(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3)$.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: $(2,1,0)$. This set has $3! = 6$ permutations: $(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2)$.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: $(1,1,1)$. This has only 1 permutation.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the general formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level of a D-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    Degeneracy $g_n = \\binom{n+D-1}{n} = \\binom{n+D-1}{D-1}$\n    For our case, $D=3$, so the degeneracy is:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+3-1}{n} = \\binom{n+2}{n} = \\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n    *   A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect\n    *   B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - **Correct**\n    *   C) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect\n    *   D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Incorrect\n\nThe energy formula in options A and C corresponds to a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator. The degeneracy in option D is for the first excited state ($n=1$), not the third.\n\n<<<B>>>"
