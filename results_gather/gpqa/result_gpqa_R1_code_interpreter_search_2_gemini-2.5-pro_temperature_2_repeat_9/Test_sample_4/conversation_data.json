    "The user wants to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ in a specific direction $\\vec{n}$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n### 1. Define the Operator Components\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nHere, $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n### 2. Define the Direction Vector\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nSince the vector lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We can choose the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ represents the angle the vector makes with the z-axis.\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### 3. Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we substitute the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 4. Set Up the Eigenvalue Problem\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\nThe problem specifies the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n### 5. Solve for the Eigenvector Components\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector can be written as:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo get a simple form, we can choose a convenient value for $a$. Let's choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\nThen $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThis gives the unnormalized eigenvector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 6. Normalize the Eigenvector\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The squared norm is:\n$|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe eigenvector is already normalized.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### 7. Final Answer\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\nD) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
