    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Identify Key Principles**\n\n*   **Relativistic System:** The problem involves speeds that may be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use relativistic mechanics. The key equations are for total energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$), where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Harmonic Oscillator:** The force is conservative ($F = -kx$), which means there is a potential energy associated with it, given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** In a conservative system, the total energy is constant throughout the motion.\n\n**2. Define the Total Conserved Energy**\n\nFor a relativistic particle moving in a conservative force field, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy. We must be careful here. The total relativistic energy of a free particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, which includes its rest energy ($mc^2$) and its kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$). The conserved quantity for a particle in a potential field is the sum of this total energy and the potential energy:\n\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\nAlternatively, one can consider the conservation of mechanical energy (kinetic + potential), which is also valid since the rest mass energy $mc^2$ is constant.\nLet's use the mechanical energy form: $E_{mech} = K + U(x) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. This quantity is conserved.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of Energy at Key Points of Motion**\n\nWe will evaluate the total mechanical energy at two specific points in the oscillator's path and set them equal to each other.\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (Turning Point)**\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$ (the mass momentarily stops before turning back)\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Kinetic Energy: $K_A = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U_A = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   Total mechanical energy at this point: $E_{mech} = K_A + U_A = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position**\n    *   Position: $x = 0$ (the potential energy is zero)\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$ (the speed is maximum here)\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Kinetic Energy: $K_0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U_0 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    *   Total mechanical energy at this point: $E_{mech} = K_0 + U_0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n**4. Equate the Energies and Solve for $v_{max}$**\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{mech}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{mech}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n\n$\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n$\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we'll perform some algebraic manipulation. Let's start by inverting both sides:\n\n$\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, take the square root and multiply by $c$ to find $v_{max}$:\n\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nThis derived expression exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
