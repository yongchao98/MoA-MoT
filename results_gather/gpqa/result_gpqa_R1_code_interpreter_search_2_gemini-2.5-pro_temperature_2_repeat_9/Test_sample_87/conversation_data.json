    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, leading to a mucosal immune response in the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Location:** The process is observed in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, crucial for initiating adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the key observations:**\n    *   **Fluorescent Peyer's patches:** This confirms the antigen has been taken up and has reached the site of the immune response.\n    *   **Proliferating cell population:** In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen encounter triggers the clonal expansion (proliferation) of antigen-specific lymphocytes. In the context of B cells, this proliferation occurs robustly within structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **High variability in the variable heavy chain gene:** This is the most critical piece of information. The variable region of the heavy chain (and light chain) determines the antibody's specificity for an antigen. \"High variability\" implies that mutations are being actively introduced into this gene *after* the initial antigen recognition.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the observations:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (and can be activated by the adaptive system). It involves a cascade of serum proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cell genes and does not create variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells, typically in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from Cμ to Cγ or Cα), which alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). It does *not* alter the *variable* region, and therefore does not increase the variability responsible for antigen binding affinity.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a hallmark process of the germinal center reaction in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. It introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable region genes (including the heavy chain) of proliferating B cells. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors. Through a process of selection (affinity maturation), B cells with mutations that improve binding to the antigen are favored to survive and differentiate. This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the \"proliferating cell population.\"\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the primary lymphoid organ (the bone marrow) *before* they encounter any antigen. While it creates diversity, it is not the process responsible for the increasing variability seen in a population of B cells that are already activated and proliferating in a secondary lymphoid organ in response to a specific antigen.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scenario describes an ongoing immune response in a germinal center within a Peyer's patch. The observation of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
