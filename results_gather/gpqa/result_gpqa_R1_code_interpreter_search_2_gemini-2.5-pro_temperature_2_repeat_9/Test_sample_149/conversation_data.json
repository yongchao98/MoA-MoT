    "*   **Step 1: Elucidating the Structure of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n        For C8H9NO, DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The signal is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) with 2 protons (2+1 = 3 peaks). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the **methylene group (-CH2-)** adjacent to the aldehyde. The signal is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single proton (1+1 = 2 peaks), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) in this region, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a primary **amine group (-NH2)**.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Fragments:**\n        We have three fragments:\n        *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n        *   An amine group (-NH2)\n        *   An ethanal group (-CH2-CHO)\n        Putting these together on a para-disubstituted benzene ring gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n\n        Structure of starting material:\n        ```\n             H2N - (C6H4) - CH2-CHO\n        ```\n\n*   **Step 2: Following the Reaction Sequence**\n\n    The starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n    1.  **Reaction with NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n        ```\n             [+N≡N]Cl- - (C6H4) - CH2-CHO\n        ```\n\n    2.  **Reaction with H2O:** Adding water (usually with warming) to an aryl diazonium salt causes the substitution of the diazonium group with a **hydroxyl group (-OH)**. This is a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n        The product is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        ```\n             HO - (C6H4) - CH2-CHO\n        ```\n\n    3.  **Reaction with aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting the product from step 2, an aldehyde with alpha-protons, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of conditions is for an **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** First, the base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product.\n            The aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n\n            Aldol Addition Product (Structure B):\n            ```\n                  OH    CHO\n                  |     |\n            HO-(C6H4)-CH2-CH--CH-(C6H4)-OH\n            ```\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"**Heat**\" is crucial. Aldol addition products often dehydrate (lose a molecule of water) upon heating, especially when the resulting double bond is conjugated with a carbonyl group and/or an aromatic ring. The base facilitates the removal of the acidic alpha-proton (on C2), and the -OH group on C3 is eliminated. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n            Final Condensation Product (Structure A):\n            ```\n                     CHO\n                     |\n            HO-(C6H4)-CH2-CH=C-(C6H4)-OH\n            ```\n            Wait, let me redraw the structure carefully based on the mechanism.\n            Enolate of `HO-Ph-CH2-CHO` attacks another molecule.\n            `[HO-Ph-CH-CHO]^-` attacks `O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH`.\n            The product after dehydration is:\n            ```\n                     CHO\n                     |\n            HO-(C6H4)-C=CH-CH2-(C6H4)-OH\n            ```\n            The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The double bond is between C2 and C3, creating a conjugated system (enal).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\n    Comparing our derived final product with the given options:\n    *   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This matches the structure of the product after both aldol addition and dehydration (condensation).\n    *   **B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the aldol addition product, before dehydration. Given the \"Heat\" condition, the reaction is unlikely to stop at this stage.\n    *   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it's missing the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n    *   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This structure is incorrect and doesn't correspond to a self-condensation product.\n\n    Because the reaction is heated, the thermodynamically stable condensation product is formed. Therefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
