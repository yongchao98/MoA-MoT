    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method, also known as the Doppler wobble method. This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of the host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The magnitude of the Doppler shift, i.e., the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$), is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light. The problem gives the maximum periodic wavelength shift, which corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:** We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of these shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n4.  **Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relationship based on Given Information:** The problem provides the following crucial information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: we assume $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n    *   Since the inclination angle $i$ is unknown for both systems (a common situation in RV detections), and the problem expects a single numerical answer, we must assume the inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Given these conditions, the entire term $\\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$ is a constant for both systems. Also, $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a universal constant.\n    This simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$.\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can now use the proportionality to relate the ratio of amplitudes to the ratio of periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To solve for this, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the value of the amplitude ratio we found in step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3}$\n\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nratio_K = 7.0 / 5.0\n# The relationship is K is proportional to T^(-1/3)\n# So, (K2/K1) = (T2/T1)^(-1/3)\n# (T2/T1) = (K2/K1)^(-3)\nratio_T = ratio_K**(-3)\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n\n<execute_on_code_interpreter>\n['0.3644314792122538\\n']\n</execute_on_code_interpreter>\n\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.3644. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**: The problem describes the detection of exoplanets using the RV method. This method works by detecting the tiny \"wobble\" of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light. When the star moves towards Earth, its light is blueshifted (wavelength decreases), and when it moves away, its light is redshifted (wavelength increases).\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K_star)**: The maximum observed periodic shift in wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K_{star}}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    Since $\\lambda_0$ and $c$ are constants for the same spectral line, we have the direct proportionality:\n    $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes**:\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n4.  **The Formula for Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude is given by Kepler's Third Law and conservation of momentum:\n    $K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane). For the maximum RV signal, $i=90^\\circ$ ($\\sin i = 1$).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Relationship**: The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same masses: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n    *   Since the inclination angle $i$ is not specified, and a single definite answer is expected, we must assume that the statistical viewing angle is the same for both systems (i.e., $i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Under these assumptions, the term $\\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$ is the same for both systems. Also, $(2\\pi G)$ is a constant. This simplifies the formula to a proportionality:\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Finding the Ratio of Orbital Periods**: We can now set up a ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We need to find $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To isolate this term, we raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the value of the velocity amplitude ratio from step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
