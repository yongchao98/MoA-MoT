    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying the reactive intermediate.**\n\nThe first reaction involves combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a dienophile with two double bonds) with a complex reagent, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, in the presence of sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. This setup is characteristic of the *in situ* generation of a highly reactive species which is then trapped by a cycloaddition reaction.\n\nThe name \"5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\" is unusual for a standard reagent. However, the overall reaction context strongly suggests the generation of a simple but very reactive diene. A prime candidate for such a species, especially in a puzzle-like problem, is **cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄)**. Although the provided precursor is not a standard source, we will proceed under the well-founded assumption that its role is to generate cyclobutadiene *in situ*.\n\nThe use of \"2 equivalents\" of the cyclobutadiene precursor corresponds to the two double bonds present in the 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene molecule, suggesting a double Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Reaction for Step 1:**\n7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 cyclobutadiene → Product 1\nProduct 1 is a symmetric \"bis-adduct,\" a complex cage-like molecule where a cyclobutadiene molecule has added across each of the two double bonds of the starting norbornadiene derivative. This adduct serves as a stable \"carrier\" for cyclobutadiene.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether.**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O). These acidic conditions cleave the tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nProduct 1 (-O-tBu) → Product 2 (-OH)\nThe cage structure remains intact. Product 2 is a secondary alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the alcohol.**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild reaction that oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones.\n\nProduct 2 (>CH-OH) → Product 3 (>C=O)\nThe secondary alcohol at position 7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group. Product 3 is a ketone, with the C=O group on the one-carbon bridge of the original norbornane skeleton. The overall cage structure is still maintained.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal decomposition and formation of the final product.**\n\nProduct 3, a complex ketone, is heated to 150 °C. Ketones with the structure of Product 3 (containing adducts of norbornadien-7-one) are known to undergo thermal retro-Diels-Alder reactions.\nThis reaction will release the molecules that were originally added.\n\nProduct 3 → `[norbornadien-7-one]` + 2 cyclobutadiene\n\nThe `[norbornadien-7-one]` intermediate is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude carbon monoxide (CO), forming a stable aromatic product, benzene.\n\n`[norbornadien-7-one]` → benzene + CO\n\nThe other product, cyclobutadiene, is also highly reactive and will quickly dimerize, especially when heated.\n\n2 cyclobutadiene → cyclobutadiene dimer\n\nThe final stable organic product, Product 4, is the dimer of cyclobutadiene. Dimerization can lead to two main isomers: the *syn*-dimer and the *anti*-dimer. At elevated temperatures, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable *anti*-dimer is favored.\n\nProduct 4 = *anti*-tricyclo[4.2.0.0<sup>2,5</sup>]octa-3,7-diene\n\n**Step 5: Determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4.**\n\nThe *anti*-dimer of cyclobutadiene has a center of inversion and belongs to the C<sub>i</sub> point group. The molecule has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn a molecule with C<sub>i</sub> symmetry, each atom (and its attached hydrogen) that does not lie on the center of inversion is mapped onto an equivalent atom. This means the 8 hydrogen atoms are grouped into pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\nThe molecule consists of a central cyclobutane ring fused in a *trans* fashion to two cyclobutene rings. Let's analyze the protons:\n*   There are 4 bridgehead protons on the central ring. They are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons due to the inversion symmetry.\n*   There are 4 vinylic protons on the cyclobutene rings. They are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nLet's verify this using a systematic approach. A molecule with C<sub>i</sub> symmetry will have N/2 NMR signals, where N is the total number of atoms of a given type (protons, in this case), assuming none lie on a symmetry element.\nFor Product 4, N=8. Number of signals = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the final product, the *anti*-dimer of cyclobutadiene, has **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
