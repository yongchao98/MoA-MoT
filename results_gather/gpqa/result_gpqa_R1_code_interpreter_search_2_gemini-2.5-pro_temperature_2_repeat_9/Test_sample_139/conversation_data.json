    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This points towards compounds containing elements like Deuterium (D), Tritium (T), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc.\n    *   **Clue 2: Reacts violently with liquid Y.** This suggests a highly reactive pair, like an alkali metal with water, or a strong hydride with a protic solvent.\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's list potential gas molecules and check this property (using common isotopes, unless otherwise specified).\n        *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   HD (¹H²H): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n        *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   CO (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ND₃ (¹⁴N²H₃): 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   CD₄ (¹²C²H₄): 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.** This implies G is a hydrated (or in this case, likely deuterated) compound that decomposes upon heating to release the solvent.\n    *   **Clue 5: The melting point of B is ~277 K.** 277 Kelvin is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C, which is very close to 4°C. This is a very strong hint: **B is D₂O (heavy water).**\n    *   **Clue 6: X reacts with a keto acid to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction product with only 2 oxygens means a reduction has occurred. Specifically, a reduction that removes an oxygen atom, like the reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Clue 7: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This connects to the reduction reaction. Common reducing agents containing hydrogen are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   From Clue 5, we deduce **B = D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is released from heating G, it implies the whole system contains deuterium, fitting with Clue 1.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is the solvent involved, it's highly likely that the initial liquid, **Y, is also D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction of X with Y (D₂O) produces a gas W. Since the reactants contain D, the gas is likely deuterated. From our list in Clue 3, **D₂** is a prime candidate for W. A reaction between a metal hydride/deuteride and water/heavy water produces hydrogen/deuterium gas.\n    *   The organic chemistry clues (6 and 7) point towards X being a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The deuterated version of LiAlH₄ is **LiAlD₄** (Lithium aluminum deuteride).\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n        *   **Analog:** The close analog is LiAlH₄, a common reagent. (Fits Clue 7).\n        *   **Isotope:** Contains deuterium. (Fits Clue 1).\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂ (W).\n        *   **Violence:** This reaction is violent. (Fits Clue 2).\n        *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits Clue 3).\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ is a solid precipitate. (Fits Clue 4).\n        *   **Substance B from G:** Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) yields Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). (Fits Clue 4).\n        *   **Melting point of B:** B is D₂O, melting point ~277 K. (Fits Clue 5).\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that can reduce a keto acid's two functional groups (ketone and carboxylic acid) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. (Fits Clue 6).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. The elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D = ²H, so its mass is 2. The most stable and common isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, so its mass is 27.\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element (D): Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Al): Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of all D) + (Mass of all Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option D. To be certain, let's run a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Substance X has been identified as LiAlD₄.\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number.\n# H (D): Z=1 (Lightest)\n# Li: Z=3\n# Al: Z=13 (Heaviest)\n\n# Mass numbers for the specific isotopes in the formula.\n# D is the isotope ²H, so its mass number is 2.\n# Al is the stable isotope ²⁷Al, so its mass number is 27.\n\n# Count the number of atoms for the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula LiAlD₄.\nnum_atoms_lightest_element = 4  # There are 4 Deuterium atoms.\nnum_atoms_heaviest_element = 1  # There is 1 Aluminum atom.\n\n# Mass of one atom of the lightest element's isotope.\nmass_lightest_isotope = 2\n# Mass of one atom of the heaviest element's isotope.\nmass_heaviest_isotope = 27\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as defined in the problem.\n# \"summed\" mass = (total mass of lightest element's atoms) + (total mass of heaviest element's atoms)\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_atoms_lightest_element * mass_lightest_isotope\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_atoms_heaviest_element * mass_heaviest_isotope\n\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemical riddle. I will break down the clues and deduce the identity of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance B and its melting point:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water).**\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B from G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n    *   This indicates G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that has D₂O molecules in its structure, which are released upon heating.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction of X with Y:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms.\"\n    *   Since the products involve deuterium (D), it is highly likely that Y, the liquid reactant, is also D₂O. So, **Y is D₂O.**\n    *   The violent reaction of X with D₂O releases a gas W and forms a precipitate G. This is characteristic of strong reducing agents or highly reactive metals.\n\n4.  **Analyze Substance X and its use in organic chemistry:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" and \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a structure like R-CO-COOH, which contains three oxygen atoms (one in the ketone, two in the carboxylic acid).\n    *   A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 implies the reduction of one of the functional groups. Powerful reducing agents can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols. For example, R-CO-COOH could be reduced to R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This product is a diol and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). LiAlH₄ is strong enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. NaBH₄ typically only reduces ketones and aldehydes.\n    *   The \"close analog\" would be LiAlH₄. The problem states X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The most logical candidate for X is the deuterated version of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n\n5.  **Verify the entire reaction sequence with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (part of G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   **Violent reaction:** This is correct. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water/heavy water.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂ (deuterium gas). Let's check the neutron/proton count. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue: \"gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble in D₂O, and Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is an insoluble solid precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** When you heat a metal hydroxide/deuteroxide like Al(OD)₃, it decomposes into the metal oxide and water/heavy water. The reaction is 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). This confirms that heating G releases B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and the isotope Deuterium (D, of hydrogen, atomic number 1).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved: D has a mass number of 2, and the common stable isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all Deuterium atoms in one formula unit = 4 atoms * 2 u/atom = 8 u.\n    *   Mass of the Aluminum atom in one formula unit = 1 atom * 27 u/atom = 27 u.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Mass of all D atoms) + (Mass of the Al atom) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe python code generated in the thought process confirms this calculation.\n```python\n# Identify Substance X: Based on the chemical clues, Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n# Elements in Substance X: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Deuterium (D).\n# Identify lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number:\n# Lightest: Hydrogen (isotope is Deuterium, D).
