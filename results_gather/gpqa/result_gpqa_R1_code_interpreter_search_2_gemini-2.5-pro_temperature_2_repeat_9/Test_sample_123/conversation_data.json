    "This problem deals with the relativistic decay of particles and the concept of time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the physics and the calculation:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of unstable particles, *N*, that remain after a time, *t*, from an initial population, *$N_0$*, is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    $N = N_0 * e^(-t/\\tau')$\n    where $\\tau'$ is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame of reference where the time *t* is measured (in this case, the laboratory frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma * \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity *v* is extremely close to the speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the time *t* it takes for them to travel the detector radius, *R*, can be approximated as:\n    $t \\approx R/c$\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** We can substitute the expressions for *t* and $\\tau'$ into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles that survive, $N/N_0$:\n    $N/N_0 = e^ (-(R/c) / (\\gamma * \\tau_0))$\n\n5.  **Setting up a Proportionality:** The detector radius *R*, the speed of light *c*, and the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ are all constants in this problem. We can rearrange the equation to isolate the variables:\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: $ln(N/N_0) = - (R / (c\\tau_0)) * (1/\\gamma)$\n    *   Multiply by $-\\gamma$: $-\\gamma * ln(N/N_0) = R / (c\\tau_0)$\n    *   Since the right side is a constant, the term on the left, $-\\gamma * ln(N/N_0)$, must also be constant across different scenarios. Note that $-ln(N/N_0)$ is the same as $ln(N_0/N)$. So we have:\n        $\\gamma * ln(N_0/N) = Constant$\n\n6.  **Applying to the Scenarios:** We can now set the expressions for the two scenarios equal to each other:\n    $\\gamma_1 * ln(N_{0,1}/N_1) = \\gamma_2 * ln(N_{0,2}/N_2)$\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** $\\gamma_1 = 20$. One-third of particles reach the wall, so the survival fraction $N_1/N_{0,1} = 1/3$. Therefore, $N_{0,1}/N_1 = 3$.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall, so $N_2/N_{0,2} = 2/3$. Therefore, $N_{0,2}/N_2 = 3/2$. We need to find $\\gamma_2$.\n\n7.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$):**\n    Plug the values into the equation:\n    $20 * ln(3) = \\gamma_2 * ln(3/2)$\n\n    Now, we can solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))$\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to solve for gamma_2 = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\ngamma_2 = 20 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculated value of $\\gamma_2$ is approximately 54.19. This is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
