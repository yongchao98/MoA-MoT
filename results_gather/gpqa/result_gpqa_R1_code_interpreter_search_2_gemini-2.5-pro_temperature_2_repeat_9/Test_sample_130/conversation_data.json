    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Part 1: Identify the reactants.**\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   Anhydride NMR data: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The second reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   **Part 2: Understand the reaction.**\n        *   The anhydride reacts with the cyclopentadiene derivative.\n        *   This is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n        *   It yields a major and a minor product. This points to stereoisomers, specifically *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n        *   The molecular formula of the products is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   **Part 3: Analyze the spectroscopy of the products.**\n        *   A 2D NOESY experiment was performed on both products.\n        *   A specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n        *   The question asks to identify the two proton signals connected by this specific cross-peak in the major product.\n\n2.  **Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n    *   **Step 2.1: Identifying the Anhydride.**\n        *   The starting material is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The simplest example is maleic acid.\n        *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n        *   Let's check if maleic anhydride matches the given NMR data.\n            *   Structure of maleic anhydride (furan-2,5-dione): It's a planar five-membered ring containing `HC=CH`, two `C=O` groups, and an ether oxygen linking the carbonyls (`-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-`).\n            *   Symmetry: The molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons (H-C=C-H) chemically equivalent. It also makes the two vinylic carbons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n            *   Predicted ¹H NMR: One signal for the two equivalent vinylic protons. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic for vinylic protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. This matches the data \"single peak (7 ppm)\".\n            *   Predicted ¹³C NMR: Two signals. One for the equivalent vinylic carbons (~137 ppm) and one for the equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm). This matches the data \"two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm)\".\n        *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Step 2.2: Identifying the Diene and Verifying Stoichiometry.**\n        *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n        *   Structure: A five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3. Methyl groups are on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n        *   Molecular Formula: Cyclopentadiene is C₅H₆. Replacing four H atoms with four methyl (CH₃) groups gives C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₉H₁₄.\n        *   The reaction is an addition: C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) + C₉H₁₄ (diene) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given for the products.\n\n    *   **Step 2.3: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Stereochemistry.**\n        *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n        *   The Alder-endo rule predicts that the *endo* product will be the major product due to secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *exo* product will be the minor product.\n        *   Let's analyze the geometry of the *endo* and *exo* products. The key for NOESY is the spatial proximity of protons.\n        *   **Endo product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond of the final product and *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7, the original CH₂ group). Consequently, the two protons on the anhydride-bearing carbons (let's call them `H(fused)`) are in an *exo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge. This makes `H(fused)` close in space to the protons on the C7 bridge (`H(bridge)`).\n        *   **Exo product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *exo*, meaning *syn* to the C7 bridge. The `H(fused)` protons are therefore in an *endo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge and towards the C=C double bond. This makes `H(fused)` close in space to the vinylic methyl groups (`Me(vinylic)`) attached to the C=C bond.\n\n    *   **Step 2.4: Interpreting the NOESY Data.**\n        *   NOESY cross-peaks indicate protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n        *   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent... in the spectrum of the minor product.\"\n        *   This means we are looking for an interaction that is unique to the **endo** (major) isomer.\n        *   Based on our geometric analysis:\n            *   Interaction in major (*endo*) product: `H(fused) ↔ H(bridge)`\n            *   Interaction in minor (*exo*) product: `H(fused) ↔ Me(vinylic)`\n        *   Therefore, the observed cross-peak in the major product must connect the signals of `H(fused)` and `H(bridge)`.\n\n    *   **Step 2.5: Assigning NMR Signals and Choosing the Correct Option.**\n        *   We need to assign the signals given in the options to the protons in the product.\n            *   **`Me(vinylic)`:** 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C bond. Deshielded. **~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   **`Me(bridgehead)`:** 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead sp³ carbons. More shielded. **~1.0 ppm**.\n            *   **`H(fused)`:** 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the carbons from the original dienophile. These are α to carbonyls. Very deshielded. **~3.5 ppm**.\n            *   **`H(bridge)`:** Protons on the C7 CH₂ bridge. These are on a strained aliphatic ring. **~1.5 ppm**. The question simplifies this signal to a \"1H doublet\". This likely refers to one of the two diastereotopic bridge protons.\n        *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between `H(fused)` and `H(bridge)`.\n        *   Let's find the option that connects these two signals:\n            *   Signal for `H(fused)`: a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n            *   Signal for `H(bridge)`: a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n        *   This combination matches option D.\n\n    *   **Final Check:**\n        *   Option A: Me(bridgehead) and H(bridge). Distance should be similar in both isomers. Not a unique peak.\n        *   Option B: Me(bridgehead) and Me(vinylic). Distance should be similar in both isomers. Not a unique peak.\n        *   Option C: Me(vinylic) and H(fused). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n        *   Option D: H(bridge) and H(fused). This interaction is characteristic of the *major* (*endo*) product. This is consistent with all information provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
