    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction to determine the reactants and major final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n**Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton available. Dimethyl malonate has acidic α-protons on the CH₂ group, located between two electron-withdrawing ester groups. The base NaOEt will remove one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion:\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This enolate is the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, making it electrophilic.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate in a 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition).\n    *   `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`\n    *   This forms a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n    *   `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃` + `EtOH` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + `EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Identify the Product (A):** The final product is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the names given in the options. The naming can be confusing, so let's check which name corresponds to this structure.\n    *   **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate:** This name is derived from propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid (`HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH(COOH)₂`). A 2-(p-tolyl) substitution would give `HOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOH)₂`. The trimethyl ester is `MeOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOMe)₂`. This is an isomer of our product, not the product itself. The bond formation is different.\n    *   **trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate:** This name is derived from propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylic acid (`(HOOC)₂CH-CH(COOH)-CH₃`). A 3-(p-tolyl) substitution would give `p-Tolyl-CH₂-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)₂`. This is also not the product of the Michael addition.\n\n    There seems to be an inconsistency in the IUPAC naming within the options for product A. The true IUPAC name for the product `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` is **trimethyl 4-(p-tolyl)butane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. However, we must choose from the given options. We will rely on the analysis of the other reactions to select the correct choice.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺ (Methanol, followed by acidic workup)\n**Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (a Michael addition variant)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine's β-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized anion, which is then protonated (by MeOH).\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the resulting iminium salt back to a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product (B):** The reaction results in a new C-C bond between the C2 of the original cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring becomes a cyclohexanone ring (`C=O` at C1).\n    *   The substituent at C2 is from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n    *   Naming this compound with butanenitrile as the parent chain gives **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` is the enol form, which is not the major product after a standard acidic hydrolysis workup. Therefore, the keto form is the correct major product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n**Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Reaction Type:** Retro-Michael analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Michael Acceptor:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The structure has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group at the C2 position. The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Disconnect the Product:** A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Acceptor: `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`\n    *   Product's side chain: `-(C)H₂-(C)H₂-CO-CH₃`. The first CH₂ is the original β-carbon of MVK. The second CH₂ is the original α-carbon.\n    *   The new bond is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon (`CH₂`) of MVK.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reactant (C):** To form this product, the nucleophile (Michael donor) must be the enolate of reactant C. The structure that remains after removing the MVK fragment is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The C2 position of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is highly acidic due to the two flanking carbonyls. The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a potent nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK to form the given product.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. Its enol form (`3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one`) is in equilibrium, but the compound itself is named as the dione. The names `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` in options C and D are structurally incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **Product A:** The name is problematic in all options, but the reaction itself is a standard Michael addition.\n*   **Product B:** `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. This eliminates options B and C.\n*   **Reactant C:** `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This eliminates options C and D (which also use an incorrect name for the enol form).\n\nBy combining the conclusions for B and C, we can definitively select the correct answer. Both B and C are correctly identified in option A. Although the name for product A in the option is not strictly correct IUPAC nomenclature for the Michael adduct, the other components of the option are correct.\n\n**A**: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (name is likely an error for the true product), B = `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile` (Correct), C = `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` (Correct)\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice that correctly identifies product B and reactant C.\n\n<<<A>>>"
