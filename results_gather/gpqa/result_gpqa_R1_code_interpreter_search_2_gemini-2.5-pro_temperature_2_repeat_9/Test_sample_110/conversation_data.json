    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the alpha-carbon of the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile (Michael donor) and attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has no α-hydrogens, so it cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. This hydrogen is the only available α-hydrogen for deprotonation.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate anion attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   After protonation (workup), the product is formed. The side chain added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial ketone skeleton is a cyclohexanone ring with C1=O, a C(Et)(Me) group at C2, and a C(Me) group at C6.\n    *   The reaction adds a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group to C6.\n    *   The resulting product structure is: a cyclohexanone ring with C1=O, C2 bearing an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 bearing a methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`).\n    *   Let's name this product according to IUPAC rules to match the options. The side chain is named as `ethyl 3-(...-yl)propanoate`. We need to name the cyclohexyl part as a substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules for naming substituents, the point of attachment to the parent chain is numbered as C1. So, our C6 (the point of attachment) becomes the new C1'.\n    *   Let's renumber the ring for naming purposes:\n        *   C1' (formerly C6) has a methyl group and is the attachment point.\n        *   C2' (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting the substituent names together in alphabetical order, the name of the ring substituent is `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexan-1-yl`. The attachment point is usually implied as position 1 if not stated otherwise.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the structure given in options B and C.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group (-NO₂). KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent Michael donor. (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):**\n    *   1-nitropropane is CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂.\n    *   The α-carbon (C1, the one bonded to the -NO₂ group) has two acidic hydrogens.\n    *   KOH removes one of these protons to form the nucleophilic carbanion: CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane moiety and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile moiety.\n    *   The intermediate anion is protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup step.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The fragment from 1-nitropropane is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these gives the product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the -CN group is C1.\n    *   Numbering the chain:\n        CN(C1) - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Naming alphabetically, the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options C and D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options A and D.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nBoth conditions are met only in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
