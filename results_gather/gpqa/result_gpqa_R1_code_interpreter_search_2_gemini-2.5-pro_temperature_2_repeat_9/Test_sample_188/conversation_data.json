    "The user wants to identify which of the listed particles is not a Goldstone boson. Goldstone's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless, spin-0 particle called a Goldstone boson appears in the spectrum. These are excitations of the system along the broken symmetry directions. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Pion:** Pions (specifically, the charged pions π⁺, π⁻ and the neutral pion π⁰) are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate axial chiral symmetry SU(2)ₗ × SU(2)ᵣ down to the vector subgroup SU(2)ᵥ (isospin symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are not exactly massless because the chiral symmetry is also explicitly broken by the small masses of the up and down quarks, but they are understood within this framework. So, the pion is associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n2.  **Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the ground state has all spins aligned in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the global spin-rotation symmetry (SO(3) or SU(2)). The low-energy excitations of this system are spin waves, and their quanta are called magnons. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken because the atoms form a periodic lattice. The atoms are located at specific sites, and the ground state is no longer invariant under an arbitrary translation (only under discrete translations by a lattice vector). The Goldstone bosons associated with this broken continuous translational symmetry are the long-wavelength acoustic phonons.\n\n4.  **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a type of topological soliton. It is a stable, non-linear, particle-like solution in a field theory. It was originally proposed in the context of nuclear physics, where nucleons (protons and neutrons) can be modeled as Skyrmions of the pion field. While the theory describing pions involves spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. It is a non-perturbative, localized energy lump, whose existence depends on the topology of the manifold of vacuum states, not a quantum of a collective excitation (like pions, magnons, or phonons are). Therefore, a Skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson and is not the *direct particle manifestation* (the massless mode) of a spontaneously broken symmetry in the way the others are.\n\nConclusion: Pions, magnons, and phonons are all examples of Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. The Skyrmion is a different kind of entity, a topological soliton.\n\n<<<B>>>"
