    "This problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis of the acid-base reactions occurring in the mixture. We have a strong acid (HCl), a weak acid (CH3COOH), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    Moles H+ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    Moles CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two moles of OH- for every one mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    Moles Ba(OH)2 = Concentration × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    Moles OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization of the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2) in a 1:1 ratio.\nH+ + OH- → H2O\n\n*   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ will be consumed.\nMoles of OH- remaining after neutralization = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol OH-\n\n**Step 3: Neutralization of the weak acid by the excess strong base.**\n\nThe remaining 0.100 mol of OH- will now react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\n*   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- (from Step 2) = 0.100 mol\n\nThe weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol OH-\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions from the strong base. The presence of this excess strong base will determine the pH of the solution.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\n\nFirst, we need the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\nNext, calculate the pOH of the solution.\n*   pOH = -log[OH-]\n*   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles of reactants\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400  # Moles of H+ from strong acid\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500 # Moles of weak acid\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\nmoles_oh = 2 * moles_baoh2 # Moles of OH- from strong base\n\n# Step 2: Strong acid-base neutralization\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh - moles_hcl\n\n# Step 3: Strong base-weak acid neutralization\nmoles_oh_excess_final = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: pH calculation\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300  # Total volume in Liters\nconcentration_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess_final / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh_excess)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
