    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. Because the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`, the potential at an observation point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the charge at an earlier time, `t_r`, known as the **retarded time**. This is the time at which the charge emitted the signal that reaches the observer at `r` at time `t`.\n\nThe general solutions for V and A in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere the retarded time is $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|}{c}$.\n\n### 2. Adapting for a Point Charge\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented using the Dirac delta function:\n-   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n-   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals requires careful evaluation due to the retardation in the time argument of the delta function.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Scalar Potential (V)\nSubstituting the charge density into the integral for V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\nThe integral is non-trivial because `t_r` depends on the integration variable `r'`. The standard result of this integration (as found in electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") is:\n$\\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV' = \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, the quantities in the square brackets are all evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`, and:\n-   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.\n-   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the retarded position to the observation point.\n-   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n-   The retarded time `t_r` is determined by the implicit equation: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThus, the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{c}{c(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Deriving the Vector Potential (A)\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, we substitute the current density:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} dV'$\n\nSince `q` and `v(t_r)` are constant with respect to the spatial integration over `dV'`, they can be factored out of the integral evaluation. The integral part is the same as for V:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ q\\vec{v} \\frac{1}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\nOur expressions:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n-   **Option A:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d c + d . v))`, `A(...)`. The plus sign in the denominator is incorrect. It would correspond to an advanced potential (which is non-causal) or a source moving away from the observer creating a stronger potential, which contradicts the Doppler effect.\n-   **Option B:** `V(r,t) = q / (4*pi*epsilon_o * r)`. This is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are important.\n-   **Option C:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4*pi*epsilon_o * (d c - d . v))`, `A(r,t) = (mu_o qc * v) / (4*pi * (d c - d . v))`. This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The minus sign is correct, indicating that the potential is enhanced when the charge moves toward the observer (`d . v > 0`).\n-   **Option D:** `V(r,t) = q / (4*pi*epsilon_o * r)`. Again, the static potential is incorrect. Also, the expression for `A` is dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n\nThus, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
