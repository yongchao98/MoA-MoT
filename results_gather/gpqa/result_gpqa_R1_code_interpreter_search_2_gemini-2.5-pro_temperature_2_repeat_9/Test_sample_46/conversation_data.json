    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation of DoU:** The formula for degrees of unsaturation is: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is highly suggestive of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester group, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. An amide C=O (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹) or a carboxylic acid C=O (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹, but accompanied by a very broad O-H stretch) are less likely.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule implies it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH2- group).\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH2-CH3\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule implies it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 hydrogens (a -CH3 group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This high chemical shift for a methylene group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **Fragment:** An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This signal and the triplet at 1.20 ppm are coupled, confirming the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH2) which are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **Fragment:** A primary amine group (-NH2), which confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This simple A-A'B-B' pattern (appearing as two doublets) is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Fragment:** A para-substituted benzene ring. The two substituents are an electron-donating group (the -NH2) which shields nearby protons (lower ppm, 7.0 ppm) and an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt) which deshields nearby protons (higher ppm, 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and NMR (2H broad singlet) data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide, not an ester. Also, the substitution is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern than two doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure contains a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, matching all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. In this isomer (Ar-O-CO-CH2CH3), the quartet for the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
