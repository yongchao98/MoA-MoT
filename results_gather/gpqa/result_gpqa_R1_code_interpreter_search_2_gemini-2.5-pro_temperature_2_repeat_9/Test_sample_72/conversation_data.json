    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to solve a problem in special relativity involving two astronauts. I need to calculate two quantities: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) at relativistic speeds. To find their relative speed, I must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, which is a form of the Lorentz velocity transformation.\n\nLet the velocity of the first astronaut be $v_1 = 0.6c$ and the velocity of the second astronaut be $v_2 = 0.5c$. Both velocities are measured in the same inertial frame of reference.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$ or $v_{12}$) of object 1 as seen from object 2 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, I will substitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the given options, I will convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\nThis narrows down the possibilities to options B and C.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the total energies of the individual particles. The total energy ($E$) of a single particle of rest mass ($m_0$) moving at speed ($v$) is given by:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each astronaut and then sum them up.\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the total energy $E_{total}$:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo get a numerical value, I'll use the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $5.96 mc^2$.\n\nTo be precise, I can use the python interpreter for the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate relative velocity as a fraction of c\nv_rel_over_c = 0.1 / 0.7\nprint(f\"v_rel/c = {v_rel_over_c:.2f}\")\n\n# Calculate total energy in units of mc^2\nE_total_factor = 2.5 + 2 * math.sqrt(3)\nprint(f\"E_total / (mc^2) = {E_total_factor:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nv_rel/c = 0.14\nE_total / (mc^2) = 5.96\n</execute_code>\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese results match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The total energy ($E$) of a single particle with rest mass ($m_0$) moving at speed ($v$) is given by Einstein's famous equation modified for relativistic speeds:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nI will calculate the energy for each astronaut separately and then add them to find the total energy.\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, I calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNext, I calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, I calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNext, I calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Finally, I calculate the total energy $E_{total}$:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo obtain a numerical value for comparison, I will use the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values correspond exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
