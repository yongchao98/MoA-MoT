    "This problem requires us to calculate the fraction of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, free cobalt ions `Co^2+` react with thiocyanate ions `SCN^-` to form a series of complexes. The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ;  `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**2. The Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe percentage of any single cobalt-containing species is given by its distribution coefficient, α. The distribution coefficient for the n-th complex, `α_n`, is the ratio of the concentration of that complex to the total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]`, `[SCN^-]`, and the stability constants:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]`, denoted as `α2`, is:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Assumption about [SCN-]**\n\nThe concentration of the ligand, `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M`, is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`. Because the ligand is in significant excess, we can assume that the concentration of the free ligand at equilibrium is approximately equal to its initial total concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN^-] = 0.1 M` in our calculation.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nWe can now plug in the given values to calculate `α2`.\n\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nThis calculation is best performed using a script for accuracy.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Numerator for alpha2\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Denominator (Sum term)\n# Let's call the denominator 'S'\nS = 1 + beta1*scn_conc + beta2*(scn_conc**2) + beta3*(scn_conc**3) + beta4*(scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate alpha2 (the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex)\nalpha2 = numerator / S\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>python_execution_output:16.91575742197412\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.92%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the calculation of the percentage of a specific species, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate.\n\n**1. Governing Equilibria and Species**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is distributed among several species due to the stepwise formation of complexes with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN-`). The species present are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ions (`Co(H₂O)₆²⁺`, but we simplify to Co²⁺)\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β_n):\n*   `Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)`\n*   `β_n = [[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n)`\n\n**2. The Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe fraction of the total cobalt that exists as a specific species `[Co(SCN)_n]` is given by its distribution coefficient, `α_n`.\n`α_n = [[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)] / c(Co)`\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the β values:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nWe are interested in the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which corresponds to `α₂`.\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + ... + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, giving a formula for `α₂` that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\n**Assumption**: The concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion `c(Co)` (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in significant excess, the amount that is consumed to form the complexes is relatively small. We can therefore approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN⁻]`, with its initial total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nLet's plug the values into the equation for `α₂`:\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term 0: `1`\n    *   Term 1: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.92%`\n\nThis result matches the provided python code output (`16.916...`) and corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
