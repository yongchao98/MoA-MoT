    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of these energy levels.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_i` in an excited state `i` to the number of atoms `N_j` in another state `j`:\n    `N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `N_i`, `N_j` = number of atoms in states `i` and `j`.\n    *   `g_i`, `g_j` = statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_i`, `E_j` = energies of the states.\n    *   `k` = Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` = temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply to the specific problem:** We are comparing the population of a specific excited level (let's call its energy `E_exc` and statistical weight `g_exc`) to the ground state (with energy `E_0 = 0` and statistical weight `g_0`). The term \"excitation\" typically refers to this ratio. The equation for a single star becomes:\n    `Ratio_exc = N_exc / N_0 = (g_exc / g_0) * exp(-E_exc / (k * T))`\n\n4.  **Interpret the given information:**\n    *   We have two stars, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`.\n    *   \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to... star_2.\" This means the excitation ratio in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n        `Ratio_exc,1 = 2 * Ratio_exc,2`\n    *   The energy of the excited level is `E_exc = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n5.  **Set up the equations for both stars:**\n    For star_1: `Ratio_exc,1 = (g_exc / g_0) * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_1))`\n    For star_2: `Ratio_exc,2 = (g_exc / g_0) * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Combine the equations using the given ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for the ratios into the relation `Ratio_exc,1 = 2 * Ratio_exc,2`:\n    `(g_exc / g_0) * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_exc / g_0) * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_exc / g_0)` is the same for both stars (as it concerns the same energy levels of the same atom, iron) and thus cancels out:\n    `exp(-E_exc / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_2))`\n\n8.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln[exp(-E_exc / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-E_exc / (k * T_2))]`\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`, we get:\n    `-E_exc / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - E_exc / (k * T_2)`\n\n9.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to isolate `ln(2)` as it appears in the options:\n    `ln(2) = E_exc / (k * T_2) - E_exc / (k * T_1)`\n    Factor out the common term `(E_exc / k)`:\n    `ln(2) = (E_exc / k) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1)`\n\n10. **Combine the terms in the parenthesis:** Find a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n    `ln(2) = (E_exc / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Incorporate the numerical values:** The problem provides `E_exc ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`. The problem is set up so that the ratio `(E_exc / k)` is numerically equal to 1.\n    `(E_exc / k) = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    Let's check the units. The term `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)` has units of `1/K`. So, `(E_exc / k) * [...]` has units of `K * (1/K)`, which is dimensionless, matching the dimensionless nature of `ln(2)`. The numerical coincidence strongly implies that the constant factor `E_exc / k` should be treated as 1 in the final expression.\n\n12. **Final Equation:** Substituting `E_exc / k = 1`, we get:\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n13. **Compare with the options:** This result matches option B. Note that since star_1 is \"more excited,\" it must have a higher temperature (`T_1 > T_2`), which makes the right-hand side of the equation positive, consistent with `ln(2)` being positive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
