    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the factors influencing product distribution.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring (`C6H5-X`). The substituent `X` determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming electrophile (in this case, `Br+`) attaches. Substituents are either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\nThe question asks for the yield of the *para*-isomer.\n*   For *meta*-directing substituents, the yield of ortho and para isomers is very low.\n*   For *ortho,para*-directing substituents, the yield of para and ortho isomers is high, and we need to determine the ratio between them.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents for each substance.**\nLet's analyze the substituent (`-X`) for each of the six compounds:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): `-CH3` is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho,para-directing**.\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` is an ester group with a carbonyl (`C=O`) attached to the ring. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho,para-directing**.\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` is a nitro group. It is strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` is an alkyl group. It is **activating** and **ortho,para-directing**.\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` is a carboxylic acid group with a carbonyl (`C=O`) attached to the ring. It is **deactivating** and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 3: Group the substances and order within groups.**\nWe can separate the substances into two groups: those that will produce very little para-isomer (meta-directors) and those that will produce a significant amount of para-isomer (ortho,para-directors).\n\n**Group A: Meta-directors (low para-isomer yield)**\nThese are substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n*   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n*   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nThe para-isomer is an unfavored minor product for these compounds. The amount of para-isomer formed will be inversely related to the strength of the meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n`-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5` (Nitro is the strongest deactivator, ethyl benzoate's group is the weakest of the three).\n\nTherefore, the percentage of para-isomer will increase in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\n% para yield: `-NO2` < `-COOH` < `-COOC2H5`\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Group B: Ortho,para-directors (high para-isomer yield)**\nThese are substances 1, 3, and 5.\n*   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n*   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n*   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nFor these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This ratio is primarily governed by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The `-C2H5` (ethyl) group is sterically larger than the `-CH3` (methyl) group. This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions more significantly in ethylbenzene than in toluene. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered *para* position is more favored for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, % para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) > % para yield of Toluene (1).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** Halogens like `-Cl` are ortho,para-directing due to resonance but are deactivating overall due to a strong inductive effect. This strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect particularly destabilizes the adjacent ortho positions, making the para position highly favored. The bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%). This percentage is higher than for both toluene (typically ~66% para) and ethylbenzene (typically ~71% para).\n    *   Therefore, the order for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the groups.**\nThe substances in Group A (meta-directors) will all have a much lower para-isomer yield than the substances in Group B (ortho,para-directors). We can combine our derived orders:\n\n(Order of Group A) < (Order of Group B)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence, in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
