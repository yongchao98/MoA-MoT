    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment from a fission reaction using two different models: the correct relativistic model and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. We then need to find the difference between these two results.\n\n### 1. Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial_rest = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial total energy: `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV` (since it's at rest).\n    *   Initial momentum: `p_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2` (Let `m1` be the more massive fragment).\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial rest-mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Determining Rest-Masses and Q-value\n\nWe can solve for the individual rest-masses of the fragments:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe **Q-value** of the reaction is the energy released as kinetic energy. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n`Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n`Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy `Q` is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n`p1 = p2 = p`.\n\n### 4. Kinetic Energy Calculation (Classical)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Kinetic Energy Calculation (Relativistic)\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, `E = mc^2 + T`.\nSubstituting `E`:\n`(mc^2 + T)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`\n`m^2c^4 + 2Tmc^2 + T^2 = (pc)^2 + m^2c^4`\n`(pc)^2 = 2Tmc^2 + T^2`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. We can equate the expressions for both fragments:\n`2*T1*m1c^2 + T1^2 = 2*T2*m2c^2 + T2^2`\n\nNow we substitute the known values:\n*   `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`2 * T1 * (198) + T1^2 = 2 * (3 - T1) * (99) + (3 - T1)^2`\n`396*T1 + T1^2 = (594 - 198*T1) + (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2)`\n`396*T1 + T1^2 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n\nCancel the `T1^2` term from both sides:\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600 * T1 = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. The Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic (`T1_rel`) and classical (`T1_cl`) values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n```python\n# Initial mass-energy in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy (Q-value) released\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n# T1 + T2 = Q\n# From conservation of momentum (p1=p2) and T = p^2/(2m), we get T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1 + 2*T1 = Q  => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formula\n# From (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2 and (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2, we solve the equation:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*m2c2\n# This simplifies to a linear equation in T1: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603.0 / 600.0\n\n# Calculate the difference between the two values\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\n<<<\nA",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final State Parameters\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy: `E_i = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `p_i = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n\nWe can solve for the rest-mass energies of the fragments, `m1c^2` and `m2c^2`.\n1.  From the mass relationship, we also have `m1c^2 = 2 * (m2c^2)`.\n2.  Substitute this into the sum equation (multiplied by `c^2`):\n    `m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2)`\n    `2*(m2c^2) + m2c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV`\n    `3 * (m2c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`\n3.  Now, we can find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment `m1`:\n    `m1c^2 = 2 * (m2c^2) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. It's the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_i - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Conservation of Momentum\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be `p`.\n*   `p1 = p2 = p`\n\n### 5. Calculation of T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy (`T`) is related to momentum (`p`) by the formula `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_cl = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_cl = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\n*   This gives us `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n*   `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### 6. Calculation of T1 (Relativistic)\n\nIn relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass (`m`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. The total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, `E = T + mc^2`.\nBy rearranging the formula, we can express the momentum as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2`. Expanding this gives:\n*   `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`. We can set the expressions for the two fragments equal to each other:\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n\nNow substitute the known values (`m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`):\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nSimplify the equation:\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n*   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1_rel`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n*   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cl`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
