    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group** (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group** (-C(CH₃)₃ or -tBu) at position 2.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 3.\n\nThe three substituents are adjacent to each other on the ring (a 1,2,3-substitution pattern).\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, causing significant steric hindrance at its ortho positions.\n*   **-NO₂**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### 2. Retrosynthetic Analysis & Strategy Formulation\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, especially with a bulky group like tert-butyl, is non-trivial. Direct substitution onto tert-butylbenzene would yield mostly the para-product, not the ortho-product needed for this synthesis. This strongly suggests that a **blocking group** strategy is required. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is a common choice for a temporary blocking group because it can be easily introduced (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n\nLet's devise a plausible synthetic pathway:\n\n*   **Final steps:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is commonly synthesized from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., `NaOH/EtBr`). The phenol, in turn, is often made from an amine (-NH₂) via diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H₃O⁺/Heat`). The amine comes from the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. This implies that one of the nitro groups introduced during the synthesis will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n\n*   **Core strategy:** We need to introduce a t-butyl group, a nitro group that will remain, and a second nitro group that will be converted to the ethoxy group. The key is to arrange them in the correct 1,2,3 pattern. The blocking group will help direct the substituents to the desired positions.\n\nA plausible synthetic pathway using a blocking group:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene`\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but it's very bulky. Sulfonation will predominantly occur at the sterically accessible para position.\n    `tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid)\n3.  **First Nitration:** Now we nitrate this intermediate. We have a t-Bu group (o,p-director) and a -SO₃H group (m-director) para to each other. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho to the t-Bu group (C2 and C6).\n    `p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    This introduces the first nitro group, which we will later convert into the ethoxy group. It is correctly positioned ortho to the t-butyl group.\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce this first nitro group to an amine.\n    `... + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n5.  **Second Nitration:** Now, introduce the second nitro group, which will be the final nitro group in the product. The reactant is an aniline derivative. The amino group is a powerful o,p-director and must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation to -NHAc) to prevent oxidation and protonation. The directing groups are now -NHAc (at C2, strong o,p), -tBu (at C4, o,p), and -SO₃H (at C1, meta). The powerful -NHAc group directs to its ortho position (C3) and para position (C5). The other groups also direct to C3 and C5. The key step for the 1,2,3-pattern is for nitration to occur at the C3 position, despite it being sterically hindered between the -NHAc and -tBu groups. Assuming this is the desired outcome for the puzzle:\n    `... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n6.  **Desulfonation (Deblocking):** Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid.\n    `... + dilute H₂SO₄ → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`\n    This gives the key precursor with the correct 1,2,3-arrangement.\n7.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amine to a diazonium salt.\n    `... + NaNO₂/HCl → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride`\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** Convert the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n    `... + H₃O⁺/Heat → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether. (Note: numbering changes as -OEt gets priority 1).\n    `... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow we compare this valid sequence of operations with the provided options. We need a sequence of reagents that matches our derived path. The required key steps are: (1) tBuCl, (2) SO₃, (3) HNO₃, (4) Fe/HCl, (5) another HNO₃, (6) dil. H₂SO₄, and the (7,8,9) amine-to-ether conversion block.\n\n*   **Option A:** `...viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ix) dilute H₂SO₄`. The blocking/deblocking steps are at the very end, after the molecule has already been formed incorrectly. This is illogical.\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃...`. This sequence attempts Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is problematic and would yield the meta-isomer, which does not lead to the target product.\n*   **Option D:** `...iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...`. This step attempts to form a diazonium salt before an amine has been generated. This is impossible.\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vii) H₃O+, H₂O/Heat ; viii) dilute H₂SO₄ ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n\nLet's analyze Option C. It contains all the necessary reagents for the valid pathway we derived. It starts correctly with t-butylation and sulfonation. The deblocking step (viii) is placed correctly towards the end. However, the sequence of the middle steps `v) NaNO₂/HCl` and `vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄` appears to be swapped compared to our ideal pathway. As written, it diazotizes the amine and then nitrates the diazonium salt, which, upon analysis, leads to a 1,3,5-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3 product.\n\nThere appears to be a typographical error in Option C. If steps (v) and (vi) were swapped, the sequence would be chemically sound and produce the target molecule, as outlined in our analysis. Given that options A, B, and D contain fundamental and irreparable flaws, Option C represents the correct overall strategy and is the most plausible intended answer, despite the likely typo.\n\n<<<C>>>"
