    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The question asks about distinguishing two energy levels (E1 and E2) based on their lifetimes (τ1 and τ2). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt, which is τ in this case). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations and to find the minimum energy width, we often use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Define \"Clearly Distinguishable\" (Resolvable):** For two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the combined uncertainty or \"width\" of the levels. The total uncertainty is the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n    So, the condition for resolution is:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n5.  **Find the Necessary Constant:** I need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units that will be convenient for the calculation. Since the final answer options are in electron volts (eV), using ħ in eV·s is the most direct approach.\n    *   I'll search for this value. <search>reduced planck constant in eV s</search>\n\n6.  **Process Search Results:** The search will provide the value:\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n7.  **Calculate Individual Energy Uncertainties:**\n    *   For the first state (with the shorter lifetime):\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state (with the longer lifetime):\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    Notice that the state with the *shorter* lifetime has the *larger* energy uncertainty. This makes sense; if a state exists for a very short time, its energy is very \"fuzzy\" or uncertain.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Minimum Energy Difference for Resolution:**\n    *   Apply the resolution condition: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    *   |E1 - E2| > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Let me use the Python interpreter to perform this addition accurately.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\ntau1_s = 1e-9          # Lifetime 1 in seconds\ntau2_s = 1e-8          # Lifetime 2 in seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainties (widths)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1_s\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2_s\n\n# Calculate the total width, which is the minimum energy separation required for resolution\ntotal_delta_E = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference > (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {total_delta_E:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Let's compare the required difference with the options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\nfor label, value in options.items():\n    if value > total_delta_E:\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference because it is greater than {total_delta_E:.4e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to {total_delta_E:.4e} eV.\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): 6.5820e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): 6.5820e-08 eV\nRequired energy difference > (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.2402e-07 eV\nOption A (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to 7.2402e-07 eV.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference because it is greater than 7.2402e-07 eV.\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to 7.2402e-07 eV.\nOption D (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to 7.2402e-07 eV.\n</execute_result>\n\n9.  **Analyze the Result:** The calculation shows that the sum of the energy widths is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.
