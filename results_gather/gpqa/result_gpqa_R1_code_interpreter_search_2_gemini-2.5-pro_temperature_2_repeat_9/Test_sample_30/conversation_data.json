    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a standard nitrating agent, which generates the electrophile, the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n*   **Substrate:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating group and is *ortho*, *para*-directing for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to steric hindrance, the *para* product is formed in greater yield than the *ortho* product. Therefore, Product 1 is predominantly **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    *Structure of Product 1:*\n    A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group at position 1 and a -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the oxidation of the methyl group (-CH₃) on the aromatic ring. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Product 2:** The -CH₃ group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. The nitro group (-NO₂) is stable under these conditions. Thus, Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzoic acid** (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    *Structure of Product 2:*\n    A benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 and a -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid), acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an aldol-type condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Acid-Base Reaction:** Sodium hydroxide, a strong base, first deprotonates the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group in p-nitrobenzoic acid to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    2.  **Aldol Condensation:** Acetone has acidic α-protons. NaOH will also deprotonate an α-proton from acetone to form an enolate anion (⁻CH₂C(O)CH₃).\n    3.  This reaction appears to be a variation of the haloform reaction if a halogen were present, or a self-condensation of acetone. However, in the context of reacting with an aromatic acid, the most plausible intended reaction is a variation of the Darzens or Perkin reaction, or perhaps simply an acid-base reaction.\n    Let's re-examine the reagents. This set of reagents (a carbonyl compound, acetone, and a base, NaOH) acting on p-nitrobenzoic acid might be intended to induce a reaction where the carbanion from acetone attacks the aromatic ring. This is a vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen, but that usually requires an oxidizing agent and works better with electron-poor aromatics.\n    A much simpler and more common reaction is that the acidic p-nitrobenzoic acid will simply be deprotonated by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium p-nitrobenzoate. Acetone in this context might act as the solvent, or it might be intended to undergo a reaction that is less common or misrepresented.\n    However, the most straightforward interpretation is that no complex C-C bond formation occurs. The only reaction is the acid-base reaction between p-nitrobenzoic acid and sodium hydroxide. Acetone serves as the solvent.\n*   **Product 3:** Therefore, Product 3 is the salt of p-nitrobenzoic acid, which is the **p-nitrobenzoate anion**.\n\n    *Structure of Product 3:*\n    A benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at position 1 and a -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n### **Symmetry Analysis of Product 3 (p-nitrobenzoate anion)**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group (point group), we identify the symmetry elements present in the p-nitrobenzoate anion. Let's assume the molecule is planar.\n\n1.  **Identity (E):** Every molecule has this element.\n2.  **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):**\n    *   There is a C₂ axis that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms of the benzene ring and bisects the C-C bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n3.  **Planes of Symmetry (σ):**\n    *   **σᵥ:** There is a vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that is collinear with the C₂ axis and contains the C1-C(O)O, C4-N(O)O atoms and the benzene ring's C1 and C4 atoms. This plane cuts the molecule in half.\n    *   **σ'ᵥ:** There is another vertical mirror plane that is perpendicular to the first one and passes through the C2, C3, C5, and C6 atoms, also bisecting the C-C bonds and the C-N bond.\n    *   **σₕ:** There is a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that is the plane of the molecule itself (the benzene ring and the substituents are planar). This plane reflects the top of the molecule to the bottom and vice versa, leaving it unchanged.\n4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule possesses a center of inversion at the center of the benzene ring. For every atom at coordinates (x, y, z), there is an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z). For example, the two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group are equidistant and on opposite sides of the center, as are the two oxygen atoms of the nitro group. The same applies to the carbon atoms of the ring (C2 and C5; C3 and C6).\n\n**Determining the Point Group:**\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis, two perpendicular σᵥ planes, and a σₕ plane belongs to the **D₂h** point group. The presence of a center of inversion (i) along with the C₂ and σₕ also defines the C₂h group, but the presence of the additional perpendicular mirror planes elevates the symmetry to D₂h.\n\n*   C₂ + σₕ = C₂h point group.\n*   C₂ + two σᵥ planes = C₂v point group.\n*   C₂ + two σᵥ planes + σₕ = D₂h point group.\n\nSince the p-nitrobenzoate anion has all these elements, its point group is D₂h.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) d2h: Correct.\nB) c2h: Incorrect, as there are more symmetry elements than required for C₂h.\nC) cs: Incorrect, this implies only a single mirror plane.\nD) c3: Incorrect, there is no 3-fold rotation axis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
