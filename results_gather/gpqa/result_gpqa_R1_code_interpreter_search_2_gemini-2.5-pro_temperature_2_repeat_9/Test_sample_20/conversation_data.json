    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n**Part 1: Analyze Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** The problem defines tautomerism. The most common form relevant here is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it needs to have at least one α-hydrogen (an alpha-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an α-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons for both ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are the α-carbons.\n    *   In the benzoquinone ring, these α-carbons are part of carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Because they are part of a C=C double bond, they have already formed three bonds within the ring (two single, one double). The fourth bond is to another carbon atom of the ring. They are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone has no α-hydrogens. Therefore, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons, located between the ketone groups.\n    *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3 hybridized and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing ketone groups. The compound readily tautomerizes to its much more stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits strong tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The name describes the structure:\n        *   \"propanoate\": a 3-carbon ester chain.\n        *   \"methyl\": the ester group is -COOCH3.\n        *   \"2-hydroxy\": an -OH group is on carbon-2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to carbon-2 are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   All four of these groups are different.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Carbon-2 is a chiral center. The molecule has no plane of symmetry. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   \"Fumarate\" is the trans isomer of butenedioate. \"Dimethyl\" indicates two methyl ester groups.\n    *   The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration).\n    *   Let's check for chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=C double bond. Also, it has a center of inversion. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, with dimethyl maleate being its cis isomer).\n\n4.  **Result for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism: **Benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism: **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
