    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2).**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is a symmetric molecule, so the two alpha-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Reaction:** α-Bromination\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nThis is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone is treated with a strong base, leading to a ring contraction.\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate).\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the highly strained three-membered ring opens to form a more stable carbanion.\n4.  Protonation of the carbanion by water yields a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n*Alternative Consideration:* An E2 elimination could form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is characteristic for carboxylic acids, not enones. This makes the Favorskii pathway the correct one.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.**\nThis is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride provides the chlorine, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3).**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OtBu)3\n*   **Reaction:** Selective reduction of an acyl chloride to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to determine the number of unique proton environments in this molecule, which corresponds to the number of signals we would expect to see in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the C1 carbon it's attached to, and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring, making C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nWe can now count the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and in a distinct chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The C1 proton:** The single hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) lies on the plane of symmetry. It is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The C2 and C5 protons:**\n    *   C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Each of these carbons is a methylene group (-CH2-). The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This means they are in chemically different environments. Let's call them H-2a and H-2b.\n    *   By symmetry, H-2a is equivalent to H-5a, and H-2b is equivalent to H-5b.\n    *   Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **The C3 and C4 protons:**\n    *   C3 and C4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Similar to C2/C5, the two protons on the C3 methylene group are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    *   By symmetry, the protons on C3 are equivalent to their counterparts on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the types of chemically distinct hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6 types.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4."
