    "Evolving from traditional Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysis, the concept of tandem catalysis has emerged as a sophisticated method for polymer synthesis. In this specific scenario, the goal is to produce a branched polymer using only ethylene as the feedstock. This is achieved by a dual catalyst system where one catalyst selectively oligomerizes ethylene into short-chain α-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), and the second catalyst copolymerizes these in-situ generated α-olefins with the remaining ethylene to create a branched polymer, akin to Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\nLet's evaluate the given statements based on this chemical principle:\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This is correct. The most notable example is the UNIPOL™ II process developed by Univation Technologies (a joint venture of ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical). This process utilizes a mixed catalyst system in a single reactor to produce LLDPE directly from ethylene, where one catalyst component generates the α-olefin comonomer and the other incorporates it. This demonstrates industrial-scale implementation.\n\n*   **B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** Noble metals (like Palladium, Platinum) are known to be active in olefin polymerization and oligomerization. However, systems for generating branched polyethylene from ethylene typically rely on more cost-effective late transition metals like iron, cobalt, or nickel, or early transition metals. While noble metals *could* potentially be engineered for this, they are generally considered prohibitively expensive for large-scale commodity polymer production, making systems based on them economically unviable. This statement is therefore plausible and likely correct from a practical and economic standpoint.\n\n*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. Aluminum-based activators, most famously methylaluminoxane (MAO), are standard and often essential co-catalysts/activators for a wide range of single-site catalysts used in both polymerization and oligomerization, including those based on iron, cobalt, chromium, zirconium, and titanium. They are crucial for generating the active catalytic species. Therefore, the statement that they \"do not work\" is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** Group VIa (now Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). Chromium-based catalysts are very famous for ethylene polymerization (e.g., the Phillips catalyst) and also for selective ethylene oligomerization to 1-hexene or 1-octene (e.g., chromium-PNP pincer catalysts). Therefore, a dual system could very well employ two different chromium catalysts or a chromium catalyst paired with another type, making this statement correct. For instance, a Cr-based catalyst can oligomerize ethylene to 1-hexene, which is then copolymerized with ethylene by a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalyst.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements A and D are demonstrably correct based on established industrial processes and chemical literature. Statement B is correct from a practical economic perspective. Statement C is incorrect. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, sometimes there can be more than one correct statement. However, if we must choose the single best answer, Statement A refers to the direct, large-scale industrial implementation of the *exact process* described—a combined system for producing branched polymer from ethylene in the US. This is a very specific and verifiable fact directly addressing the core of the scientist's inquiry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
