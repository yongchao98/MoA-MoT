    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    When we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2, the common terms (`T_star`, `R_star`, 2, and `(1-A)`) cancel out, because the planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo.\n    `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n    So, the ratio of temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a) and the star's mass (M_star). For a planet with mass `M_p << M_star`, the law is approximately:\n    `P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³`\n    Since `4π²`, `G`, and `M_star` are constant for both planets, we can see that `P²` is proportional to `a³`, or `a` is proportional to `P^(2/3)`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes is:\n    `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine Temperature and Period Ratios:** Now substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((P2 / P1)^(2/3))^(1/2) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Relate Orbital Period to Radial Velocity Data:** We are given the Doppler shifts, which relate to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star). For a circular orbit, this relationship is given by:\n    `K_star = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    The problem states the *maximum* Doppler shift, which implies we are observing the system edge-on, so `sin(i) = 1`.\n    Since `2πG` and `M_star` are the same for both planets, we can write the proportionality:\n    `K_star ∝ M_p / P^(1/3)`\n    Rearranging to solve for the period `P`:\n    `P^(1/3) ∝ M_p / K_star`\n    `P ∝ (M_p / K_star)³`\n\n7.  **Form the Period Ratio:** Now we can find the ratio P2 / P1:\n    `P2 / P1 = (M_p2 / K_star2)³ / (M_p1 / K_star1)³ = ((M_p2 * K_star1) / (M_p1 * K_star2))³`\n\n8.  **Combine Temperature and Full Expression:** Substitute the period ratio from step 7 into the temperature ratio equation from step 5:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [((M_p2 * K_star1) / (M_p1 * K_star2))³]^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 * K_star1) / (M_p1 * K_star2)`\n\n9.  **Relate K_star to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The radial velocity is related to the Doppler shift by `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength. This means `K_star` is directly proportional to `Δλ`.\n    So, we can replace `K_star1` with `Δλ1` and `K_star2` with `Δλ2` in our ratio (the constants `c/λ₀` cancel out).\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 * Δλ1) / (M_p1 * Δλ2)`\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 * 0.03) / (7 * 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.15 / 0.28`\n\n    To get the decimal value, I will perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio based on the derived formula\nM_p1 = 7  # Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 * d_lambda1) / (M_p1 * d_lambda2)\nratio = (M_p2 * d_lambda1) / (M_p1 * d_lambda2)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1-A)$ will cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi G}{P}^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift occurs when $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Since the constant terms ($2\\pi G$, $M_{star}$) are the same for both planets, we have the proportionality:\n$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThe Doppler shift $\\Delta \\lambda$ is related to the radial velocity by the formula $v = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the maximum radial velocity $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta \\lambda$.\n$K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\nSo we can write:\n$\\Delta \\lambda \\propto \\frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the period P:\n$P^{1/3} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta \\lambda} \\implies P \\propto \\left( \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta \\lambda} \\right)^3$\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), we can relate the semi-major axis to the period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\nSubstituting the expression for P:\n$a \\propto \\left( \\left( \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta \\lambda} \\right)^3 \\right)^{2/3} = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta \\lambda} \\right)^2$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/\\Delta \\lambda_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/\\Delta \\lambda_1)^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_1}{M_{p1} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_2} \\right)^2$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{M_{p2} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_1}{M_{p1} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_2} \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{M_{p2} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_1}{M_{p1} \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n$M_{p1} = 7$ M_Earth\n$M_{p2} = 5$ M_Earth\n$\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n$\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 0.03}{7 \\cdot 0.04} = \\frac{0.15}{0.28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
