    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that is completely saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). It could be an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's calculate the expected mass fraction for the general formulas using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28% very well.\n    *   Therefore, substance Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   Both mixture X and mixture Y, upon hydrogenation under severe conditions (H2/Pt), yield *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures (let's call them A and B in mixture X; C and D in mixture Y) must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. For example, if Z is cyclohexane (a six-membered ring), then A, B, C, and D must also be compounds with a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Reaction X → Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), let's set D = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   The reaction that forms Y from X is described as a disproportionation catalyzed by platinum (Pt) with heat. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically refers to a catalytic transfer hydrogenation, where some molecules are dehydrogenated (lose H) while others are hydrogenated (gain H).\n    *   The overall reaction transforms an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} into an equimolar mixture Y = {C, D}. This implies a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction: `A + B → C + D`.\n    *   One product D is the saturated cycloalkane Z (CnH2n). The other product, C, must be the result of dehydrogenation. To not react with bromine water, C must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring (n=6).\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a very common solvent.\n        *   If Z=D=Cyclohexane, then C must be the corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton, which is Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   So, Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. This fits the description: both are liquids, and neither decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   The hydrogenation of this mixture Y would yield only cyclohexane, which is consistent. (Benzene + 3H2 → Cyclohexane; Cyclohexane + H2 → no reaction).\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X = {A, B} is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They do not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A and B react to form Y: `A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   Based on the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. Specifically, let's balance the hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Total H atoms in products = H atoms in C6H6 + H atoms in C6H12\n        *   Total H atoms in products = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n        *   H atoms in A + H atoms in B = 18.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n6.  **Verify the identity of A and B (Optional but recommended).**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons include Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits.\n    *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: `C6H8 + C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H12`. This is balanced; 2 hydrogen atoms are transferred from cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene. This seems counter-intuitive, let's check the other way. `C6H10 (donor) + C6H8 (acceptor)` leads to `C6H6 + C6H12` implies a transfer of 4H, which is not balanced for a 1:1 reaction. Let's recheck the hydrogen transfer logic.\n    *   Let A = C6H10 and B = C6H8. A is the H-donor, B is the H-acceptor. The products are C=C6H6, D=C6H12. This cannot happen via A->C and B->D in a single step, as the H atom changes dont match.\n    *   The description is \"disproportionation\". It's a disproportionation of the H content of the mixture. Let's not overthink the mechanism, but stick to the overall balance which must hold true.\n        `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. The total atoms C=12, H=18 are balanced on both sides. This is a valid overall reaction for an equimolar conversion.\n    *   The constraint \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" requires that if B is C6H8, it must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, not the conjugated 1,3-Cyclohexadiene. This fits all the given information.\n\n*Note: A similar logical path could be constructed for n=7, leading to Z=Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) and X={Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}, giving a total H count of 22. However, the C6 system (Cyclohexane/Benzene) is a more fundamental and classic example in chemistry, and cyclohexane is arguably a more \"widely used\" generic solvent in the context of being a chemical staple (e.g., nylon precursor), making the C6 case the most probable intended answer.*\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in the products, which is 6 + 12 = 18."
