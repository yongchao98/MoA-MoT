    "This is a problem about conditional probability in the context of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already survived.\n\n**Step 1: Define the model for radioactive decay.**\nThe probability that an atom has not decayed by time *t* is given by the survival function S(t):\nS(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere *T* is the lifetime of the atom and *λ* is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays by time *t* is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF), F(t):\nF(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find the decay constant λ.**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\nUsing the CDF formula:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nWe can calculate the numerical value of λ, but it's often more accurate to keep it in this symbolic form for later calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the question in terms of conditional probability.**\nWe are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nLet A be the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, i.e., between t=50 and t=50+150=200. This can be written as 50 < T ≤ 200.\nLet B be the event that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, i.e., T > 50.\n\nWe want to find the conditional probability P(A | B) = P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula for conditional probability.**\nThe formula for conditional probability is P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).\nThe event \"A and B\" (A ∩ B) means the atom survives past t=50 AND decays before t=200. This is the same as the event A, i.e., 50 < T ≤ 200.\nSo, we need to calculate P(50 < T ≤ 200) / P(T > 50).\n\n*   **Calculate the numerator:** P(50 < T ≤ 200)\n    This is the probability of decaying in the interval (50, 200].\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200) = P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200) = (1 - e^(-200λ)) - (1 - e^(-50λ))\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200) = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)\n\n*   **Calculate the denominator:** P(T > 50)\n    This is the probability of surviving past 50 minutes.\n    P(T > 50) = e^(-50λ)\n\n*   **Calculate the conditional probability:**\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) / e^(-50λ)\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = 1 - (e^(-200λ) / e^(-50λ))\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = 1 - e^(-200λ + 50λ)\n    P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\nThis result demonstrates the memoryless property: the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given survival up to t=50, is the same as the probability of a fresh atom decaying in the first 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the value of λ and compute the final answer.**\nNow, substitute λ = -ln(0.68) / 100 into the expression 1 - e^(-150λ).\nProbability = 1 - exp(-150 * [-ln(0.68) / 100])\nProbability = 1 - exp(1.5 * ln(0.68))\nUsing the logarithm property x * ln(y) = ln(y^x):\nProbability = 1 - exp(ln(0.68^1.5))\nSince exp(ln(z)) = z:\nProbability = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow we can perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We know P(decay in next 150 min | survived 50 min) = 1 - 0.68**1.5\nprob = 1 - 0.68**1.5\n# Multiply by 100 to express as a percentage\npercentage_prob = prob * 100\nprint(f'{percentage_prob:.1f}')\n```\n```output\n44.0\n```\nThe calculation shows that the probability is 44.0%.

    "The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: Radioactive decay is a random process. For a single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in any given time interval is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that is memoryless. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. This process is mathematically described by the exponential distribution.\n\n*   The probability that an atom has **not** decayed by time *t* (the survival probability) is given by the survival function, S(t):\n    S(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where *λ* is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific type of atom.\n*   The probability that the atom **has** decayed by time *t* is given by the cumulative distribution function, F(t):\n    F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are told that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n\n*   P(decay in 100 minutes) = F(100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ explicitly, we would take the natural logarithm:\n\n*   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**3. Formulate the Specific Question**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability.\n\n*   Let A be the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=50+150=200). So, 50 < T ≤ 200.\n*   Let B be the event that the atom has survived for 50 minutes. So, T > 50.\n*   We want to find P(A | B), or P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n**4. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes (event B) has no impact on its future decay probability. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a brand new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n*   P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to calculating P(T ≤ 150).\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate F(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150). We can do this using the information we found in Step 2.\n\n*   Probability = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n*   Substitute the expression for λ: Probability = 1 - e^(-150 * [-ln(0.68) / 100])\n*   Simplify the exponent: Probability = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n*   Using the logarithm power rule (a * ln(x) = ln(x^a)): Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n*   Since the exponential and natural log functions are inverses (e^ln(x) = x): Probability = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate 1 - 0.68**1.5\n# This is equivalent to 1 - exp(1.5 * ln(0.68)), which is more fundamental.\n\n# Let's calculate the decay constant lambda first for clarity.\n# exp(-100 * lambda) = 0.68  => -100 * lambda = ln(0.68)\nlambda_const = -math.log(0.68) / 100\n\n# The required probability is P(T <= 150), which is 1 - exp(-150 * lambda)\nprobability = 1 - math.exp(-150 * lambda_const)\n\n# Convert to percentage\nprobability_percent = probability * 100\n\nprint(probability_percent)\n```\n```output\n43.92576349159981\n```\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%.

    "Based on the repeated and consistent calculations, the probability is determined as follows:\n\n1.  The probability of decay within a certain time follows an exponential distribution, which has a \"memoryless\" property. This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future probability of decay.\n2.  Therefore, the question simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n3.  We are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n4.  The probability of survival for a time *t* is given by `P(t) = S^t`, where `S` is the survival probability for one unit of time. If we take 100 minutes as our unit, the survival probability for that unit is 0.68.\n5.  The probability of survival for 150 minutes is the survival probability for 1.5 of these units, which is `(0.68)^1.5`.\n6.  The calculation `(0.68)^1.5` is approximately `0.5607`. This is the probability the atom will *survive* the next 150 minutes.\n7.  The probability that it will *decay* in the next 150 minutes is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n8.  Converting this to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\nThis value is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
