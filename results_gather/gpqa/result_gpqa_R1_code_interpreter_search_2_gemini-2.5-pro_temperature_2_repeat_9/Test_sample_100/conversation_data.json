    "**1. Analyze the Reaction and Product Structure**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction starts with `3-methylpyrrolidine`, which is a secondary amine (R₂NH). It reacts with an unknown reagent `A`.\n*   **Product:** The final product is `1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine`.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The formation of a C=C bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom from a secondary amine and another reactant (A) strongly suggests a Stork enamine synthesis. Enamines are formed by the acid-catalyzed condensation of a secondary amine with a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone).\n*   **Product Structure Analysis:** Let's break down the IUPAC name: `1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine`.\n    *   The parent structure is `3-methylpyrrolidine`.\n    *   The substituent is on the nitrogen atom (position `1-`).\n    *   The substituent is `cyclohexylidenemethyl`. This group is `C₆H₁₀=CH-`. The `ylidene` suffix indicates a double bond from the cyclohexane ring to the group it's attached to (the `methyl` group, which is a `CH` in this context).\n    *   So, the final structure is a 3-methylpyrrolidine ring where the nitrogen atom is bonded to a `CH` group, and that `CH` group is double-bonded to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The resulting functional group is `(Pyrrolidine)-N-CH=C(cyclohexane)`, which is an enamine (`N-C=C`).\n\n**2. Determine Reagent A (the Carbonyl Compound)**\n\n*   Enamine synthesis is a dehydration reaction. To determine the starting carbonyl compound, we can conceptually reverse the reaction by adding a water molecule (H₂O) across the enamine double bond.\n*   Hydrolysis of an enamine (`R₂N-CR'=CR''₂`) yields the original amine (`R₂NH`) and carbonyl compound (`O=CR'-CHR''₂`).\n*   Product: `(3-methylpyrrolidine)-N - CH = C(in cyclohexane ring)`\n*   Reversing the reaction:\n    *   The `(3-methylpyrrolidine)-N` part becomes `3-methylpyrrolidine` (the starting amine).\n    *   The `-CH=C(in cyclohexane ring)` part becomes the carbonyl compound. The nitrogen was attached to the `CH` carbon, so that carbon must have been the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   `O=CH - CH(in cyclohexane ring)`\n    *   This structure is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   Therefore, reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This eliminates options C and D, which list `vinylcyclohexane`. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and would not undergo this type of condensation reaction.\n\n**3. Determine Catalyst B (the Acid Catalyst)**\n\n*   The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration. We need to choose between Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH).\n*   **Acetic Acid:** A weak carboxylic acid (pKa ≈ 4.76). It can act as a catalyst.\n*   **TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid):** A strong sulfonic acid (pKa ≈ -2.8).\n*   The key step that requires catalysis is the dehydration of the carbinolamine intermediate (`R₂N-CH(OH)-R'`). This step involves protonating the `-OH` group to make it a better leaving group (`-OH₂⁺`).\n*   Strong acids like TsOH are much more effective at protonating the hydroxyl group than weak acids like acetic acid.\n*   Furthermore, enamine formation is an equilibrium reaction. To drive the reaction to completion, the water produced is typically removed, for example, by using a Dean-Stark apparatus with a solvent like toluene. In this setup, a strong, non-volatile acid catalyst like TsOH is ideal. It provides efficient catalysis without being removed with the water.\n*   While a weak acid might be chosen in some cases to avoid complete protonation of the starting amine nucleophile, using a catalytic amount of a strong acid like TsOH is the standard, most effective method for the Stork enamine synthesis.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Reagent A is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n*   Catalyst B is **TsOH**, as it is a strong acid catalyst that is standard for promoting dehydration reactions like enamine synthesis.\n*   This combination matches option B.\n\nThe final reaction is:\n3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde --(TsOH, Heat)--> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine + H₂O\n\n<<<B>>>"
