    "This is a titration problem involving a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid.**\n- Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):\n  Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n- The initial volume is 20.00 cm³. It's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n- Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n- Concentration of diluted acetic acid ([HA]_initial):\n  Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n- The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n- At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n- Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.\n- Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n- At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.\n- This means that the ratio of the formed conjugate base ([A⁻], CH₃COO⁻) to the remaining acid ([HA], CH₃COOH) is 25% / (100% - 25%) = 25/75 = 1/3.\n- This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n  pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n- First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n  pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n- Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n  pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)\n\nLet's compute the value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\n```\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n- At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n- The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n  Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n- The concentration of the conjugate base, acetate ([A⁻]), is:\n  [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n- The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n  CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n- We need to calculate the concentration of OH⁻ produced. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n  Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw (the ion product of water at 25°C) is 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n  Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n- Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction:\n  CH₃COO⁻     + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n  Initial:    0.02 M               0          0\n  Change:     -x                  +x         +x\n  Equil:   (0.02 - x)              x          x\n- Write the expression for Kb:\n  Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n- Since Kb is small, we can assume x is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n  Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n- Solve for x, which is [OH⁻]:\n  x² = Kb * 0.02 = [(1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)] * 0.02\n  x = [OH⁻]\n\nLet's compute the pH at the equivalence point.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_A_minus = 0.02  # Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n```\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The first calculation for the pH at 25% titration has been completed and resulted in pH = 4.26.\n\nNow, let's proceed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n**Recap of Equivalence Point Conditions:**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   At the equivalence point, 0.001 mol of NaOH has been added.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume of solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   All the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.\n*   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n**Calculating pH at the Equivalence Point:**\nThe acetate ion (a weak base) hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we must first find the concentration of OH⁻ produced from this hydrolysis. We will use an ICE table and the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n\n1.  **Find Kb:**\n    *   We know Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    *   The relationship between Ka, Kb, and the ion product of water (Kw) is Ka * Kb = Kw.\n    *   At 25°C, Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n\n2.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   From the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] is also x, and [CH₃COO⁻] is (0.02 - x).\n    *   Kb = x² / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb will be very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, simplifying the equation to Kb ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ Kb * 0.02\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ sqrt(Kb * 0.02).\n\n3.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nLet's compute this value using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw_water = 1.0e-14\nconc_acetate = 0.02  # Molarity of acetate at equivalence point\n\n# 1. Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw_water / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# 2. Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-]\n# We solve x = [OH-] from the approximation Kb = x^2 / [acetate]\nhydroxide_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# 3. Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(hydroxide_concentration)\n\n# 4. Calculate pH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n```\nThe calculations show:\n*   pH at 25% titration = 4.26\n*   pH at the equivalence point = 8.52\n\nThese results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Excellent, the calculations for both required points in the titration are now complete. Let's summarize the process and confirm the final answer.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning and Calculations**\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n    *   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region, where both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), are present. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is ideal here: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   **pKa:** First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka value.\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   **Ratio:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   **pH Calculation:**\n        *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253\n        *   The precise calculation performed by the code was **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n    *   **Volume:** We needed to add 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to reach the equivalence point. The total volume is 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³.\n    *   **Concentration:** The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] is 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   **pH Calculation:** We calculated the Kb for acetate (Kb = Kw/Ka), then found the [OH⁻] produced from the hydrolysis of the 0.02 M acetate solution. From [OH⁻], we calculated the pOH and then the pH.\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   The precise calculation performed by the code yielded a pH of **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point. These values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
