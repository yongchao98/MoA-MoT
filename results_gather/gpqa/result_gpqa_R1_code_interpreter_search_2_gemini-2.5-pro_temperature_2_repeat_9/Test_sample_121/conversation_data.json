    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to find the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   Starting material: CH₃COOH\n    *   The α-carbon is the methyl group.\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH₂-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH --(H⁺)--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion (Br⁻) in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br). This is a multi-step process analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for forming rings.\n    *   **a) Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-protons (the CH₂ group) because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base NaH removes one of these protons.\n        NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b) First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c) Second Deprotonation:** The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-proton. Since *excess* NaH is used, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d) Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion formed is at one end of the molecule, and a bromine leaving group is at the other. It undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a cyclic compound. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Final Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\n```\n      EtOOC     CN\n           \\   /\n            C1\n           / \\\n      H₂C6   C2H₂\n      |      |\n      H₂C5---C3H₂\n           \\ /\n           C4H₂\n```\nTo find the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a molecular symmetry operation (like a plane or axis of symmetry) or by a rapid conformational change.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is substituted at C1 with two *different* groups: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Because the two substituents are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis. For example, a plane of symmetry that might pass through C1 and C4 in a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane is only possible if the two substituents are identical.\n    *   The lack of symmetry means that ring positions that would be equivalent in a more symmetric molecule are now distinct. Specifically:\n        *   The environment of C2 is different from C6.\n        *   The environment of C3 is different from C5.\n        *   C4 has a unique environment.\n\n2.  **Counting the Proton Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (CH₃) group are equivalent to each other. This is **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (CH₂) group are equivalent to each other. This is **1 signal**.\n        *   Total from ethyl group = **2 signals**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since there is no symmetry, all five methylene carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n        *   Furthermore, on *each* of these methylene carbons, the two geminal protons (e.g., the axial and equatorial protons in a chair conformation) are not equivalent. They are **diastereotopic** because substitution of one versus the other would lead to diastereomers. Diastereotopic protons have different chemical shifts.\n        *   Therefore, each of the five methylene groups on the ring contributes **2 distinct proton signals**.\n        *   Number of signals from C2: 2\n        *   Number of signals from C3: 2\n        *   Number of signals from C4: 2\n        *   Number of signals from C5: 2\n        *   Number of signals from C6: 2\n        *   Total from cyclohexane ring = 5 × 2 = **10 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = **12 distinct signals**.\n\nWhile some of these signals might be very close in chemical shift and overlap in a real spectrum (especially at lower field strengths), the question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe options are A) 12, B) 8, C) 10, D) 5.\nOur rigorous analysis leads to 12 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
