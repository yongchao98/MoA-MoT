    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). To find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n- The decay process is: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n- The Pi(+) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n- Rest mass energy of Pi(+), `M_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV.\n- Rest mass energy of mu(+), `M_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV.\n- The neutrino (nu) is considered to have zero rest mass, `M_nu * c^2` = 0.\n\n**2. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n**a) Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n- **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the Pi(+) is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n  `E_initial = M_pi * c^2`\n\n- **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy.\n  `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + M_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + M_nu * c^2)`\n  Since `M_nu = 0`, this simplifies to:\n  `E_final = (KE_mu + M_mu * c^2) + KE_nu`\n\n- **Equating initial and final energy:**\n  `M_pi * c^2 = KE_mu + M_mu * c^2 + KE_nu`\n  Rearranging for the sum of the kinetic energies gives:\n  `KE_mu + KE_nu = (M_pi - M_mu) * c^2` (Equation 1)\n  This quantity, `(M_pi - M_mu) * c^2`, is the total kinetic energy released in the decay, often called the Q-value.\n\n**b) Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n- **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** The Pi(+) is stationary, so `p_initial = 0`.\n- **Final Momentum (p_final):** Since there are only two product particles, they must travel in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Therefore, the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal.\n  `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p` (Equation 2)\n\n**3. Relating Energy and Momentum:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M*c^2)^2`.\n\n- **For the neutrino (massless):**\n  `E_nu^2 = (p_nu*c)^2 + (M_nu*c^2)^2`\n  Since `M_nu = 0` and `p_nu = p`, this becomes `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2`.\n  Also, for a massless particle, `E_nu = KE_nu`. So, `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n- **For the muon:**\n  We can express `(p*c)^2` in terms of the muon's kinetic energy.\n  `E_mu = KE_mu + M_mu * c^2`\n  `(KE_mu + M_mu * c^2)^2 = (p_mu*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n  `(p_mu*c)^2 = (KE_mu + M_mu * c^2)^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2`\n  `(p*c)^2 = KE_mu^2 + 2*KE_mu*(M_mu * c^2)`\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe now have two expressions for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(p*c)^2 = KE_nu^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = KE_mu^2 + 2*KE_mu*(M_mu * c^2)`\n\nEquating them gives:\n`KE_nu^2 = KE_mu^2 + 2*KE_mu*(M_mu * c^2)`\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can write `KE_nu = (M_pi - M_mu) * c^2 - KE_mu`. Substituting this into the equation above:\n`((M_pi - M_mu) * c^2 - KE_mu)^2 = KE_mu^2 + 2*KE_mu*(M_mu * c^2)`\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation leads to a direct formula for the muon's kinetic energy:\n`KE_mu = ((M_pi - M_mu) * c^2)^2 / (2 * M_pi * c^2)`\n`KE_mu = (M_pi * c^2 - M_mu * c^2)^2 / (2 * M_pi * c^2)`\n\nWe will now calculate the values using a Python script.\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# Formula: KE_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)^2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Q = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy\n# KE_nu = Q - KE_mu\nke_nu = q_value - ke_mu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE_mu: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE_nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nKE_mu: 4.12 MeV\nKE_nu: 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon (`mu+`) is 4.12 MeV.\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the neutrino (`nu`) is 29.78 MeV, which can be rounded to 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are therefore 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the conservation of energy and momentum in this particle decay, we have established the following relationships:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy released as kinetic energy is `KE_total = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2 = KE_mu + KE_nu`.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n3.  **Kinetic Energy Calculation:** Using the principles of special relativity, we derived the formula for the kinetic energy of the heavier product particle (the muon):\n    `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2)^2 / (2 * m_pi * c^2)`\n\nThe Python script executed these calculations with the given values:\n*   Rest mass energy of Pi(+), `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of mu(+), `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n\nThe output from the code shows:\n*   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n*   `KE_nu` = 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (`KE_nu`) is the remaining energy from the total kinetic energy available (`KE_total = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9` MeV).\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78` MeV.\n\nComparing these calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n*   B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n*   C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n*   D) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.12 MeV and ~29.8 MeV) match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
