    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Goal:**\n    The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). The term \"grounded\" implies that the electric potential on the surface of the sphere is held at zero (V=0). We need to calculate the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **The Method of Images:**\n    The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the interaction between the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the surface of the original sphere) is met.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Position:** `d'` is the distance from the center, located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The position is `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n    This arrangement ensures that the potential at any point on the surface `r=R` is zero.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\n    where `q_i` are the charges in the system, and `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n    In our original system, the charges are the point charge `q` and the continuous induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere. So, the energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + ∫_sphere σ * V_on_sphere * dS]`\n\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the entire integral term becomes zero.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n    Here, `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the point charge `q` created by all other charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n5.  **Using the Image Charge to find V_at_q:**\n    The method of images tells us that the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    So, `V_at_q` (potential due to induced charge) is equal to the potential created by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d'`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of Potential Energy (U):**\n    Now, substitute this expression for `V_at_q` back into our simplified energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This result matches option A. Note that the potential energy is negative, which indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
