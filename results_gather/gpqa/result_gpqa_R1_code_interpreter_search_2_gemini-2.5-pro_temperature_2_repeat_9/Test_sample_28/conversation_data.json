    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene. This means we need to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective way to do this is to ensure that a functional protein product can no longer be translated from the gene's mRNA.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects**\n\nThere are several types of mutations, but the ones most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein are:\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in a DNA codon that results in a premature STOP codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes translation to halt, producing a shortened, truncated protein that is almost always non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is *not* a multiple of three. This shifts the entire \"reading frame\" of the codons that follow, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon shortly after the mutation.\n\nOther mutations, like missense (changes one amino acid) or in-frame deletions (deletes a whole codon/amino acid), are less certain to abolish function completely. The protein is still produced at full length (or nearly full length) and might retain some or all of its activity.\n\n### **3. Examine the Intact Gene's Sequence**\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame and initial amino acid sequence of the original, intact gene. We group the DNA sequence into three-letter codons:\n\n*   **Intact Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n*   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...`\n\n### **4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\nNow, we'll apply the same codon grouping to each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the resulting protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. While this *could* disrupt protein function, it's not guaranteed. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - STOP`\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`. **TAA is a STOP codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (`Met-Phe`). This peptide will not be able to perform the function of the original, much larger enzyme. This is a definitive knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutant contains multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) to `GTC` (Val). These are **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this results in a full-length protein with a few changed amino acids. Function may or may not be lost.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing the raw sequence string to the intact one, we see it is shorter by 3 nucleotides. A likely interpretation is an **in-frame deletion**, where an entire codon (like `GGT`) has been removed, in addition to a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`). This removes one amino acid from the protein but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation and less likely to guarantee a loss of function.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature STOP codon. This nonsense mutation will truncate the protein at a very early stage, which is the most certain way among the given options to produce a non-functional protein and thereby eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
