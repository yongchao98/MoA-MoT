    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\nTo determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to check if the molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  The presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). A stereocenter is typically an sp3 hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  The absence of a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\nA compound with a single stereocenter is always chiral. A compound with multiple stereocenters can be chiral or achiral. If it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is called a meso compound and is achiral, hence optically inactive. Compounds named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S) are given as single stereoisomers. A sample of a single chiral stereoisomer is always optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All the atoms directly involved in the double bond and the atoms attached to them lie in a single plane (Cl, H, C1, C2, the C of CH3, and the C of CH2CH3).\n    *   This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS). This indicates that the molecule has at least two chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, and this name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer of a compound with multiple chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal symmetry that makes them achiral.\n    *   Given the complexity of the molecule and the specific (R,S) designation without any mention of \"meso\", it is standard to assume it refers to a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H, CH3, COOH, C3-group`) and C3 (`H, CH3, COOH, C2-group`) are identical.\n    *   When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (R,S) or (S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one of its conformations, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   This is the diastereomer where both identical chiral centers have the same configuration (R,R). Its enantiomer is the (S,S) form.\n    *   The (R,R) isomer does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   As a pure enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH=CH-CH2-` path around the ring. These two paths are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has a single chiral center, so it is inherently chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer, which is a single chiral stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor (1s,3s,5s) refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule. If we draw the ring flat, all three OH groups can be pointing up. This structure has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, its attached OH group, and C4. This plane reflects C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 are identically substituted (both have an OH group \"up\"), the molecule is symmetric with respect to this plane. In fact, it has three such planes of symmetry.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. (C5H9 is a cyclopentyl group).\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n    *   None of the carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 and thus not chiral.\n    *   The CH2 carbon is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms, so it's not chiral.\n    *   The CH carbon is bonded to an H, a `-CH2C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two identical `-CH3` groups. Since two of the groups are identical, this carbon is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
