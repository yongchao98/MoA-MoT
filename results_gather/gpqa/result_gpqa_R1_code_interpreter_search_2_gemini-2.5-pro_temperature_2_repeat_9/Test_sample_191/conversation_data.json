    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Induction:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, this internal charge will induce charges on the conductor's surfaces. To understand this, imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our imaginary Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the net flux is proportional to the enclosed charge ($\\Phi_E = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$). For the flux to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($Q_{inner}$). So, $+q + Q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $Q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner wall of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation on the Conductor:**\n    *   The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. The charges on it have only been rearranged.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface. This total must remain zero.\n    *   $Q_{conductor} = Q_{inner} + Q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting $Q_{inner} = -q$, we get $-q + Q_{outer} = 0$, which means $Q_{outer} = +q$. A charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding and Field Outside:**\n    *   A key property of a conductor is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner surface) will not affect the electric field *outside* the conductor, because the conductor itself rearranges its charges to cancel their field within its bulk.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface, $+q$, is what creates the electric field in the region outside the conductor.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself *uniformly* over the surface, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge within it. The spherical symmetry of the conductor dictates a uniform charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n4.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:**\n    *   The shell theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like our uniform shell of charge $+q$ on the outer surface) is identical to the field that would be created if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In this problem:\n        *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n        *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n        *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:**\n    *   Treating the $+q$ charge on the outer surface as a point charge at the center O, we can use Coulomb's Law to find the magnitude of the electric field at point P.\n    *   $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    *   $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The magnitude of the electric field at point P depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$). All the other parameters provided in the problem ($r$, $s$, $l$, $\\theta$), which describe the geometry of the cavity and the charge within it, are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the electric field is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
