    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both unknown compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, we check that all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (All three isomers fit).\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Fits).\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected signals for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent, but because they are chemically equivalent, they appear as **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at H-4 and H-6 are in different chemical environments. This will result in **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. This will result in **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the benzene ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (from the -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (from the -CH3 groups). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture based on the Predictions**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds from the remaining three (1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,4-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB) that matches the given spectrum.\n\n**Aromatic Signals:**\nThe spectrum has **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   A 1:1 mixture of two compounds that *each* give one aromatic singlet (for 2H) will produce two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), provided their chemical shifts are different.\n*   The pair **1,2,4,5-TMB** and **1,2,3,4-TMB** fits this criterion.\n*   Any combination involving **1,2,3,5-TMB** is problematic. This compound itself produces two 1H aromatic singlets. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-TMB (which has one 2H singlet), the resulting spectrum would have three singlets or, in case of an accidental overlap, signals with an integration ratio of (2H+1H):1H = 3:1, not 1:1. Thus, we can eliminate options A and B.\n\n**Alkyl Signals:**\nThe spectrum has **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\nLet's analyze the total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture. Each molecule has 12 alkyl protons, so the total is 12 + 12 = 24 protons.\nA 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts. The integration for each signal will be:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n\nSo we are looking for a combination that produces three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining possible pair: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-TMB** provides: **one singlet of 12H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-TMB** provides: **two singlets of 6H each**.\n\nCombining these in a mixture gives exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture would exhibit two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
