    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of binary system_1 to the total mass of binary system_2 (M1_total / M2_total).\n\n### 2. Gather the Given Information\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n    *   Velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n    *   Velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n### 3. Determine the Relevant Physics and Formula\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * (sin(i))^3)\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. An eclipse can only occur if the orbital plane is very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore (sin(i))^3 ≈ 1.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total mass of two spectroscopic binary star systems. The key formula for the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is derived from Kepler's Third Law and Doppler shift measurements:\n\n`M_total = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the observer's line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" Eclipses occur when one star passes in front of the other from our perspective. This is only possible if the inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and thus `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation considerably, and more importantly, allows us to compare the two systems directly without needing the exact value of `i`.\n\n**2. Set up the Mass Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M1_total`) to the mass of system 2 (`M2_total`).\n\nLet's write the simplified mass formula for each system:\n*   For system 1: `M1_total = P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G)`\n*   For system 2: `M2_total = P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G)`\n\nNow, we can create the ratio `M1_total / M2_total`. The constant term `(2 * π * G)` will cancel out:\n\n`M1_total / M2_total = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n`M1_total / M2_total = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³`\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in the numbers from the problem description:\n\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n*   `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\nNow substitute these into the ratio formula:\n\n`M1_total / M2_total = (2 / 1) * [ (15) / (25) ]³`\n\n**4. Calculate the Result**\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:\n`15 / 25 = 3 / 5`\n\nNow, cube this fraction:\n`(3 / 5)³ = 3³ / 5³ = 27 / 125`\n\nFinally, multiply by the ratio of the periods:\n`M1_total / M2_total = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125`\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n`54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation, confirmed by the python code output (`0.432`), shows that the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
