    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin operator is `S = (ħ/2) * σ`, where `σ` are the Pauli matrices. The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat`. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field, which means it is in the spin-up eigenstate of `S_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state vector is:\n    `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_new = B * y_hat`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\n*   The spin operator `S_y` is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   So, the new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n`<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: The Schrödinger Picture (Evolving State Vector)\n\n1.  **Find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian `H`**.\n    The Hamiltonian is proportional to `S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   Eigenstate `|+y>` has eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. `|+y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [i]]`.\n    *   Eigenstate `|-y>` has eigenvalue `-ħ/2`. `|-y> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-i]]`.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues of `H = -γBS_y` are:\n    *   `E_+` (for state `|+y>`): `-γB * (+ħ/2) = -ħγB/2`\n    *   `E_-` (for state `|-y>`): `-γB * (-ħ/2) = +ħγB/2`\n\n    The energy difference is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = ħγB`.\n\n2.  **Express the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the new energy eigenstates.**\n    `|+z> = c_+ |+y> + c_- |-y>`\n    `c_+ = <+y | +z> = (1/√2) * [[1, -i]] * [[1], [0]] = 1/√2`\n    `c_- = <-y | +z> = (1/√2) * [[1, i]] * [[1], [0]] = 1/√2`\n    So, `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n3.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (exp(-iE_+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_- t/ħ)|-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>)`\n\n4.  **Calculate `<S_z(t)>`.**\n    The expectation value `<S_z(t)>` will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n    `ω = (E_- - E_+)/ħ = (ħγB)/ħ = γB`.\n\n    We can also compute the full expression for `<S_z(t)>`:\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   We substitute the expressions for `|ψ(t)>`, `S_z`, `|+y>`, and `|-y>`. After some algebra (involving `cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x)`), we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    This is a cosine oscillation. The term multiplying time `t` inside the cosine is the angular frequency `ω`.\n    Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: The Heisenberg Picture (Larmor Precession)\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `S` in a magnetic field `B` is:\n`d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B)`\n\n1.  Our new field is `B = (0, B, 0)`. The equations for the components of `<S>` are:\n    *   `d<S_x>/dt = γ(<S_y>B - <S_z>*0) = γB<S_y>`  - Oops, let's re-calculate the cross product `S x B`:\n        `S x B = (S_y B_z - S_z B_y, S_z B_x - S_x B_z, S_x B_y - S_y B_x)`.\n        With `B = (0, B, 0)`, this becomes `(-S_z B, 0, S_x B)`.\n    *   So, the equations of motion are:\n        *   `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n        *   `d<S_y>/dt = 0`\n        *   `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n\n2.  We want to find the oscillation of `<S_z>`. Let's take the time derivative of the third equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n\n3.  Substitute the first equation into this one:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n4.  This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`.\n    By comparing the equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
