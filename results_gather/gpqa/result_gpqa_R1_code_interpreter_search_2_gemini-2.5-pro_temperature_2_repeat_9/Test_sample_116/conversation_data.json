    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other features, such as restricted rotation about a single bond, leading to a chiral axis (atropisomerism).\n\n*   **Evaluation of Each Compound**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a C-C single bond. In this molecule, the positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n        *   **Chirality:** The bulky substituents at the ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Because of this restricted rotation, the two rings are forced to be non-planar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This type of chirality is known as axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate):**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl groups.\n        *   **Chirality:** The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and includes the C=O bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is essentially planar. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: Geometric isomerism, cis-trans, is present, but this is different from optical isomerism).\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compound **1** (due to atropisomerism) and compound **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and will not.\n\n    Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
