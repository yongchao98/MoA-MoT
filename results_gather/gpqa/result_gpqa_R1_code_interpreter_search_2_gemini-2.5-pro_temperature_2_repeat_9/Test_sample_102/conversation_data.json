    "Here is a detailed reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are meta with respect to each other.\n*   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and meta-directing.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but ortho,para-directing.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and meta-directing.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Potential Simple Synthesis Routes\n\nA straightforward approach would be sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution. Let's consider the possible orders.\n\n*   **Path A: Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n    1.  Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone (-COCH₃ is a meta-director).\n    2.  Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position. This step is efficient).\n    3.  3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are meta-directors and both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. The reaction is highly regioselective, but the ring is very deactivated by two groups, making the reaction slow and requiring harsh conditions. This might not be considered \"high-yield\" in terms of rate.\n\n*   **Path B: Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n    1.  Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone (-COCH₃ is a meta-director).\n    2.  Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone (The acetyl group directs bromine to the meta position. This works well).\n    3.  3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → In this step, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH₃ at C1) is a meta-director (directs to C5). The bromo group (-Br at C3) is an ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are in conflict. The bromo group is a deactivating o,p-director, while the acetyl group is a stronger deactivating m-director. The directing effect of the bromo group usually dominates in terms of position, leading to substitution ortho/para to it. Therefore, the major products would be the 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the desired 5-nitro isomer. This path would not give a high yield of the desired product.\n\nSince the simple paths are problematic, especially for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we should look for a more sophisticated route, likely involving the manipulation of directing groups. The presence of steps like reduction (Fe/HCl) and diazotization/deamination (NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) in the options strongly suggests such a strategy, where an amino group is used as a temporary director and then removed.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nLet's analyze the options based on the idea of a complex but regiochemically controlled synthesis.\n\n**Option A & D:** These options start by forming aniline (i, ii) and then attempt a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii in D, step vi in A). Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on anilines because the amino group (-NH₂) is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. Therefore, these sequences are chemically flawed at that step.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration, yielding a mixture of o/p-isomers. Subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobromobenzene ring. This path is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** This sequence seems convoluted but let's trace it step-by-step.\n*   **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**. A good starting point.\n*   **ii) Br₂/FeBr₃:** Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**. As established, this is a good regioselective step. The -COCH₃ directs meta.\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. As analyzed in \"Path B\", this step gives low selectivity for the desired 5-nitro isomer. The major product would be the 4-nitro (and 6-nitro) isomer. Let's assume we proceed with the major (but undesired for a direct synthesis) isomer: **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's call this molecule **(W)**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group in **W**. This converts the -NO₂ group to an amino (-NH₂) group. W → **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's call this amine **(WA)**.\n*   **v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of amine **(WA)**. Now we determine where the new nitro group will go. The substituents on the ring are: -COCH₃ (at C1, m-director), -Br (at C3, o,p-director), and -NH₂ (at C4, strongly activating o,p-director).\n    *   The powerful amino group at C4 directs to its ortho positions: C3 (blocked by Br) and C5. So it strongly directs to **C5**.\n    *   The acetyl group at C1 directs to its meta positions: C3 (blocked) and C5. So it also directs to **C5**.\n    *   Since the strongest activating group (-NH₂) and the meta-directing group (-COCH₃) both reinforce substitution at position C5, the nitration will happen there with high selectivity.\n    *   Product: **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **vi) NaNO₂/HCl:** This reagent converts the primary amino group (-NH₂) at C4 into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n*   **vii) H₃PO₂:** Hypophosphorous acid reduces the diazonium salt, replacing it with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nRemoving the amino group from C4 leaves the final, desired product: **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis elaborate sequence cleverly uses a substituent (the nitro group added in step iii) as a precursor to a powerful directing group (the amino group from step iv), which then perfectly controls the regiochemistry of the final nitration (step v). The temporary directing group is then removed (steps vi and vii) to yield the final product. This strategy overcomes the poor selectivity of the direct nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone and thus constitutes a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
