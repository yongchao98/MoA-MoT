    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax (`plx`) according to the relation:\n    N ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Parallax:**\n    Astronomical parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. For small angles, this relationship is given by:\n    plx = 1/r\n    This means that `r = 1/plx`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:**\n    We can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given equation for the number of stars.\n    Since `plx = 1/r`, we replace `plx` in the initial formula:\n    N ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)\n    N ∝ r⁵\n\n    This tells us that the total cumulative number of stars up to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is a rate of change, which mathematically corresponds to the derivative of the number of stars (`N`) with respect to the distance (`r`). We are looking for how `dN/dr` behaves.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We have the proportionality `N ∝ r⁵`. We can write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    N = k * r⁵\n\n    Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `r`:\n    dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹):\n    dN/dr = k * 5 * r⁽⁵⁻¹⁾\n    dN/dr = 5k * r⁴\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just a new constant, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`:\n    dN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r³\n    B) ~ r²\n    C) ~ r⁴\n    D) ~ r⁵\n\n    Our result `dN/dr ∝ r⁴` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
