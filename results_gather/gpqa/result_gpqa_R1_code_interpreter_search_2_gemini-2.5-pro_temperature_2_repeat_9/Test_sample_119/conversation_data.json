    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Key Quantities and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). This can be rewritten as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`, which is the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in a Shell of Space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (the Sun).\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`. The thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately the surface area of the sphere times the thickness of the shell:\n        `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`\n\n3.  **Express `dN` in terms of Parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Our equation for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`). We need to convert it to be in terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   **Step 3a: Substitute `d` with `plx`**.\n        Since `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute this into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * dd`\n    *   **Step 3b: Relate the differential `dd` to `d(plx)`**.\n        We start with the relationship `d = 1/plx`. We differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx^2`\n        Rearranging this gives us:\n        `dd = - (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n        The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are considering the number of stars within a certain range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx^2) * |d(plx)|`\n\n4.  **Combine the Expressions and Find the Final Relationship:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expression for `dd` from Step 3b into the equation for `dN` from Step 3a:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * [ (1/plx^2) * d(plx) ]`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / (plx^2 * plx^2)) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^4)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
