    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the products using two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetric about the double bond.\n    `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3` (trans)\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA adds an oxygen atom across the double bond in a *syn*-addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the product.\n    *   A *trans*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetrical, this process creates a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. A water molecule then attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond (an Sₙ2-like mechanism). This is an *anti*-attack. The overall process of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. There's a useful mnemonic for this: \"**T**rans **A**nti **M**eso\" (TAM). A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso product.\n    *   Let's confirm this: Starting with the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxides:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via *anti*-attack at C4 (inversion of stereocenter) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide via *anti*-attack at C4 yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule due to the symmetry of the propyl groups on C4 and C5. This molecule possesses stereocenters but is achiral overall because it has a center of inversion; it is a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetric.\n    `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3` (cis)\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   A *cis*-alkene undergoes *syn*-addition to form a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane (or (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** This is again an *anti*-attack by water on the protonated epoxide.\n\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The mnemonic for this is \"**C**is **A**nti **R**acemic\" (CAR). A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's confirm: Starting with the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane:\n        *   *Anti*-attack at C4 (which is R) causes inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   *Anti*-attack at C5 (which is S) causes inversion, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since C4 and C5 are chemically equivalent, the two attacks occur at equal rates, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call these enantiomers **E+** and **E-**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product Mixture on HPLC**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n*   **E+** ((4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n*   **E-** ((4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **E+** and **E-** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E+** and **E-**.\n\nNow, let's consider the HPLC separation.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates compounds based on properties like polarity, size, and shape, but not on chirality.\n    *   Diastereomers (like **M** vs. **E+**/**E-**) have different physical properties and are separable.\n    *   Enantiomers (like **E+** and **E-**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and are *not* separable. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the unresolved racemic pair (**E+** and **E-**).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC column:**\n    *   A chiral column contains a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Diastereomers are also separable on a chiral column.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for **M**, one for **E+**, and one for **E-**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard (achiral) HPLC column and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC column. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
