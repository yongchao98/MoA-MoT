    "This problem requires identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR). Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and, consequently, the formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic and Structural Information:**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group is indicated. An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl (C=O) bond and two oxygen atoms. This means the chemical formula must contain O2. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this.\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This almost certainly refers to a disubstituted benzene ring, which has a C6H4 core.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution, where the protons on opposite sides of the ring are equivalent. This accounts for **4 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The proton (let's call it H_a) in `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3` is adjacent to only H_b, so its signal is a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton H_b is adjacent to H_a (one proton) and the -CH3 group (three protons). It will be split into a doublet by H_a and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C3H5) accounts for **2 vinyl Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl group is the one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has **3 Hydrogens**.\n        *   There is a second methyl group somewhere else in the molecule, also with **3 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that rules out structures with ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit. The second methyl group must be isolated, for instance, attached directly to the ring (Ar-CH3), or to the ester oxygen (-O-CH3), or to the ester carbonyl (-C(=O)-CH3).\n\n**2. Assembling the Molecular Structure:**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n*   An ester group containing the second methyl group as the other substituent.\n\nThere are two primary possibilities for the structure that fit all the data:\n\n*   **Possibility 1:** The ester is a benzoate derivative. The substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). The structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n*   **Possibility 2:** The ester is a phenyl ester derivative. The substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and an acetoxy group (-OCOCH3). The structure is **4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Determining the Chemical Formula:**\n\nLet's determine the formula for both possibilities.\n\n*   **For methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate (C6H4(CHCHCH3)(COOCH3)):**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from -OCH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **For 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate (C6H4(CHCHCH3)(OCOCH3)):**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the acetoxy group: C=O and CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the acetoxy -CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nBoth plausible structures consistent with all the given spectroscopic data lead to the same chemical formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Matching with Options:**\n\nWe compare our deduced formula with the given choices:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nOur result, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Alternative check using Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n*   Benzene ring = 4 DBEs (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n*   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Total DBE for the structure = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nNow let's calculate the DBE for the options:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7\n*   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 6\n\nThis eliminates A and C. We are left with B and D. However, our direct proton count from the NMR data (4 aromatic + 2 vinyl + 2x3 methyl = 12 Hydrogens) confirms the formula must have H12, which eliminates B (H14).\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
