    "The user is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, Ca²⁺, in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is a reversible reaction. The complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (represented as Y⁴⁻ for simplicity, as the problem assumes ideal pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated).\n\n    The formation reaction is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\n2.  **Formation Constant (K_f):** The equilibrium for this reaction is described by the formation constant, K_f (also called the stability constant).\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n    We are given K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\n3.  **Dissociation Equilibrium:** To find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n4.  **ICE Table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We can set up an ICE table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n    | Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [CaY]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | Ca²⁺         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | Y⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substituting into the K_f Expression:** Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Simplifying Assumption:** Since K_f is a very large number, it means the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make a simplifying assumption that:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n7.  **Solving for x:** The equation now becomes:\n    5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺:\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n\n    Let's perform this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5.0e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We solve the equation K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2 for x\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value for x (the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions) is approximately 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x, which is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    D) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
