    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles:**\n    *   The solution is created by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves to give K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to give 2Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water molecules.\n    *   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This mixture is a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant equilibrium for the buffer:**\n    *   The buffer system involves the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        H2PO4⁻ (acid) ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻ (conjugate base)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Calculate the moles of each substance:\n        *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles.\n        *   Since KH2PO4 provides one H2PO4⁻ ion, Moles of H2PO4⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles.\n        *   Since Na2HPO4●2H2O provides one HPO4²⁻ ion, Moles of HPO4²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Calculate the molar concentrations:\n        *   [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n        *   [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer:**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka2:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations because the dissociation/association is small.\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Determine the equilibrium that produces orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻):**\n    *   Orthophosphate is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, where hydrogen phosphate (HPO4²⁻) acts as the acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n6.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4³⁻]:**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka3:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   We use the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (≈ 0.02809 M) and the calculated [H⁺] (≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M) from the buffer system.\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11x10⁻⁸)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants provided in the problem\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # in Liters (200.00 cm3 = 200.00 mL = 0.200 L)\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4*2H2O\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# We assume the initial concentrations are close to the equilibrium concentrations for the buffer.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate [PO4^3-] concentration using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n**Code Execution Output:**\n`6.24e-07`\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
