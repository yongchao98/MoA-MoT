    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the atoms.**\nThe chemical structure is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   Carbons (C):\n    *   (CH3)2C: 2 in the two CH3 groups + 1 central C = 3\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 in the chain + 1 in the CH3 group = 2\n    *   CH2: 1\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 in the two CH3 groups = 3\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Hydrogens (H):\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH(CH3): 1 on the chain + 3 in the CH3 group = 4\n    *   CH2: 2\n    *   CH: 1\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements in their standard states.**\nThe formation of one mole of the compound from its elements in their standard states can be represented as:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert these elements into individual gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s, graphite) -> 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)\n\n*   Enthalpy for atomizing Carbon: We are given the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. For 12 moles of carbon, this is:\n    12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy for atomizing Hydrogen: We are given the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. So, the enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms is half of this value.\n    ΔH_atom(H) = (1/2) * BE(H-H) = (1/2) * 100 kJ/mol = 50 kJ/mol.\n    For 22 moles of hydrogen atoms, this is:\n    22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of elements (ΣΔH_atom_elements):\n    ΣΔH_atom_elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\nFrom the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:\n*   **C-H bonds:** As calculated in Step 1, there are 22 H atoms, each bonded to a C atom, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by \"=\". So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   In (CH3)2C=, there are 2 C-C single bonds.\n    *   Between =CH- and -CH2-, there is 1 C-C single bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-, there is 1 C-C single bond.\n    *   In -CH(CH3)-, there is 1 C-C single bond to the methyl group.\n    *   Between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-, there is 1 C-C single bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH=, there is 1 C-C single bond.\n    *   In =C(CH3)2, there are 2 C-C single bonds.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy for the molecule.**\nThis is the enthalpy of atomization for the compound (ΔH_atom_compound), which is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n*   ΔH_atom_compound = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements and the energy released when these atoms form the molecule (which is the negative of the total bond energy).\nΔHf = ΣΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 6: Convert the units to match the options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options B and C are given in kJ/g. We need to convert our answer to these units by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔHf (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100      # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200 # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300 # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400      # kJ/mol\n\n# From molecular formula C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\n\n# 1. Calculate total enthalpy of atomization for the elements\n# Enthalpy of atomization for one H atom is half of the H-H bond energy\nenthalpy_atomization_H = bond_energy_HH / 2\ntotal_element_atomization_enthalpy = (num_C_atoms * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H_atoms * enthalpy_atomization_H)\n\n# 2. Calculate total bond energy for the compound (enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\ncompound_atomization_enthalpy = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                                (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                                (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double)\n\n# 3. Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = total_element_atomization_enthalpy - compound_atomization_enthalpy\n\n# 4. Calculate molar mass and convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C = 12.0\nmolar_mass_H = 1.0\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C_atoms * molar_mass_C) + (num_H_atoms * molar_mass_H)\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format\nprint(enthalpy_formation_gram)\n```\n>>>\n11.44578313253012\n<<<C>>>",
