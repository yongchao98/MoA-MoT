    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Reaction Product from the NMR Data.**\n\nThe product results from a rearrangement of Compound X (C11H12O), so the product will also have the formula C11H12O.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This indicates significant unsaturation, likely including a benzene ring (4 DBE) and other double bonds or rings (2 DBE).\n\n**Analysis of the ¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically in a ketone or aldehyde. The high value suggests a conjugated ketone.\n*   **δ 126.9 (2C, s) to 144.1 (1C, s):** This region contains 6 signals corresponding to 8 carbons, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring plus a C=C double bond.\n    *   The signals at **δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)**, each representing two equivalent carbons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s):** These are aliphatic carbon signals. A chemical shift of ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). A shift of ~28 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (a methyl ketone).\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shift difference indicates the two substituents have different electronic effects.\n*   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** This singlet integrating to 3 protons, in the aromatic methyl region, corresponds to the methyl group on the para-substituted ring. Combined with the aromatic proton signals, this confirms the presence of a **p-tolyl group**.\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** This is another 3-proton singlet. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl ketone (CH₃-C=O). The singlet nature means it is not adjacent to any protons.\n*   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region. They are coupled to each other, indicating a **-CH=CH-** group. The large difference in chemical shifts suggests an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) is attached to one end, and an electron-donating/aromatic group is at the other, creating a polarized double bond.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nThe fragments identified are:\n1.  A p-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`)\n2.  A methyl ketone group (`-C(=O)CH₃`)\n3.  A trans C=C double bond (`-CH=CH-`)\n\nConnecting these pieces gives only one possible structure: **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n*   Structure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n*   Formula check: C = (1+6) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11; H = (3+4) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12; O = 1. Formula is C11H12O. Correct.\n*   This structure, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is fully consistent with all ¹H and ¹³C NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X by Considering the Reaction.**\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of Compound X to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This means Compound X must be an isomer of the product with the formula C11H12O.\n\nThe key structural feature of the product is the **p-tolyl group**. Chemical reactions under these conditions (thermal, non-superacidic) do not typically cause methyl groups to migrate onto a phenyl ring from a side chain. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** \"Styryl\" implies a `phenyl-CH=CH-` group. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Also, the formula is C10H10O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. While the formula is C11H12O, the lack of a p-tolyl group makes it an unlikely precursor.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This also has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. While the formula is C11H12O, it's an unlikely precursor.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The substituent \"4-methylstyryl\" is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Formula check:** The p-methylstyryl group (`C₉H₉`) plus the oxirane fragment (`C₂H₃O`) gives a total formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O**.\n    *   **Structural feature:** This molecule contains the necessary **p-tolyl group**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince Compound X must be an isomer of the product and is the only option that contains the p-tolyl group that is present in the final product, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The reaction is an isomerization of a vinyloxirane to its corresponding α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
