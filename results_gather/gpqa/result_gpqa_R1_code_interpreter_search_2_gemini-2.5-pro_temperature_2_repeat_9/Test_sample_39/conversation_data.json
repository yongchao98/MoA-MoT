    "This is a common piece of jargon used in chemistry labs, particularly those that heavily rely on chromatography for purification and analysis.\n\n1.  **Analyze the phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" suggests a lack of separation in a process where separation is expected. In chemistry, this often refers to visualizing the results of a separation technique.\n\n2.  **Consider the context:** Synthetic organic chemists spend a great deal of time purifying their products from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents. The single most common technique for both monitoring reactions and purifying mixtures is **chromatography**, especially Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.\n\n3.  **How chromatography works:** In techniques like TLC and column chromatography, a mixture of compounds is separated based on its differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is very polar) and a mobile phase (an organic solvent or solvent mixture, the \"eluent\").\n    *   Non-polar compounds have little affinity for the polar stationary phase and are carried along quickly by the mobile phase.\n    *   Polar compounds have a strong affinity for the stationary phase and move more slowly.\n    *   The key principle of separation is the difference in **polarity** between the compounds in the mixture.\n\n4.  **Relating the phrase to the technique:**\n    *   On a **TLC plate**, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel the same distance up the plate, and their spots will merge or appear \"on top of each other.\" This is a direct visual representation of a failed separation.\n    *   In **column chromatography**, different compounds elute from the column at different times, and a chemist collects separate fractions. If two compounds have similar polarities, they will elute at the same time, co-contaminating the collected fractions. When these fractions are analyzed by TLC, the spots will be \"on top of each other.\" When analyzed by an automated system like HPLC or GC, the peaks on the resulting chromatogram will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n\n5.  **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) Non-covalent interactions are the *reason* for differences in polarity and boiling point, but this answer is too general. It doesn't describe the specific experimental observation.\n    *   B) Similar boiling points would be a problem for **distillation**. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is far more commonly associated with the visual output of chromatography.\n    *   C) Optical rotation is a property measured by a polarimeter. It's not a separation technique. Compounds with similar optical rotations don't interfere with each other's separation in a physical sense. Enantiomers, which have identical physical properties like polarity and boiling point, would indeed be \"on top of each other\" on a standard TLC plate, but the *reason* is their identical polarity, not their optical rotation.\n    *   D) **Similar polarities** are the direct cause for compounds to fail to separate during chromatography, the most common purification technique. This leads to the direct visual or analytical result of spots or peaks being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most accurate and specific interpretation of the chemist's complaint.\n\nTherefore, the second chemist is most likely referring to a failed chromatographic separation because the compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
