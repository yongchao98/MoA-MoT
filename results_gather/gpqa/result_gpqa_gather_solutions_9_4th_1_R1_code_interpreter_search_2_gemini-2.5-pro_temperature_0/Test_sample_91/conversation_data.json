An error here will invalidate the entire calculation.\n*   **Distinguishing Enthalpies:** It is essential not to confuse the final answer with intermediate calculations. The enthalpy of atomization of the *product* is **11200 kJ/mol**, which matches **Option C** and is a common distractor.\n*   **Attention to Units:** The final step of checking units is crucial. The calculated molar enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.

We must calculate the energy required to convert the reactants from their standard states into gaseous atoms (`12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, calculated by summing all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4.

This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Bond Counting:** The most common source of error in such problems is an incorrect count of the bonds, especially the C-C single bonds. Using the `(n-1)` rule for the carbon framework is a reliable method for acyclic molecules.\n*   **Distinguishing Enthalpies:** It is critical not to confuse the enthalpy of atomization of the product (11200 kJ/mol, Option D) with the final enthalpy of formation. This is a very common distractor.\n*   **Attention to Units:** The final step of checking and converting units is essential. The correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy (1900) is presented with incorrect units (kJ/g) in Option C, another common trick in multiple-choice questions.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the correct calculation leads to an enthalpy of formation of approximately 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, along with a list of careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n    *   The chemical structure is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Atom Count:** A careful count of the atoms reveals 12 Carbon (C) atoms and 22 Hydrogen (H) atoms.

The enthalpy of atomization of the *product* is 11200 kJ/mol (Option D), which is a common distractor.\n*   **Attention to Units:** The calculation first yields an answer in kJ/mol (1900).
