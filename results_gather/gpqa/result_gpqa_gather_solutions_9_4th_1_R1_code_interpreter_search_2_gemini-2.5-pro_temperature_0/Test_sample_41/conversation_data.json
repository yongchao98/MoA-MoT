This requires calculating the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which can be written as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Laws to Relate Period and Temperature:** To solve the problem directly, we can derive a single relationship between orbital period and equilibrium temperature.\n    *   From the temperature law (Step 2), we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Law (Step 3): `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final, crucial relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 (`T_eq1 / T_eq3`). We find this by multiplying the given ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we use the relationship from Step 4 to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n        `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ = (3.22)³`.\n        `P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately **33.4**.

This means we need to calculate the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The solution requires two key principles from astrophysics:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** This principle relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`). So, `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (`a`). The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance. So, `P² ∝ a³`, which means `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:** We can create a single formula that directly relates the orbital period to the equilibrium temperature.\n    *   From the temperature relationship, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios: `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`.\n    *   Then, cube this result to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and compare the final result to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and a specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation and serves as a distractor. The mass ratios are irrelevant for the simple form of Kepler's Law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options are designed to match intermediate steps in the calculation. For example, the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is ~3.2 (Option A), and the orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1` is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)²` which is ~10.4 (Option C). It is crucial to complete all steps to arrive at the final answer.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution is critically dependent on the correct application of the exponents in the physical laws (`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`), which combine to `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers are overwhelmingly consistent in their physical reasoning and numerical calculation, all arriving at the value of ~33.4.

This means we need to calculate the ratio `P3 / P1`.\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The solution requires two key principles from astrophysics:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** This principle relates a planet's temperature to its distance from its star. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`). So, `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (`a`). The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance. So, `P² ∝ a³`, which means `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:** We can create a single formula that directly relates the orbital period to the equilibrium temperature.\n    *   From the temperature relationship, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this into Kepler's Law: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of the temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given ratios: `(T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`.\n    *   Then, cube this result to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and compare the final result to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios of the planets and a specific albedo value (0.3). This information is not needed for the calculation and serves as a distractor. The mass ratios are irrelevant for the simple form of Kepler's Law, and the albedo value cancels out because it is the same for all three planets.\n*   **Distractor Options:** The incorrect options are designed to match intermediate steps in the calculation. For example, the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` is ~3.2 (Option A), and the orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1` is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)²` which is ~10.4 (Option C). It is crucial to complete all steps to arrive at the final answer.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The solution is critically dependent on the correct application of the exponents in the physical laws (`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` and `P ∝ a^(3/2)`), which combine to `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers are overwhelmingly consistent in their physical reasoning and numerical calculation, all arriving at the value of ~33.4.

For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   **Physical Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which can be rewritten as `P ∝ a^(3/2)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Physical Laws:** To solve the problem, we need a direct relationship between the orbital period (`P`) and the equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`).\n    *   From the temperature law in Step 2, we can express the orbital distance as `a ∝ 1/T_eq²`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `a` into Kepler's Third Law from Step 3: `P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)`.\n    *   Simplifying the exponents gives the final relationship: `P ∝ 1/T_eq³`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the periods is the inverse cube of the ratio of their temperatures: `P_j / P_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)³`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`, which is equal to `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)³`.\n    *   First, we must find the overall temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`.\n    *   Now, we cube this value to find the final period ratio:\n        `P3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately **33.4**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) ~ 4.4\n    *   B) ~ 33.4\n    *   C) ~ 3.2\n    *   D) ~ 10.4\n    The calculated value clearly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem deliberately includes information that is not needed for the calculation to test the understanding of the underlying physics. This includes:\n    *   **Mass Ratios and TTV Method:** The mass ratios and the mention of the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) discovery method are distractors. The calculation relies on the simplified form of Kepler's Third Law, which assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n    *   **Specific Albedo Value:** The specific albedo value of 0.3 is not required. The crucial information is that the albedo is *the same* for all three planets, which allows the albedo term to cancel out when using ratios.\n\n*   **Intermediate Calculations as Distractors:** The incorrect options are cleverly designed to match intermediate results of the calculation, which can trap someone who stops the calculation prematurely.\n    *   **Option C (~3.2)** corresponds to the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3`, which is the first step of the calculation.\n    *   **Option D (~10.4)** corresponds to the ratio of the orbital distances `a3 / a1`, which is `(T_eq1 / T_eq3)² ≈ (3.22)² ≈ 10.4`, another intermediate step.\n\n*   **Correct Application of Laws:** The solution is critically dependent on correctly combining the exponents from the two physical laws (`T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²` and `P ∝ a³ᐟ²`) to arrive at the final relationship `P ∝ T_eq⁻³`.\n\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result of approximately 33.4. The inconsistencies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are an artifact of being presented with shuffled option lists and should be disregarded in favor of the robustly confirmed numerical result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
