The correct formula, which all candidate answers identified, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: List of Careful Points\nAnalyzing the provided answers reveals several key points that are crucial for arriving at the correct solution reliably.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Formula Simplification for High-Symmetry Planes.** The general formula is complex and prone to calculation errors. The most robust and insightful approach, demonstrated by the best candidate answers, is to simplify the formula algebraically for the specific (111) plane *before* substituting numerical values. For `h=k=l=1`, the formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable method as it minimizes the number of terms and the potential for rounding errors.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculation Precision.** To avoid errors, it is best to use exact values for trigonometric functions throughout the calculation. Using the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`, instead of a rounded decimal like 0.866, prevents small but significant inaccuracies. The final numerical evaluation should be the very last step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Option Matching.** This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. There is a clear consensus that the numerical result is ~9.54 Angstrom.

Use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n3.  Solve for `d_111` by inverting the equation and taking the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n4.  Calculate the final numerical value. Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated interplanar distance, rounded to two decimal places, is **9.54 Angstrom**.

Perform the Calculation using the Most Robust Method\nThe most reliable method, as demonstrated by the most accurate candidate answers, is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before substituting numerical values. This minimizes the number of calculations and the potential for rounding errors.\n\n*   For the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n*   Therefore, `h² + k² + l² = 3` and `hk + kl + lh = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification (as detailed in several candidate answers, notably Answer 11) leads to a much simpler and more robust expression for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, which means `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nTo find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### 4.

For `h=k=l=1`, the formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    Using this simplified version is the most reliable method as it minimizes the number of terms and the potential for rounding errors.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculation Precision.** To avoid errors, it is best to use exact values for trigonometric functions throughout the calculation. Using the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`, instead of a rounded decimal like 0.866, prevents small but significant inaccuracies. The final numerical evaluation should be the very last step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Option Matching.** This was the most significant point of failure among the candidate answers. There is a clear consensus that the numerical result is ~9.54 Angstrom. However, the agents selected different lettered options (A, B, C, D), indicating they were likely working with shuffled lists of choices. The final, critical step is to match the calculated numerical value to the specific options provided in the original question.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\nFollowing the best practices identified above, we will use the simplified formula for the (111) plane.\n\n1.  Start with the simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n2.  Substitute the given values: `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`. Use the exact value for `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n3.  Solve for `d_111` by inverting the equation and taking the square root.\n    $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n    $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\n4.  Calculate the final numerical value. Using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n    $$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n    $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated interplanar distance, rounded to two decimal places, is **9.54 Angstrom**. We now compare this result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the insights from the candidate answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Given Information and Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the interplanar distance, `d`, for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (given as \"interatomic distance\")\n*   **Interaxial Angles `α`, `β`, `γ`:** All are 30°\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### Step 2: Select the Correct Formula\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is given by the following formula.\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### Step 3: Simplify and Calculate\nThe most reliable method, which minimizes the potential for calculation errors, is to first simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane before substituting numerical values.\n\nFor the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and performing algebraic and trigonometric simplification leads to a much simpler expression for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\nNow, we substitute the given values (`a = 10` Å and `α = 30°`) into this simplified formula. We will use the exact value for `cos(30°)`, which is `√3 / 2`.\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\nTo find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is **9.54 Angstrom**.\n\n### Careful Points\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, several critical points must be considered to arrive at the correct solution:\n*   **Formula Selection:** It is essential to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral crystal system. Using a formula for a different system (like cubic or tetragonal) would lead to a completely incorrect answer.\n*   **Formula Simplification:** For high-symmetry planes like (111), the general formula can often be simplified. Doing so, as shown in Step 3, is the most robust method as it significantly reduces the number of terms and the potential for rounding errors during calculation.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** When using the full formula, it is critical to maintain high precision for trigonometric values. Prematurely rounding values like `cos(30°)` can introduce small errors. Using exact values (`√3/2`) or a high-precision calculator is the best approach.\n*   **Option Matching:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that this is the most common point of failure. Nearly all agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be ~9.54 Å, but many selected the wrong lettered option. This was likely due to being presented with a shuffled list of options. It is crucial to match the final calculated value to the specific options provided in the question.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and accurately yields a value of approximately 9.54 Angstrom.
