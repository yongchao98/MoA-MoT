This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, paying close attention to stereochemistry and its effect on the 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure and the options provided, we can confidently assign the proton signals. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Crucial Point)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful consideration of stereochemical principles.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle stating that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene used here, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two bridgehead methyl groups, leading to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the more open face, is sterically much more favorable.\n*   Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structures and Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\nA NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor product. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and correcting their inconsistencies.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of stereoselectivity for this reaction. It states that the major product formed under kinetic control (the one that forms fastest) is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The question asks about a feature of the **major product**, so the analysis must focus on the structure of the ***endo*** **adduct**. While some candidate answers suggest that steric hindrance might reverse this selectivity, the Alder-endo rule is generally robust and should be considered the default unless there is overwhelming steric clash, which is not definitively the case here.\n\n### **3. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure and the options provided, the proton signals can be confidently assigned based on standard chemical shift principles:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is in a shielded, aliphatic environment and appears as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions (**Me_bridgehead**).\n\n### **4. Analysis of 3D Structure and NOESY Data (The Crucial Step)**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor product. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the *endo* position is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is in this position. This geometry places the protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**) in close spatial proximity to the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). A NOESY cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons.\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis combination of signals is described in option C. Many of the candidate answers reached this same chemical conclusion but failed to select the correct corresponding letter, indicating clerical errors. The chemical reasoning overwhelmingly points to one answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first break down the question into its core components:\n    *   **Reactants:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride (dienophile). The spectroscopic data (¹H: 7 ppm, ¹³C: 137, 165 ppm) points to maleic anhydride. The diene is explicitly named 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Products:** A major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   **Key Data:** A 2D NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the two NMR signals corresponding to this unique cross-peak in the major product.\n\n2.  **Assign the NMR Signals:** Before analyzing the structure, I assign the proton signals described in the options to the functional groups in the product. This is a standard step based on chemical shift theory.\n    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: These are the protons on the anhydride ring, highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. I'll call them `H_anhydride`.\n    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: These are the methyl groups attached to the double bond. I'll call them `Me_alkene`.\n    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. I'll call it `H_bridge`.\n    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: These are the methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. I'll call them `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major Product (The Critical Step):** This is the most important decision point.\n    *   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts the *endo* adduct as the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. Many of the candidate answers follow this rule blindly.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. An *endo* approach would force the maleic anhydride to approach from the same face as the methyl groups, leading to a significant steric clash.\n    *   The *exo* approach is sterically much more accessible and will have a lower energy transition state.\n    *   Therefore, I conclude that due to sterics, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a more nuanced and chemically accurate assessment than simply applying the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data:** A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The question asks for a peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n    *   **Major Product (*exo* adduct):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the `H_anhydride` protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, tucking them underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them very close to the `Me_alkene` protons. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected here.\n    *   **Minor Product (*endo* adduct):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are in the *exo* position, far from the `Me_alkene` protons. Instead, they are close to the `H_bridge` protons.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The unique spatial interaction in the major (*exo*) product is between the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) and the alkene methyl protons (`Me_alkene`).\n    *   I match these protons to their assigned signals: `H_anhydride` is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`, and `Me_alkene` is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   This combination corresponds directly to option C.\n\nThis step-by-step plan, which prioritizes the correct stereochemical outcome based on sterics and then accurately maps the resulting interaction to the given NMR signals, leads to the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* adduct to be the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene used here, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that will become the bridgehead methyls, leading to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, avoids this clash and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. Therefore, due to overwhelming steric factors, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n### **3. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are significantly deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond.

Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or weak) in the minor product. Based on our determination in Step 2, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7 bridge.

Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (originating from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions (originating from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Crucial Step)**\n\nThis is the most critical point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**.

Therefore, due to overwhelming steric effects, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **exo adduct**.\n*   **Major Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond.

Identification of the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The chemical shifts correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2.

They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon.

Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, is sterically much more favorable. In cases of such high steric hindrance, the *exo* pathway has a lower energy transition state and becomes the kinetically favored pathway.\n*   Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectrum**\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n*   **Major (*exo*) Product Structure:** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) into the *endo* position, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_alkene**). A strong NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_alkene is expected.\n*   **Minor (*endo*) Product Structure:** In the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring would be on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons would be in the *exo* position, far from the Me_alkene groups. Instead, they would be close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure and the options provided, we can confidently assign the proton signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\n\nThis is the most crucial point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Many of the candidate answers correctly state this rule.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that will become the bridgehead methyls, leading to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a known exception to the general endo rule.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n*   **Major Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) into the *endo* position, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### **5.

Determination of the Major Product: The Critical Step**\nThis is the most important point of analysis and where a common mistake can be made.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major, kinetically favored product in Diels-Alder reactions. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. Therefore, due to this overwhelming steric effect, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **3.

Based on our determination in Step 2, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond.

Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify these points.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of stereoselectivity in this reaction. It states that the major product formed under kinetic control (the product that forms faster) is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   While some candidate answers (4 and 10) correctly note that severe steric hindrance can override this rule, in the context of a typical problem, the application of the general rule is expected. Therefore, we will proceed with the standard assumption: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**.\n*   The question asks about a feature of the major product, so we must analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structure and Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThis is the most critical step. A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the *endo* position is on the same side as the C7 bridge. In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is in this position. This geometry places the protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**) in close spatial proximity to the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). A NOESY cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons.\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must therefore be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.

Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure and the chemical shifts provided in the options, we can confidently assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring, which we can label **H_anhydride**. They are significantly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. We can label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). We can label it **H_bridge**. It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. We can label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Crucial Point of Stereochemistry)**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This makes it the kinetically favored (faster-forming) product.\n*   **However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance.** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that will become the bridgehead methyls (C1 and C4). This approach leads to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the opposite and more open face, is sterically much more favorable. In cases of highly substituted dienes like this one, sterics dominate, and the **major product is the *exo* adduct**. The minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. We must therefore analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n*   **In the major (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_alkene is expected.\n*   **In the minor (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position, far from the Me_alkene groups. Instead, they would be close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can confidently assign the chemical shifts:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis and where a simple application of rules can be misleading.\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky, particularly at the C1 and C4 positions which are involved in the bond formation. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups. The *exo* approach, from the more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **exo adduct**.\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product (C13H16O3) is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H14).\n\n### **2. Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of stereoselectivity in this reaction. It states that the major product formed under kinetic control (i.e., at moderate temperatures) is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state, which lowers its activation energy, making it the faster-forming product. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The question asks about a feature of the **major product**, so the analysis must focus on the structure of the ***endo*** **adduct**.\n\n### **3. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals based on standard chemical shift principles:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **4. Analyze the 3D Structure and Interpret the NOESY Data**\n\nThis is the most critical step. A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the *endo* position is defined as being on the same side (*syn*) as the longest bridge, which is the C7 methylene bridge. In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on this same side. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

An *endo* approach would force the maleic anhydride to approach from the same face as the methyl groups, leading to a significant steric clash.\n    *   The *exo* approach is sterically much more accessible and will have a lower energy transition state.\n    *   Therefore, I conclude that due to sterics, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a more nuanced and chemically accurate assessment than simply applying the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data:** A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The question asks for a peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n    *   **Major Product (*exo* adduct):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the `H_anhydride` protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, tucking them underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them very close to the `Me_alkene` protons. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected here.\n    *   **Minor Product (*endo* adduct):** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The `H_anhydride` protons are in the *exo* position, far from the `Me_alkene` protons. Instead, they are close to the `H_bridge` protons.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The unique spatial interaction in the major (*exo*) product is between the anhydride protons (`H_anhydride`) and the alkene methyl protons (`Me_alkene`).\n    *   I match these protons to their assigned signals: `H_anhydride` is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`, and `Me_alkene` is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   This combination corresponds directly to option C.\n\nThis step-by-step plan, which prioritizes the correct stereochemical outcome based on sterics and then accurately maps the resulting interaction to the given NMR signals, leads to the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify these points.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of stereoselectivity in this reaction. It states that the major product formed under kinetic control (the product that forms faster) is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   While some candidate answers (4 and 10) correctly note that severe steric hindrance can override this rule, in the context of a typical problem, the application of the general rule is expected. Therefore, we will proceed with the standard assumption: **Major Product = *endo* adduct**.\n*   The question asks about a feature of the major product, so we must analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structure and Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThis is the most critical step. A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the *endo* position is on the same side as the C7 bridge. In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is in this position. This geometry places the protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**) in close spatial proximity to the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**). A NOESY cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons.\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must therefore be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure and the chemical shifts provided in the options, we can confidently assign the signals:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring, which we can label **H_anhydride**. They are significantly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. We can label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). We can label it **H_bridge**. It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. We can label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Crucial Point of Stereochemistry)**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. This makes it the kinetically favored (faster-forming) product.\n*   **However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance.** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that will become the bridgehead methyls (C1 and C4). This approach leads to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the opposite and more open face, is sterically much more favorable. In cases of highly substituted dienes like this one, sterics dominate, and the **major product is the *exo* adduct**. The minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. We must therefore analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n*   **In the major (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_alkene is expected.\n*   **In the minor (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position, far from the Me_alkene groups. Instead, they would be close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can confidently assign the chemical shifts:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis and where a simple application of rules can be misleading.\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky, particularly at the C1 and C4 positions which are involved in the bond formation. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups. The *exo* approach, from the more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **exo adduct**.\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1.

The molecular formula of the product (C13H16O3) is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H14).\n\n### **2. Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity)**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a fundamental principle of stereoselectivity in this reaction. It states that the major product formed under kinetic control (i.e., at moderate temperatures) is the ***endo*** **adduct**. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state, which lowers its activation energy, making it the faster-forming product. The ***exo*** **adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The question asks about a feature of the **major product**, so the analysis must focus on the structure of the ***endo*** **adduct**.\n\n### **3. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals based on standard chemical shift principles:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. They are on carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **4. Analyze the 3D Structure and Interpret the NOESY Data**\n\nThis is the most critical step. A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. We must therefore find a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, the *endo* position is defined as being on the same side (*syn*) as the longest bridge, which is the C7 methylene bridge. In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on this same side. This geometry brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close spatial proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are brought close to the **Me_alkene** protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and one of the bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride)\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge)\n\nThis description perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
