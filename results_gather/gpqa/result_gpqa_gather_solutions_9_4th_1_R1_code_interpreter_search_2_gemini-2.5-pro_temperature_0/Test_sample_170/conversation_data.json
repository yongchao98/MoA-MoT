Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield in the product mixture. The task simplifies to arranging the substances in order of increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThis is the most crucial step, as it separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group A (Low Para-Yield): Meta-Directors.** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group B (High Para-Yield): Ortho, Para-Directors.** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Careful Point 2: Broad Ordering**\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group A and end with the substances from Group B. The correct order will have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Group A)**\nFor these substances, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Deactivating Strength:** The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   **Order of Increasing Para-Yield:** Reversing the order of deactivating strength gives: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group B)**\nFor these substances, the order depends on the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The consensus reasoning among the agents, based on a common textbook principle, is that the ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to give a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   **Order of Increasing Para-Yield:** Combining these points gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Consensus vs. Nuance**\nWhile the agents unanimously agree that `1 < 5`, it's worth noting that experimental data for bromination can sometimes show the opposite (`5 < 1`). However, the question is likely intended to be solved using the general principle of sterics, which leads to `1 < 5`. Following this standard logic is the correct approach for this type of problem.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of Group A (meta-directors): `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of Group B (ortho, para-directors): `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we compare this to the options provided in the question.\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option D.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Final Verification**\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was unanimously correct in deriving the sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, many failed in the final step of matching this sequence to the correct lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the provided choices. The sound, consistent chemical logic points directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting material, the molecular weight of the ortho, meta, and para monobrominated products is identical. Therefore, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer. The problem is to order the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect (The Broad Sort)**\n\nThe most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the highest para-yields and will appear at the end of the final sequence.\n\nThis initial sort establishes that the final order must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (The Low-Yield Group)**\n\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is slightly more deactivating than the ester group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (The High-Yield Group)**\n\nWithin this group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. While it is a deactivating group overall, its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\n\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first establishing the correct chemical principles for determining the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction. I will analyze the provided candidate answers to find the consensus on the chemical reasoning, which is overwhelmingly correct despite errors in matching the result to the final option letter. Then, I will implement this established chemical logic in a Python script. The script will assign a relative score to each substance based on its directing effect and other properties, sort them according to this score, and then compare the resulting sequence to the given options to determine the correct answer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical principles:\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** The first step is to divide the six substances into two groups based on their substituent's directing effect. This is the most significant factor affecting the para-isomer yield.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are deactivating, electron-withdrawing groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product. This group includes: 4 (C₆H₅-NO₂), 6 (C₆H₅-COOH), and 2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅).\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product. This group includes: 1 (C₆H₅-CH₃), 5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅), and 3 (C₆H₅-Cl).\n    *   This means the final sequence must begin with {4, 6, 2} and end with {1, 5, 3}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** Within this low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃), so it blocks the ortho positions more effectively. This leads to a higher para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) than for toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic & Steric Effects:** The chloro group (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This results in a very high para-yield, greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene. The order is **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine for Final Order:** Combining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this logic to find the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_bromination_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the order of benzene derivatives based on increasing yield of the\n    para-isomer in electrophilic bromination, based on established chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Assign a relative score to each substance based on its expected para-yield.\n    # A higher score means a higher yield.

Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either a *meta-director* or an *ortho, para-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order must have the substances from Group 1 at the beginning (lowest yields) and the substances from Group 2 at the end (highest yields). The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) has a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles reveals a clear and consistent path to the solution. The task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of the products is constant for a given starting material, this is equivalent to ordering by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents by Directing Effect:** The most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product. This group includes:\n        *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product. This group includes:\n        *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directing Substances:** Within this low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is slightly more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances:** Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Groups for the Final Order:** By combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n    *   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n    *   The complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match with the Given Options:** The derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` is compared with the provided options:\n    *   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    *   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n    *   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option A. It is noteworthy that while all candidate answers correctly deduced the chemical sequence, several failed to match it to the correct letter, likely due to variations in the option lists they were presented with. However, the chemical reasoning is unanimous and points directly to this answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Core Question\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key initial point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para) is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield. The problem simplifies to arranging the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe most significant factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2. The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)\n\nWithin this low-yield group, the percentage of para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)\n\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Answer\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nMatching this sequence to the provided options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Establish the Core Principle**\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting substance is the same. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The problem is thus reduced to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThis is the most critical step, which creates a broad structure for the final answer. There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on this point.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances {4, 6, 2} and end with {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\n\nWithin the low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. All candidate answers agree on the following logic:\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\n\nWithin the high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution. The consensus reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   The complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match the Final Sequence to the Options and Identify Careful Points**\n\nThe final, chemically correct sequence derived from the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we must carefully match this to the provided options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was universally correct, many agents failed in this final step of correctly matching the derived sequence to the corresponding lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the choices after the chemical analysis is complete.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the ortho, meta, and para monobrominated products is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield. The problem is thus simplified to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\nThe most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2. The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer produced is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Order\nBy combining the two ordered groups, placing the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we compare this with the provided options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was almost unanimously correct in deriving this sequence, many failed in the final step of matching it to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task**: The goal is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A crucial initial point, correctly identified by all agents, is that for a given starting material, the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same.

A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces its electron-withdrawing power.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**: Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that increase the para-to-ortho product ratio.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance**: The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack.

This creates two distinct groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.

A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para and ortho isomers.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of ortho, para-directors, the order depends on the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating but strongly para-directing substituent.

A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the monobrominated products (ortho, meta, and para isomers) is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its **percentage yield**. The task simplifies to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe most significant factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. This allows us to separate the substances into two distinct groups with vastly different outcomes.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n    *   *Conclusion*: This group of substances {4, 6, 2} will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n    *   *Conclusion*: This group of substances {1, 5, 3} will have the highest para-yields and will appear at the end of the final sequence.\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final order must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)**\n\nWithin this low-yield group, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which results in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)**\n\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices in the question:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option D. It is worth noting that while the chemical reasoning across the candidate answers is almost unanimously correct in deriving this sequence, many failed to match it to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, the correct order can be determined.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange the six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most important factor is the directing effect of the substituent, which separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These are deactivating, electron-withdrawing groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nWithin this group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. As the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers for a given starting material is the same, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Primary Division - Directing Effects**\n\nThe most important factor is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups with vastly different outcomes for para-substitution.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position.

The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification definitively establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors**\n\nWithin Group 1, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nWithin Group 2, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n2.  Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Matching the Sequence to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to match this chemically correct sequence to the given options.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option D.

This means the \"weight fraction\" of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its \"percentage yield\" in the product mixture.

Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield in the product mixture. The task simplifies to arranging the substances in order of increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThis is the most crucial step, as it separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group A (Low Para-Yield): Meta-Directors.** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group B (High Para-Yield): Ortho, Para-Directors.** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n**Careful Point 2: Broad Ordering**\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group A and end with the substances from Group B. The correct order will have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Group A)**\nFor these substances, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Deactivating Strength:** The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   **Order of Increasing Para-Yield:** Reversing the order of deactivating strength gives: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group B)**\nFor these substances, the order depends on the factors that influence the ratio of para to ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The consensus reasoning among the agents, based on a common textbook principle, is that the ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) is expected to give a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   **Order of Increasing Para-Yield:** Combining these points gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Consensus vs. Nuance**\nWhile the agents unanimously agree that `1 < 5`, it's worth noting that experimental data for bromination can sometimes show the opposite (`5 < 1`). However, the question is likely intended to be solved using the general principle of sterics, which leads to `1 < 5`. Following this standard logic is the correct approach for this type of problem.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of Group A (meta-directors): `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of Group B (ortho, para-directors): `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\nThe derived sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we compare this to the options provided in the question.\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option D.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Final Verification**\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was unanimously correct in deriving the sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, many failed in the final step of matching this sequence to the correct lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the provided choices. The sound, consistent chemical logic points directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting material, the molecular weight of the ortho, meta, and para monobrominated products is identical. Therefore, the \"weight fraction of the yield\" is directly proportional to the \"percentage yield\" of the para-isomer. The problem is to order the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect (The Broad Sort)**\n\nThe most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n    *   *Conclusion*: These three substances will have the highest para-yields and will appear at the end of the final sequence.\n\nThis initial sort establishes that the final order must have the structure: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (The Low-Yield Group)**\n\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is slightly more deactivating than the ester group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (The High-Yield Group)**\n\nWithin this group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. While it is a deactivating group overall, its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Final Order with the Given Options**\n\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first establishing the correct chemical principles for determining the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction. I will analyze the provided candidate answers to find the consensus on the chemical reasoning, which is overwhelmingly correct despite errors in matching the result to the final option letter. Then, I will implement this established chemical logic in a Python script. The script will assign a relative score to each substance based on its directing effect and other properties, sort them according to this score, and then compare the resulting sequence to the given options to determine the correct answer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical principles:\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** The first step is to divide the six substances into two groups based on their substituent's directing effect. This is the most significant factor affecting the para-isomer yield.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are deactivating, electron-withdrawing groups that direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product. This group includes: 4 (C₆H₅-NO₂), 6 (C₆H₅-COOH), and 2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅).\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product. This group includes: 1 (C₆H₅-CH₃), 5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅), and 3 (C₆H₅-Cl).\n    *   This means the final sequence must begin with {4, 6, 2} and end with {1, 5, 3}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directors:** Within this low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower para-yield.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors:** Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃), so it blocks the ortho positions more effectively. This leads to a higher para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) than for toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic & Steric Effects:** The chloro group (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This results in a very high para-yield, greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene. The order is **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these gives the order for this group: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine for Final Order:** Combining the two ordered groups gives the final sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this logic to find the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_bromination_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the order of benzene derivatives based on increasing yield of the\n    para-isomer in electrophilic bromination, based on established chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Assign a relative score to each substance based on its expected para-yield.\n    # A higher score means a higher yield.

Since the molar mass of all monobromo isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The key factors determining the yield of the para-isomer are the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either a *meta-director* or an *ortho, para-director*. This separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low para-yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, para-directors (High para-yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial grouping tells us that the final order must have the substances from Group 1 at the beginning (lowest yields) and the substances from Group 2 at the end (highest yields). The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Group 1)**\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (-NO₂) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is more deactivating than the ester group (-COOC₂H₅) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Group 2)**\nFor these substances, the para-isomer is a major product. The yield depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) has a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is highly para-directing. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) is distance-dependent and deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high para-yield (typically ~87-90%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders for the Final Sequence**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final arrangement from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Given Options**\nComparing the derived sequence with the provided choices:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe correct sequence, **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles reveals a clear and consistent path to the solution. The task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of the products is constant for a given starting material, this is equivalent to ordering by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents by Directing Effect:** The most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups.\n    *   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product. This group includes:\n        *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product. This group includes:\n        *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directing Substances:** Within this low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is slightly more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating alkyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing effect.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances:** Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is experimentally known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Groups for the Final Order:** By combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n    *   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n    *   The complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match with the Given Options:** The derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` is compared with the provided options:\n    *   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    *   B) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n    *   D) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option A. It is noteworthy that while all candidate answers correctly deduced the chemical sequence, several failed to match it to the correct letter, likely due to variations in the option lists they were presented with. However, the chemical reasoning is unanimous and points directly to this answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Core Question\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key initial point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para) is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield. The problem simplifies to arranging the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\n\nThe most significant factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2. The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)\n\nWithin this low-yield group, the percentage of para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)\n\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Answer\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nMatching this sequence to the provided options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Establish the Core Principle**\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the molecular weight of all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) for a given starting substance is the same. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The problem is thus reduced to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThis is the most critical step, which creates a broad structure for the final answer. There is a complete consensus among all candidate answers on this point.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n\nThis establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances {4, 6, 2} and end with {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\n\nWithin the low-yield group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer. All candidate answers agree on the following logic:\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\n\nWithin the high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution. The consensus reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene. This gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Sequence**\n\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   The complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match the Final Sequence to the Options and Identify Careful Points**\n\nThe final, chemically correct sequence derived from the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we must carefully match this to the provided options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** perfectly matches option **D**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was universally correct, many agents failed in this final step of correctly matching the derived sequence to the corresponding lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final answer against the choices after the chemical analysis is complete.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the ortho, meta, and para monobrominated products is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its percentage yield. The problem is thus simplified to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect\nThe most significant factor determining the product distribution is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. This allows us to separate the compounds into two distinct groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2. The structure of the answer must be: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)\nWithin this low-yield group, the amount of para-isomer produced is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups, leading to the lowest para-yield.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its steric size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Groups and Determine the Final Order\nBy combining the two ordered groups, placing the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors, we arrive at the final sequence.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 6: Match the Final Order with the Given Options\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Now, we compare this with the provided options:\n\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option C. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning was almost unanimously correct in deriving this sequence, many failed in the final step of matching it to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task**: The goal is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. A crucial initial point, correctly identified by all agents, is that for a given starting material, the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para) is the same. Therefore, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The task simplifies to ordering the substances by increasing para-isomer yield.\n\n2.  **Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**: This is the most important step, as it separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different outcomes.\n    *   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group)**: These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n        *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n        *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n        *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group)**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n        *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n        *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n        *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n    *   This classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directing Substances {4, 6, 2}**: Within this low-yield group, the para-isomer yield is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`. The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. The carboxylic acid is more deactivating than the ester because the electron-donating ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces its electron-withdrawing power.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances {1, 5, 3}**: Within this high-yield group, the order depends on factors that increase the para-to-ortho product ratio.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance**: The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Electronic and Steric Effects**: The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Groups for the Final Order**: By concatenating the two ordered groups, we obtain the final sequence from the lowest to the highest para-isomer yield.\n    *   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n    *   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n    *   The complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n6.  **Match with the Provided Options**: The final step is to match the derived sequence with the options given in the question.\n    *   A) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n    *   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    *   C) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   D) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   There is a unanimous consensus in the reasoning of all candidate answers regarding the chemical principles and the final derived sequence (`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`).\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates arise from inconsistencies in the multiple-choice options they referenced, not from flawed chemical analysis.\n*   The analysis must strictly adhere to the options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe core task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of **increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer** formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction.

This creates two distinct groups with vastly different yields of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position.

A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para and ortho isomers.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\n\nWithin the group of ortho, para-directors, the order depends on the factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is a deactivating but strongly para-directing substituent.

A key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that for any given starting substance, the molecular weight of the monobrominated products (ortho, meta, and para isomers) is identical. Therefore, the weight fraction of the para-isomer is directly proportional to its **percentage yield**. The task simplifies to ordering the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe most significant factor determining the para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. This allows us to separate the substances into two distinct groups with vastly different outcomes.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield)**\n    These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is very low.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n    *   *Conclusion*: This group of substances {4, 6, 2} will have the lowest para-yields and will appear at the beginning of the final sequence.\n\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield)**\n    These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.

A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which results in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is one of the most powerful deactivating groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester group (`-COOC₂H₅`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing power.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2)**\n\nWithin this high-yield group, the order depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The primary factor is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we place the low-yield meta-directors before the high-yield ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\n\nComparing the derived sequence with the given choices in the question:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe chemically correct sequence, `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`, perfectly matches option D. It is worth noting that while the chemical reasoning across the candidate answers is almost unanimously correct in deriving this sequence, many failed to match it to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, the correct order can be determined.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange the six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Since the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers for a given starting material is the same, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most important factor is the directing effect of the substituent, which separates the compounds into two groups with vastly different para-isomer yields.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These are deactivating, electron-withdrawing groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)\n    *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para-Yield)**\nWithin this group, the para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para-Yield)**\nWithin this group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance (Comparing 1 and 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects (Comparing with 3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Provided Options**\nThe derived chemically correct sequence is `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. As the molecular weight of all monobrominated isomers for a given starting material is the same, this is equivalent to arranging them by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Primary Division - Directing Effects**\n\nThe most important factor is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups with vastly different outcomes for para-substitution.\n\n*   **Group 1: Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n*   **Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification definitively establishes that the final sequence must begin with the substances from Group 1 and end with the substances from Group 2.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Ordering the Meta-Directors**\n\nWithin Group 1, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   The nitro group (`-NO2`) is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) is more deactivating than the ester (`-COOC2H5`) because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing character.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nWithin Group 2, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, making the unhindered para position a more favorable site for attack. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more significantly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is known to be higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n2.  Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Matching the Sequence to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to match this chemically correct sequence to the given options.\n\n*   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n*   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n*   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n*   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` perfectly matches option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was consistently correct in deriving this sequence, many failed in this final step of matching it to the correct letter option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles, here is a step-by-step determination of the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Core Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. As correctly identified by all candidate answers, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para-isomer, since the molecular weight of the products (ortho, meta, para-brominated derivatives) is the same for any given starting substance.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **Step-by-Step Chemical Reasoning**\n\nThe solution relies on a logical sequence of chemical principles, which was unanimously agreed upon in the reasoning of all candidate answers.\n\n**Point 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe most significant factor determining para-isomer yield is the directing effect of the substituent. This allows for a clear separation of the substances into two groups.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield Group):** These are electron-withdrawing, deactivating groups that direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro group)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield Group):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions, making the para-isomer a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl group)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro group)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the final sequence must begin with the meta-directors {4, 6, 2} and end with the ortho, para-directors {1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Point 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\nWithin the low-yield group, the para-isomer yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Point 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\nWithin the high-yield group, the order depends on factors that favor para substitution over ortho substitution, primarily steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the unhindered para position more favorable. Consequently, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher para-yield than toluene (1). This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects:** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is strongly para-directing. Its powerful, distance-dependent inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with its size, results in a very high para-yield, which is experimentally known to be higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n*   Therefore, the complete order for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Point 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we arrive at the final sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe complete, combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is robust and consistently leads to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.
