    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and an analysis of the final products.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6) to Compound B:**\n    *   The molecular formula C3H6 can represent either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n    *   The reaction is bromination in CCl4 (Br2/CCl4), which is a classic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Propene readily undergoes electrophilic addition.\n    *   A (Propene) + Br2 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   **Compound A** is **Propene**.\n    *   **Compound B** is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n*   **Compound B to Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The strong base removes two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne.\n    *   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **Compound C** is **Propyne**.\n\n*   **Compound C to Compound D:**\n    *   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic polymerization (trimerization) reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   3 CH3-C≡CH → 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   **Compound D** is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n*   **Compound D to Compound E:**\n    *   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is characteristic of nitration (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   **Compound E** is **2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Compound E to Compound F:**\n    *   Compound E (a nitro-aromatic compound) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   **Compound F** is **2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine)**.\n\n*   **Compound F to Compound G:**\n    *   Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, generated in situ from NaNO2 + HCl) at low temperature (0-5 °C). This is the diazotization reaction.\n    *   Mesidine + HNO2 → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n    *   **Compound G** is **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Compound G to Compound H:**\n    *   Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide. This typically implies warming with water (hydrolysis) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n    *   2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O (hydrolysis) → 2,4,6-trimethylphenol\n    *   **Compound H** is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Statements**\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the identities of the compounds.\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a small alkyne, it is highly flammable.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine), a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are essential starting materials for producing azo dyes through diazotization and coupling reactions.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce another single signal. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons for either group, both signals are singlets.\n    *   This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect phenols, typically yielding a violet, green, or blue color. However, phenols with bulky substituent groups at both ortho-positions (the carbons adjacent to the -OH group) are sterically hindered. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with the ferric ion (Fe³⁺). Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a negative ferric chloride test. The solution would remain the yellow-brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself; it does not \"give\" or produce a yellow color as a result of a reaction.\n    *   This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
