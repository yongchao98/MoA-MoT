    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   `r`: distance to a star.\n    *   `plx`: parallax of a star.\n    *   The relationship between distance and parallax is `plx = 1/r` (assuming `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   The quantity \"number of stars per unit range of distance\" is the derivative `dN/dr`. This is what we need to find.\n    *   The given information is \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n2.  **Use the Chain Rule for Transformation:**\n    We want to find the relationship for `dN/dr`, but we are given the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    When counting stars, we are concerned with the magnitude of the interval change, so we use the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known relationships:**\n    Now substitute the proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the expression for `|d(plx)/dr|` back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n5.  **Express the final result in terms of `r`:**\n    The current expression is in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need to express it solely in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance as `r³`.\n\nTo verify this derivation, we can use a symbolic math library in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define r and plx as positive symbolic variables\nr, plx = sp.symbols('r plx', positive=True)\n\n# The given relationship is that the number of stars per unit parallax interval\n# (dN/d(plx)) is proportional to 1/plx^5.\ndN_dplx_prop = 1 / plx**5\n\n# The relationship between parallax and distance is plx = 1/r.\nplx_from_r = 1/r\n\n# We need the change of variables factor, which is the absolute value of the derivative |d(plx)/dr|.\ndplx_dr = sp.diff(plx_from_r, r)\nabs_dplx_dr = sp.Abs(dplx_dr)\n\n# The number of stars per unit distance interval (dN/dr) is found using the chain rule:\n# dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|\ndN_dr_prop = dN_dplx_prop * abs_dplx_dr\n\n# To get the final relationship in terms of r, substitute plx = 1/r into the expression.\nfinal_relation = dN_dr_prop.subs(plx, plx_from_r)\n\n# Simplify the final expression to see the proportionality.\nsimplified_relation = sp.simplify(final_relation)\n\nprint(\"The number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to:\")\nprint(simplified_relation)\n```\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to:\nr**3\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The number of stars per unit range of distance, denoted as dN/dr, describes how the density of stars changes as we look further into space. We are given the relationship for the number of stars in terms of parallax (plx) and need to convert it into a relationship in terms of distance (r).\n\n1.  **Given Information**: The number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means that the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, `d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality for the number density in parallax space:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Fundamental Relationship**: The distance `r` to a star (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of its parallax angle `plx` (in arcseconds):\n    `r = 1/plx`  or  `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **Transformation of Variables**: We want to find `dN/dr`. We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the rate of change with respect to distance to the rate of change with respect to parallax:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Derivative**: First, we need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`:\n    `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    When relating number counts, we are concerned with the magnitude of the change, so we take the absolute value:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Combine the Proportionalities**: Now, substitute the known relationships back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n6.  **Express in Terms of Distance (r)**: The final step is to replace the parallax `plx` with its equivalent in terms of distance `r` (`plx = 1/r`):\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
