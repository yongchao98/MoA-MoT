    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction Equilibrium**: The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca(EDTA)²⁻\n\n    The formation constant (also called the stability constant), Kf, is given as K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    Kf = [Ca(EDTA)²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n    We are starting with the complex, which will dissociate to some extent. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    Ca(EDTA)²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Dissociation Constant (Kd)**: The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, Kd, is the reciprocal of the formation constant, Kf.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n    The expression for Kd is:\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [Ca(EDTA)²⁻]\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the Ca(EDTA)²⁻ complex and assume negligible initial concentrations of the free ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms upon dissociation.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Ca(EDTA)²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Solving for x**: Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the Kd expression:\n    Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Since Kd is very small, the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺]:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n\n    To make the calculation easier, we can rewrite 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴) = √40 x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.32.\n\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    So, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n    This result matches option D. We can verify the calculation using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\n\n# Calculate the dissociation constant\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# We approximate initial_conc - x as initial_conc\n# K_d = x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 = K_d * initial_conc\n\n# Calculate x^2\nx_squared = K_d * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Calculate x, which is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, Ca-EDTA. We are given the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex and its formation constant (K_f). We need to find the concentration of the free metal ion (Ca²⁺) at equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Write the Relevant Chemical Reaction:** The complex is formed by the reaction between calcium ions and the EDTA ligand.\n    *   Formation reaction: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca(EDTA)²⁻\n    *   The problem starts with the complex, which will dissociate to a small extent. So, the relevant equilibrium is the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n        Ca(EDTA)²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Define the Equilibrium Constants:**\n    *   The formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5 x 10¹⁰.\n        K_f = [Ca(EDTA)²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant (K_d). It is the reciprocal of the formation constant.\n        K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   The expression for K_d is:\n        K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [Ca(EDTA)²⁻]\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n    *   Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every mole of Ca(EDTA)²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of EDTA⁴⁻ are formed.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| Ca(EDTA)²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *(Note: The phrase \"ideal pH\" implies that we don't need to worry about the protonation of the free EDTA⁴⁻ ligand. We can assume all non-complexed EDTA exists as EDTA⁴⁻, which simplifies the calculation significantly.)*\n\n5.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the K_d expression:\n    K_d = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:** The dissociation constant (K_d = 2 x 10⁻¹¹) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Now we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n        x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n        x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root of both sides to find x:\n        x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n        x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)  *(Rewriting to have an even exponent makes it easier to calculate)*\n        x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n        x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Verify the Approximation:** The value we found for x is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷, which is much, much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, our initial approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 was valid.\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is x, which is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe provided code output `6.32e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
