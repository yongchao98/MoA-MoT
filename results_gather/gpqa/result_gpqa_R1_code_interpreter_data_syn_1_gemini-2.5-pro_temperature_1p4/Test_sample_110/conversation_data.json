    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate (Michael Donor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The carbonyl group is at C1.\n        *   α-carbon at C2: It is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   α-carbon at C6: It is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form an enolate ion with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The enolate attacks the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated, typically during workup, to yield the final product.\n    *   The final structure has an ethyl propanoate side chain (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (Product A):**\n    *   The structure is 6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The options use a different IUPAC naming convention where the side chain is the parent and the ring is a substituent. Let's adopt this convention to match the options.\n        *   **Parent Chain:** ethyl propanoate. The ring is a substituent at position 3. The name will be `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n        *   **Substituent Name:** The ring is attached at its C6 position. In substituent nomenclature, this attachment point is numbered C1'. The numbering proceeds around the ring to give the other functional groups the lowest possible locants.\n            *   C1' is the point of attachment (original C6). It has a methyl group.\n            *   C2' is the original C1, which bears the oxo (=O) group.\n            *   C3' is the original C2, which has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   Combining these, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate (Michael Donor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   **Reagent (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane).\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion): CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group: CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation (Workup):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (Product B):**\n    *   We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon and name it as the parent alkane.\n        *   The nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group, so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n        *   The longest chain is: **C**N(1)-**C**H₂(2)-**C**H(CH₃)(3)-**C**H(NO₂)(4)-**C**H₂(5)-**C**H₃(6).\n        *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A methyl group at C3.\n        *   A nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = correct\n\nThe only option where both products are correctly identified is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
