    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem asks us to use the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2 * I), where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is initially in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest possible values for both quantum numbers, `v` and `J`.\n    *   Initial state: (v_i, J_i) = (0, 0).\n    The energy of this state is:\n    E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State:**\n    The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" A photon-induced transition must obey quantum mechanical selection rules. For a ro-vibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are:\n    *   Δv = v_f - v_i = +1 (for absorption from the ground state).\n    *   ΔJ = J_f - J_i = ±1.\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v_i = 0, J_i = 0):\n    *   Δv = +1  =>  v_f = 1.\n    *   Since J_i = 0, the rotational quantum number cannot decrease (J must be non-negative). Therefore, the only possibility is ΔJ = +1.\n    *   ΔJ = +1  =>  J_f = 1.\n\n    Thus, the final state that can be reached by absorbing a single photon is:\n    *   Final state: (v_f, J_f) = (1, 1).\n    The energy of this state is:\n    E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    ΔE = E_final - E_initial\n    ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Constants:**\n    To find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`. This requires calculating the reduced mass (`μ`) and the moment of inertia (`I`).\n\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n        Mx = 20 amu; My = 2 amu\n        μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 amu.\n        We convert this to kilograms: 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n        μ = (20/11) * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μ * R²\n        R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n        I = [(20/11) * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg] * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)².\n\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2 * I).\n\n6.  **Calculate Photon Momentum:**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) by the equation E = p * c, where `c` is the speed of light (2.99792 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n    p = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c.\n\n    Let's use a Python script to perform the numerical calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light (m/s)\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # amu to kg conversion factor\n\n# Given molecular properties\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR = 2.0e-10    # Bond length in meters\nomega = 4.0e14   # Angular frequency of vibration in rad/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate reduced mass (mu) in kg\nmu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu) * amu_to_kg\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B)\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the energy of the transition (delta_E)\n# delta_E = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0) = h_bar*omega + 2*B\ndelta_E = (h_bar * omega) + (2 * B)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the momentum of the photon (p)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"Reduced mass (mu): {mu:.4e} kg\")\nprint(f\"Moment of inertia (I): {I:.4e} kg*m^2\")\nprint(f\"Rotational constant (B): {B:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition Energy (delta_E): {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Photon momentum (p): {p:.4e} N*s\")\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the photon's momentum is approximately 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.

    "The problem asks for the momentum of a photon required to excite a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest possible energy state within the rotation-vibration model.\n\n**1.

Identify the Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state. This corresponds to the lowest possible values for both `v` and `J`. Thus, the initial state is (v_i, J_i) = (0, 0).\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω + B(0)(1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a photon-induced ro-vibrational transition, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Since the molecule starts at J_i = 0, the rotational quantum number cannot decrease (as J must be non-negative). Therefore, the only allowed change is ΔJ = +1.\n    *   This means the final state must be (v_f, J_f) = (1, 1).\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**3.

Calculate the Rotational Constant (B)**\nTo find ΔE, we first need to calculate `B`, which requires the moment of inertia `I`.\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    I = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nNow we can calculate ΔE:\nΔE = ħω + 2B\nΔE = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) + 2(4.604 × 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE = (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 × 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = pc, where c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.410 × 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\nThis value, 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s, is closest to option C.\n\nThe Python code execution confirms this calculation with a result of `p = 1.4101e-28 N*s`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
