    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n        *   Reactant: Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃).\n        *   Reactant: NaCN provides the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n        *   Product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin. The structure is CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n    2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n        *   This reaction is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion to a carbonyl group.\n        *   **Step 1:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n            CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        *   **Step 2:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a proton source.\n            CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n        *   Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (an acid) to complete the reaction. In an aqueous context, a generic strong acid source is represented by H₃O⁺. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would lead to a different reaction (bisulfite addition). Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:**\n        *   Reactant: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is an α-hydroxy nitrile. The key functional group undergoing transformation is the nitrile group (-C≡N).\n        *   Product: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid is an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n    2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n        *   The conversion of a nitrile (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   Nitrile hydrolysis is typically performed in the presence of water and is catalyzed by either a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH).\n        *   The problem specifies that reagent 'B' and water (H₂O) are used to effect this transformation.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Using a strong acid (like HCl) directly yields the carboxylic acid.\n            R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Using a strong base yields the carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), which would require a separate acidification step to form the final carboxylic acid.\n        *   Since the reaction shown produces the carboxylic acid directly in one step, an acid-catalyzed pathway is the most fitting description.\n        *   Comparing the options for B, HCl is a strong acid and a standard catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and would be much less effective for driving the hydrolysis to completion. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    *   For the first reaction, the required reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, the required reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
