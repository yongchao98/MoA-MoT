    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). The decay reaction is:\n    π⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\n2.  **State the Initial Conditions:**\n    The pion (π⁺) is stationary, which means it is at rest.\n    *   Initial momentum of the system (**p_initial**) = 0.\n    *   Initial energy of the system (E_initial) is the rest mass energy of the pion, E_initial = m_π * c².\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    This decay process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n        **p_initial** = **p_final**\n        0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\n        This means the momentum vectors of the muon (**p_μ**) and the neutrino (**p_ν**) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both particles: `p = |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**|`.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        E_initial = E_final\n        m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n        Here, E_μ and E_ν are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n        E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n        The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c².\n\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν):**\n        Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible for this type of problem. We will assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0).\n        E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0 * c²)² = (p*c)²\n        So, E_ν = p*c.\n        For a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: KE_ν = E_ν.\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We have the following system:\n    1.  m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    3.  E_ν = p*c\n\n    Substitute `E_ν` for `p*c` in equation (2):\n    E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n    From equation (1), we can express E_μ as E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν.\n    Now, substitute this into the equation above:\n    (m_π*c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n    Expand the left side:\n    (m_π*c²)² - 2 * (m_π*c²) * E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n    The E_ν² terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for E_ν:\n    (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2 * (m_π*c²) * E_ν\n    E_ν = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π*c² ]\n\n    This E_ν is the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν).\n\n    The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in the rest mass energies of the initial and final particles (the Q-value):\n    Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π*c²) - (m_μ*c² + m_ν*c²)\n    Since m_ν ≈ 0, Q = m_π*c² - m_μ*c².\n\n    Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is:\n    KE_μ = Q - KE_ν = (m_π*c² - m_μ*c²) - KE_ν.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    Let's use the given rest mass energies:\n    *   m_π*c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   m_μ*c² = 105.7 MeV\n\n    Now, I will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# KE_nu is equal to its total energy E_nu\nKE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is the remaining energy\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\n```text\nKinetic energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (ν).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). The reaction is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nWe are given the rest mass energies:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve for the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n**p_initial** = **p_final**\n0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n|**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy of the products after the decay.\nE_initial = E_final\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nWhere E_μ and E_ν are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n*   E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n*   E_ν = KE_ν (since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy)\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν² = (pc)² + 0, which means E_ν = pc.\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies**\nWe have a system of equations:\n1.  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  E_ν = pc\n\nFrom (1), we can write E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν.\nSubstitute E_ν for pc in equation (2): E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n\nNow substitute the expression for E_μ into this equation:\n(m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nExpand the left side:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nCancel the E_ν² term from both sides and solve for E_ν:\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)E_ν\nE_ν = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nThis E_ν is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν.\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the muon, KE_μ. The total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the reaction) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\nKE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²) - KE_ν\n\n**5. Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\nKE_ν = E_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nKE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nNow, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these values with the options provided:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
