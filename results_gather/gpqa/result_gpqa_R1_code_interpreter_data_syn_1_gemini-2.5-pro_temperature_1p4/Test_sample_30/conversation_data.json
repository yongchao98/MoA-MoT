    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to identify Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is an ortho-, para-directing activator for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product.\n    *   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n        ```\n           CH3\n            |\n           / \\\n         //   \\\\\n       --C-----C--\n         \\\\   //\n           \\ /\n            |\n           NO2\n        ```\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\n    *   Product 1, p-nitrotoluene, is reacted with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is an oxidation reaction.\n    *   These reagents can oxidize the benzylic methyl group. While this combination can sometimes oxidize a methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid, it is also known to perform a more selective oxidation to an aldehyde, especially on an electron-deficient ring.\n    *   To determine the correct product, we must consider the next step. If product 2 were p-nitrobenzoic acid, its reaction with acetone and NaOH (Step 3) is not straightforward. However, if product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde, it readily undergoes a well-known reaction with acetone and base. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n        ```\n           CHO\n            |\n           / \\\n         //   \\\\\n       --C-----C--\n         \\\\   //\n           \\ /\n            |\n           NO2\n        ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction (a type of crossed-aldol condensation). p-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and acts as the electrophile. Acetone (CH3COCH3) has acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   The base (NaOH) removes an α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n    *   The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product then dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   The reaction yields `p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`. The trans (E) isomer is the more stable and major product.\n    *   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.**\n        ```\n              O=N(+)-O(-)\n                  |\n                 / \\\n               //   \\\\\n             --C-----C--CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n               \\\\   //\n                 \\ /\n                  |\n        ```\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extended system of π-conjugation (benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize this conjugation, the molecule adopts a planar conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Since the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. Let's call this σ.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There are no rotational axes (for n > 1). A C2 axis cannot be found. For instance, a 180° rotation around an axis passing through the center of the benzene ring and along the C-C chain would not result in a superimposable image because a nitro group (-NO2) is on one side and an acetyl group (-COCH3) is on the other. There are no other C2 axes.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. For example, the methyl group does not have an equivalent group on the opposite side of any central point.\n*   **Conclusion on Point Group:**\n    *   The molecule possesses only two symmetry elements: the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   A molecule with only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C2h: requires a C2 axis and an inversion center. (Incorrect)\nB) Cs: requires a single plane of symmetry. (Correct)\nC) C3: requires a 3-fold axis of rotation. (Incorrect)\nD) D2h: requires three perpendicular C2 axes. (Incorrect)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
