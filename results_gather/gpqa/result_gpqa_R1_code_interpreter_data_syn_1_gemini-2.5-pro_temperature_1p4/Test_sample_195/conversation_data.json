    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a conservative force (Hooke's Law), so the total energy of the system is conserved. Since it's a \"relativistic\" oscillator, we must use the principles of special relativity for the kinetic and total energy of the mass.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of the system:** The total energy ($E_{sys}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and the potential energy ($U$) stored in the spring.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $v$ is its speed, and $c$ is the speed of light. This term includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring due to its displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is given by Hooke's Law, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at any point is:\n        $E_{sys} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the law of conservation of energy:** The total energy $E_{sys}$ remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant energy by evaluating it at a convenient point. The most convenient point is at the maximum amplitude, $x=A$.\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   So, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n        $E_{sys} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the energy at the point of maximum speed:** The speed of the mass is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when it passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$), where the potential energy is minimum ($U=0$).\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed is $v = v_{max}$, so the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{sys} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max:** Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $ \\gamma_{max} mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 $\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $ \\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} $\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} $\n    *   To isolate $v_{max}$, first invert both sides:\n        $ \\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} $\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $ 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} $\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $ \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} $\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $ v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}} $\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
