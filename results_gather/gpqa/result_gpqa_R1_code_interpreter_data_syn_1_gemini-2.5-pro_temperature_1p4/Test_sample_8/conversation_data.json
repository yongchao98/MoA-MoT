    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand C3h Symmetry\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n2.  A **σh (horizontal) mirror plane**: The molecule is indistinguishable after reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nA molecule belonging to the C3h point group must possess these elements, and no additional elements that would place it into a higher symmetry group (like D3h, which also has C2 axes perpendicular to C3). A molecule with D3h symmetry also contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, but its full point group is D3h. In multiple-choice questions, we typically look for the molecule whose highest-symmetry point group is the one asked.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule provided.\n\n*   **D) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cage-like molecule with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three ethyl (-CH2-CH2-) chains.\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes directly through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon. Rotating by 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis (a σh plane). Reflecting through such a plane would map the nitrogen end to the carbon end and vice-versa, which are different. The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** C3v. Since it lacks a σh plane, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n*   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic trianhydride)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings (-C(O)OC(O)-) are fused.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar (or very close to planar).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   In addition, it has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of these extra C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis elevates its symmetry.\n    *   **Point Group:** D3h. While it possesses C3 and σh elements, its complete point group is D3h, a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger, analogous molecule where the central core is triphenylene instead of benzene. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Like mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is large and planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and the molecular plane itself is a σh plane. It also has additional C2 and σv elements.\n    *   **Point Group:** D3h. Similar to molecule C, it has D3h symmetry, which is a higher symmetry than C3h.\n\n*   **B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Let's consider a symmetric conformation. We can place the B atom and the three O atoms in a plane. This plane will be our potential σh plane, and the C3 axis will be perpendicular to it through the B atom.\n    *   For the whole molecule to be C3h, the three isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] must be arranged appropriately. A conformation exists where:\n        1.  The three isopropyl groups have the same orientation relative to the B-O bonds (satisfying C3 rotation).\n        2.  For each isopropyl group, the methine C-H bond lies within the B(O)3 plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned one above and one below this plane.\n    *   In this conformation, reflection through the σh plane (the B(O)3 plane) swaps the top and bottom methyl groups on each isopropyl arm, leaving the molecule unchanged. A 120° rotation (C3) maps each isopropyl group onto the next identical one.\n    *   Crucially, this molecule does *not* possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is exactly C3h.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n*   Quinuclidine has **C3v** symmetry.\n*   Mellitic trianhydride (C) and its triphenylene analog (A) have **D3h** symmetry.\n*   Triisopropyl borate (B) has a stable, symmetric conformation with **C3h** symmetry.\n\nWhile molecules A and C do contain the C3 and σh symmetry elements, their full point group is D3h. Molecule B is the only option whose point group is precisely C3h. Therefore, it is the best answer to the question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
