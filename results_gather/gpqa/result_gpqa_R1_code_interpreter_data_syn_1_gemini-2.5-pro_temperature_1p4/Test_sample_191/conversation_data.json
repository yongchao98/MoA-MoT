    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and properties of conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$. Since the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, to make the total enclosed charge zero, a charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity wall.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We've established that a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of the opposite sign must appear somewhere else. This charge, which is $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   A key concept in electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**. The conducting material shields the outer surface from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q).\n    *   Therefore, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. It behaves as if it's the only charge present on an isolated spherical conductor.\n    *   For a spherical conductor, any net charge on it will distribute itself uniformly over its outer surface to minimize repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at the external point P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge $-q$ on the cavity wall is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    *   Thus, the only charge distribution that contributes to the electric field at point P is the uniform charge distribution of $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion and choice of answer:**\n    *   The result shows that the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. All other parameters, such as the cavity's radius $r$, its offset $s$, the distance $l$, and the angle $\\theta$, are irrelevant for calculating the external field. They are distractor variables.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula with the given options, we find that option B matches perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
