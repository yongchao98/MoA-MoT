    "This problem requires identifying the correct starting materials for two separate reactions that both produce α-diketones upon treatment with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H₂O).\n\n### Understanding the Reaction\n\nThe combination of NaNO₂, HCl, and H₂O is a classical method for the synthesis of α-dicarbonyl compounds (or 1,2-diketones) from ketones. The key aspects of this reaction are:\n1.  **Reagents**: Sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react in situ to form nitrous acid (HONO).\n2.  **Substrate**: The reaction works on ketones that have at least one α-hydrogen on a methylene (CH₂) or methine (CH) group. The reaction is most efficient with an α-methylene group.\n3.  **Transformation**: An α-methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O) is oxidized to a new carbonyl group. The overall transformation is:\n    R-C(=O)-CH₂-R'  ---(NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O)-->  R-C(=O)-C(=O)-R'\n4.  **Mechanism**: The reaction proceeds through several steps:\n    a.  Acid-catalyzed enolization of the ketone to form an enol.\n    b.  The enol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the nitrosonium ion (NO⁺), which is formed from HONO in the acidic solution.\n    c.  This forms an α-nitroso ketone.\n    d.  The α-nitroso ketone is in tautomeric equilibrium with its oxime isomer (-C(=NOH)-).\n    e.  Finally, the oxime is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to the corresponding carbonyl group, yielding the α-diketone.\n\nThis specific reaction pathway tells us that the starting materials must be ketones. Other functional groups like alcohols, diols, or ethers (as listed in some options) would not undergo this particular transformation to yield α-diketones.\n\n### Analyzing Reaction A\n\n*   **Product A**: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n*   This is a cyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   To form this product, the starting material must have been a ketone with a carbonyl group at either position 1 or 2, and a methylene group at the adjacent position.\n*   Let's consider **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. Its structure has a carbonyl group at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. Both are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n*   The reaction `NaNO₂/HCl/H₂O` will oxidize one of these α-methylene groups (e.g., at C2) into a carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction**: 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This is a correct transformation.\n*   Therefore, starting material A must be **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Analyzing Reaction B\n\n*   **Product B**: 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃. This is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at C2 and C3.\n*   The starting material must have been a ketone with a carbonyl group at either C2 or C3, and an adjacent methylene group.\n*   Let's consider **5-methylhexan-2-one**. Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₃. The carbonyl group is at C2. The α-carbons are C1 (a methyl group, CH₃) and C3 (a methylene group, CH₂).\n*   The reaction will preferentially oxidize the more reactive methylene group at C3 over the methyl group at C1.\n*   **Reaction**: 5-methylhexan-2-one → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is a correct transformation.\n*   Therefore, a plausible starting material for B is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we can evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one**\n    *   As determined above, both these ketones are the correct precursors for the respective diketone products under the given reaction conditions.\n\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol**\n    *   Neither starting material is a ketone. The given reagents do not convert an alcohol, ether, or diol into a diketone in this manner. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one**\n    *   Starting material A is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol**\n    *   Starting material B is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only option that provides the correct ketone starting materials for both reactions is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
