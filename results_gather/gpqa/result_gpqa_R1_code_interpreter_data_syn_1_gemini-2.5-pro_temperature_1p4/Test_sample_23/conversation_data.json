    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, assuming atomic masses H=1 and C=12.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y) = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n    *   `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n    *   `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 â‰ˆ 2`.\n    *   This indicates the empirical formula is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not decolorize bromine water, which means it is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z also does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is saturated.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds present in both mixtures (the two in X and the two in Y) must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also have a C6 ring skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One of its components is Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n).\n    *   Let the other component be Y2. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, Y2 must also be saturated or be an aromatic compound (which doesn't react with Br2 water without a catalyst).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z. If Y2 were another saturated cycloalkane, it would have to be Z itself. But the problem says Y is a mixture of \"two other liquids\" formed from X. Let's assume the components of Y are different.\n    *   Therefore, Y2 must be an aromatic compound whose carbon skeleton is the same as Z's and which hydrogenates to Z.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = { CnH2n (Z, a cycloalkane), Aromatic compound (Ar) }.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that decolorizes bromine water. This means they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in a \"disproportionation\" reaction, producing an equimolar mixture. A disproportionation reaction where a single substance reacts (e.g., `3A -> B + 2C`) does not produce an equimolar mixture. Therefore, the reaction must be an intermolecular hydrogen transfer between the two components of X: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. This type of reaction is often referred to as disproportionation in catalysis.\n    *   In this reaction, one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form the aromatic compound (Ar), and the other molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form the cycloalkane (Z).\n    *   So, the reaction is: `Cycloalkadiene + Cycloalkene -> Aromatic + Cycloalkane`. The diene is oxidized, and the alkene is reduced.\n\n5.  **Examine Possible Skeletons and Find the Solution**\n    We need to find a cycloalkane Z that is a common solvent and has a corresponding stable aromatic analogue. The simplest and most common cases involve a six-membered ring.\n\n    *   **Case 1: C6 Skeleton**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a very widely used solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}. Both are liquids, and the mixture doesn't decolorize Br2 water. This fits.\n        *   The reaction is `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogens in X1 and X2 must be `12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   Mixture X must consist of a cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's check the hydrogen sum: `10 + 8 = 18`. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The diene must be non-conjugated, which means it must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   So, X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. All conditions are met.\n        *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component: 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = **18**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: C7 Skeleton (Methylated C6 ring)**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Also a solvent.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Toluene (C7H8).\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}. This fits.\n        *   The total number of hydrogens in the reactants (X1, X2) must be `14 + 8 = 22`.\n        *   Mixture X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is `12 + 10 = 22`. This case also works. The total number of H atoms would be 22.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    Both the C6 and C7 cases are chemically plausible and lead to answers listed in the options (18 for C6, 22 for C7). In the absence of further information that could distinguish between these cases, we rely on the common practice in chemistry problems to assume the simplest, unsubstituted parent structure unless otherwise specified. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental parent system for this type of reaction.\n\n    Therefore, the most probable intended answer is the one derived from the C6 case.\n\n    The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
