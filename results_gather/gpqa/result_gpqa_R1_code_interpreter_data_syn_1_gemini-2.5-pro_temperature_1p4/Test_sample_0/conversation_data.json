    "This problem requires using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are related by the following inequality:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFor practical purposes and order-of-magnitude estimates, we can use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nHere, ΔE represents the natural line width or energy broadening of the state, and Δt is its lifetime (τ). The constant ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which has a value of approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the broader of the two energy widths.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state.**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nWe can use a Python script to perform these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (delta_E * delta_t ~ h_bar)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (Delta E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (Delta E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy difference must be larger than the widths, especially the larger one.\nprint(f\"The energy separation should be significantly greater than {max(delta_E1, delta_E2):.3e} eV to be resolvable.\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of State 1 (Delta E1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of State 2 (Delta E2): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe energy separation should be significantly greater than 6.582e-07 eV to be resolvable.\n```\n\n**Step 2: Apply the resolution criterion.**\n\nFrom the calculations, the energy widths are:\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nState 1 has a shorter lifetime and therefore a larger energy width (ΔE₁). To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the energy width of the broader level. So, the required energy difference must be greater than ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the given options.**\n\nWe are looking for an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is significantly larger than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than ΔE₁ and comparable to ΔE₂. The levels would overlap too much to be resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than both ΔE₁ and ΔE₂. Not resolvable.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is also much smaller than both ΔE₁ and ΔE₂. Not resolvable.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is much larger than both energy widths (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). An energy separation of this magnitude would ensure that the two energy peaks are well-separated and clearly distinguishable.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is a suitable value to clearly resolve the two states.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty (or width) of its energy level. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also called the energy width or natural linewidth).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582e-07 eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582e-08 eV.\n\n**2. Determine the condition for resolvability:**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. As a rule of thumb, the energy separation must be at least greater than the larger of the two widths.\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**3. Evaluate the given options:**\n\nWe compare each option with the required minimum separation of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is much larger than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ >> 10⁻⁷).\n\nAn energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is more than sufficient to ensure that the two energy levels are clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
