    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is our initial state, $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ since the electrons are in p-orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* measurements.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is given by $m_z \\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1.\n    *   The desired final state is one where the first electron has $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron has $m_2 = -1$. This corresponds to the uncoupled state ket $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. This is our final state, $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The connection between the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$) is given by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n    where $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Rule:**\n    A fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a statement of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   For our initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For our desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ when it starts in $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    This is equivalent to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$.\n\n    Let's check the conservation rule from step 3:\n    Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\n    Is $-1 = -1 + (-1)$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$? No, this is false.\n\n    Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This means it is impossible to find the system in a state where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ if it started in a state with a total $m=-1$.\n\nTo confirm this result programmatically, we can use a python script to check the condition for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\nl1 = 1  # Electron 1 is in a p-orbital\nl2 = 1  # Electron 2 is in a p-orbital\nl = 2   # Total orbital angular momentum quantum number\nm = -1  # Z-component of the total orbital angular momentum\n\n# Define the quantum numbers for the measured state.\n# We want the eigenvalue of L_1z to be -hbar, which means m1 = -1.\nm1 = -1\n# We want the eigenvalue of L_2z to be -hbar, which means m2 = -1.\nm2 = -1\n\n# The probability of this measurement is given by the square of the amplitude\n# of the final state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is\n# the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n# A fundamental rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to be non-zero is that\n# the z-components must add up: m = m1 + m2.\n# Let's check this condition.\n\nm_sum_of_components = m1 + m2\n\nprint(f\"Initial state total magnetic quantum number, m = {m}\")\nprint(f\"Measured state individual magnetic quantum numbers: m1 = {m1}, m2 = {m2}\")\nprint(f\"Sum of measured magnetic quantum numbers, m1 + m2 = {m_sum_of_components}\")\n\nif m == m_sum_of_components:\n    # This block would be executed if the measurement were possible.\n    # The actual value of the coefficient would be needed.\n    print(\"The condition m = m1 + m2 is met. The probability is non-zero.\")\n    # For completeness, let's imagine this was the case. The probability would be\n    # P = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2. We would need a CG calculator for this.\nelse:\n    # Since the condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    probability = 0\n    print(\"The condition m = m1 + m2 is NOT met.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the probability of this measurement is {probability}.\")\n\n```\n>>>\nInitial state total magnetic quantum number, m = -1\nMeasured state individual magnetic quantum numbers: m1 = -1, m2 = -1\nSum of measured magnetic quantum numbers, m1 + m2 = -2\nThe condition m = m1 + m2 is NOT met.\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement is 0.\n>>>\nThe reasoning and the code execution both confirm that the probability is 0. The measurement outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The total magnetic quantum number of the system must be conserved during the measurement process. Since the initial state has $m=-1$ and the final state has $m_1+m_2 = -2$, the transition is not possible.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons. We are given the initial state and the desired final measurement outcome.\n\n**1. Identify the Initial and Final Quantum States:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in a coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (p-orbital for electron 1)\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (p-orbital for electron 2)\n    *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $m = -1$ (z-component of the total orbital angular momentum)\n\n*   **Final State:** A measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is made. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_{z}$ operator is $m_z\\hbar$.\n    *   The desired outcome for the first electron is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome for the second electron is also an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the uncoupled state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**2. The Principle of Probability in Quantum Mechanics:**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$, to be in the final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two states:\n$P = |\\langle\\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial}\\rangle|^2$\n\nSubstituting our states, we get:\n$P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n**3. The Clebsch-Gordan Selection Rule:**\n\nA fundamental property of coupling angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. For a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the following condition must hold:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   From the final (measured) state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow we check the condition: Is $m = m_1 + m_2$?\nIs $-1 = -2$? No, this is false.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nPhysically, this means that it is impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be found in a state where the sum of its parts' z-components is $-2\\hbar$. This would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
