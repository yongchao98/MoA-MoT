    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it completely dissociates: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 2 * 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles\n\n**Step 2: Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Moles of H+ = 0.080 moles\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.180 moles\nThe H+ is the limiting reactant. All of it will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after neutralization = 0.180 moles - 0.080 moles = 0.100 moles\n\n**Step 3: React the excess strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nNow, the remaining 0.100 moles of strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles for this reaction:\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.100 moles\nThe CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. All of it will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 moles - 0.050 moles = 0.050 moles\n*   This means there are 0.050 moles of excess OH- in the final solution.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined by the concentration of these excess OH- ions. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   First, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   Next, calculate the final concentration of OH-:\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 moles / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # 0.050 mol\nmoles_h_strong = 0.400 * 0.2  # 0.080 mol\nmoles_oh_strong = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2 # 0.180 mol\n\n# Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_neut = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong # 0.180 - 0.080 = 0.100 mol\n\n# Neutralization of weak acid with remaining strong base\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_neut - moles_ch3cooh # 0.100 - 0.050 = 0.050 mol\n\n# Final volume\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # 1.200 L\n\n# Final OH- concentration\nconc_oh_final = moles_oh_excess / total_volume # 0.050 / 1.200\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh_final)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n12.62\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of each reactant before they are mixed.\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   As a strong acid, HCl completely dissociates in water: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   As a strong base, Ba(OH)₂ completely dissociates: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 = 0.180 moles\n\n**Step 2: Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H⁺ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH⁻ ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) first in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 moles\n*   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 moles\nSince there are more moles of OH⁻ than H⁺, the H⁺ is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Initial moles OH⁻ - Moles H⁺ reacted\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 moles - 0.080 moles = 0.100 moles\n\n**Step 3: React the excess strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nThe 0.100 moles of excess OH⁻ from the first neutralization will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n*   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH available = 0.050 moles\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 moles\nIn this reaction, the weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant as there are fewer moles of it.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.050 moles\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = Moles OH⁻ available - Moles OH⁻ consumed\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 moles - 0.050 moles = 0.050 moles\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻, a strong base. The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess strong base.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final OH⁻ concentration and pH.**\n\n*   First, find the total volume of the mixed solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   Next, calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 moles / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   Finally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # Weak acid\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2 # Strong acid\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2 # Strong base\n\n# Step 2: Neutralize strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_neut = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n\n# Step 3: React remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess_final = moles_oh_after_strong_neut - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final concentration and pH\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_oh_excess_final / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
