    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted (any integer value is allowed).\n\n2.  **Determine the Path of the Two Transitions:**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First Transition:** |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1, which means the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1, which means the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number n' is usually n-1 for the most probable decays, so n'=2 is the most likely intermediate step. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state is n'=2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2, 1, m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m_final - m' = 0 - m'. This is allowed if m' is 0 or ±1 (which it is).\n        *   This confirms that any of the three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩ via a dipole transition.\n\n3.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:**\n    Based on the selection rules, there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second transition (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is the only significant decay channel for the 2p state (its probability is essentially 1). We need to find the relative probabilities of the three possible first-step transitions.\n\n    The transition rate Γ for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator **r**: Γ ∝ |⟨final|**r**|initial⟩|².\n\n    The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since l=0). Because of this symmetry, the emission of the photon cannot have a preferred direction in space. The total radiation pattern, summed over all decay channels, must be isotropic.\n\n    *   The transition to |2,1,0⟩ (Δm = 0) corresponds to a π-transition.\n    *   The transitions to |2,1,±1⟩ (Δm = ±1) correspond to σ±-transitions.\n\n    For the total emission from a spherically symmetric state to be isotropic, the transition rates to each of the possible final `m'` states (which belong to the same `n', l'` manifold) must be equal.\n\n    Therefore, the rates for the three possible transitions are equal:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩)\n\n    The probability (or branching ratio) for any one of these transitions is its rate divided by the total rate. Since there are three equally probable channels, the probability for each is 1/3.\n\n    *   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n    *   Probability(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n\n    The probability of the entire cascade is dominated by this first step. So, the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's check the options against our findings.\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3.\n    *   D) >→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The route is valid (assuming typo correction), but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
