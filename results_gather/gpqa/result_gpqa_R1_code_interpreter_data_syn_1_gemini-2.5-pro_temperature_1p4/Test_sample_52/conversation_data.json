    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, having a core formula of C6H4.\n*   **FTIR:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group has the formula -COOR or -OCOR and contains one carbonyl group (C=O), contributing one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are chemically equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are also equivalent. This gives rise to two signals (typically two doublets), each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This is a classic splitting pattern for a 1-propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring (Ar-CH=) is split by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton (-CH=CH-CH3) is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (n+1=3+1=4, a quartet). The combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One CH3 signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-**CH3**). This signal would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The other CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates many potential structures. For instance, any substituent containing an ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2) group is ruled out.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the essential fragments of the molecule:\n*   **Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring:** A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Fragment 2: Hydrocarbon Substituent:** A 1-propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment's formula is C3H5. It accounts for two vinyl-H signals, one CH3 signal, and crucially, contains no -CH2- groups.\n*   **Fragment 3: Ester Substituent:** An ester group containing a methyl group but no methylene (-CH2-) groups. There are two possibilities:\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3 (formula C2H3O2)\n    *   An acetate group: -OCOCH3 (formula C2H3O2)\n    Both possibilities satisfy the FTIR data (ester), provide the second -CH3 signal, and contain no -CH2- groups.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n*   Ring (C6H4) + Propenyl group (C3H5) + Ester group (C2H3O2)\n*   Carbon atoms: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   Hydrogen atoms: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   Oxygen atoms: 2\n*   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe degree of unsaturation helps confirm the structure.\n*   DoU for C11H12O2 = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Let's count the unsaturation in our proposed structure:\n    *   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4\n    *   Propenyl group C=C double bond: 1\n    *   Ester C=O double bond: 1\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU for the formula matches the DoU of the proposed structure, confirming its validity.\n\n**5. Evaluate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This would not allow for the presence of both a benzene ring (DoU=4) and a propenyl group (C=C, DoU=1) and an ester (C=O, DoU=1). The required DoU is 6.\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. While the DoU matches, adding CH2 to the C11H12O2 structure would be required to get this formula. For example, changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would add CH2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, making this formula incompatible with the NMR data.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This requires an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another ring, double bond, or a triple bond) compared to our proposed structure, which is not suggested by the data and would be difficult to reconcile with the specified fragments.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information is C11H12O2.\n\nI will use a simple Python script to confirm the formula calculation from the fragments.\n```python\n# Define the atomic composition of each molecular fragment\naromatic_ring = {'C': 6, 'H': 4}\npropenyl_group = {'C': 3, 'H': 5}\nester_methyl_group = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}\n\n# Calculate the total number of each atom\ntotal_C = aromatic_ring['C'] + propenyl_group['C'] + ester_methyl_group['C']\ntotal_H = aromatic_ring['H'] + propenyl_group['H'] + ester_methyl_group['H']\ntotal_O = ester_methyl_group['O']\n\n# Print the resulting chemical formula\nprint(f\"C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\")\n```\nC11H12O2\n\nThe calculation confirms that combining the fragments derived from the spectral data results in the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for solving this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure Core:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core of our molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group.\" An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of the molecular formula options. It also contains a C=O double bond, which contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum in detail:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetric, specifically a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are equivalent, leading to two signals (often two doublets), each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This is a characteristic pattern for a 1-propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the ring. The proton on the carbon next to the aromatic ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets.\" This substituent fragment is -CH=CH-CH3, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group signal is from the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint. It means our ester group cannot contain an ethyl (-CH2CH3) or any other alkyl group with a -CH2- unit. Since the second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester, the simplest ester groups without a -CH2- group are the methyl ester (-COOCH3) or the acetate ester (-OCOCH3). Both of these ester fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent (containing a CH3 and no CH2): C2H3O2\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The python code confirmed this summation. The compound is likely methyl 4-(1-propenyl)benzoate or 4-(1-propenyl)phenyl acetate. Both fit all the data and have the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
