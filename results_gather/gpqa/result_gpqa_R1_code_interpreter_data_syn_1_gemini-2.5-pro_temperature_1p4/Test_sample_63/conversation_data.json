    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g. This corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information: **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states that CuO is formed. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the element that combines with the copper. The mass increase is 0.80 g.\n    *   This mass corresponds to the oxygen captured by the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms captured = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxygen could have come from gaseous O₂ (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). In both cases, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms are transferred to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C has passed through a water absorber, an acid-gas absorber, and hot copper without reacting. This indicates it is a very stable, non-acidic, non-oxidizing gas. Given that the products contain H and O, and the salts are common inorganic compounds, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the Salts A and B**\n\n*   The products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing species) tell us that the original salts must contain the elements **H, O, and N**.\n*   The fact that \"only a mixture of gases was formed\" with no solid residue suggests that the cation is not a metal ion (which would likely form a solid oxide). The most common non-metallic cation is **ammonium (NH₄⁺)**.\n*   Therefore, the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. The most common ones are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Propose and Test a Reaction Scheme**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of `n` moles of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and `n` moles of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's analyze their decomposition products.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** At ~200°C, the primary decomposition is: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's trace the products from `n` moles of each salt through the analysis tubes:\n*   **Heating:** `n` NH₄NO₂ + `n` NH₄NO₃ → `n` N₂ + `n` N₂O + (2`n`+2`n`) H₂O\n*   **Total gases produced:** `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and 4`n` mol H₂O.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the experimental data:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (H₂O):** Absorbs 4`n` moles of H₂O. We found this to be 0.20 mol.\n    *   4`n` = 0.20 mol  =>  **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The gases are N₂ and N₂O, neither of which is acidic. This matches the observation of no mass change.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Hot Cu):** The gases entering are `n` mol N₂ and `n` mol N₂O. N₂ is inert. N₂O reacts: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   This reaction transfers `n` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   We calculated that 0.05 mol of O atoms were captured.\n    *   `n` = 0.05 mol. This is consistent with the result from the water measurement.\n\n*   **Gas C (N₂):** The gas leaving tube №3 is the original `n` mol of N₂ plus the `n` mol of N₂ produced from the decomposition of N₂O.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = `n` + `n` = 2`n`.\n    *   With `n` = 0.05 mol, total N₂ = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This perfectly matches the measured 0.10 mol of Gas C.\n\n**4. Final Verification and Calculation**\n\nThe model is internally consistent. Let's verify the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mixture: 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B)** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# Moles of H2O from mass\nm_h2o = 3.60\nM_h2o = 18.015\nn_h2o = m_h2o / M_h2o\n\n# Moles of O captured by Cu from mass\nm_o = 0.80\nM_o = 15.999\nn_o_captured = m_o / M_o\n\n# Moles of final gas C from volume at STP\nV_c = 2.24\nV_molar_stp = 22.4\nn_c = V_c / V_molar_stp\n\n# From the reaction scheme:\n# n moles NH4NO2 -> n N2 + 2n H2O\n# n moles NH4NO3 -> n N2O + 2n H2O\n# Total products: n N2, n N2O, 4n H2O\n# Moles H2O = 4n => n = n_h2o / 4\n# Moles O captured from N2O = n => n = n_o_captured\n# Moles final N2 = n (original) + n (from N2O) = 2n => n = n_c / 2\n\n# We see that n should be around 0.05 mol from all three pieces of evidence.\nn = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses\nM_nh4no2 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*2 # N2H4O2\nM_nh4no3 = 14.007*2 + 1.008*4 + 15.999*3 # N2H4O3\n\n# Check initial mass\ncalculated_mass = n * M_nh4no2 + n * M_nh4no3\n# print(f\"Calculated mass: {calculated_mass:.2f} g\") # Should be ~7.20 g\n\n# The salts are confirmed as NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n# Calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 (N2H4O2)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 (N2H4O3)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n17\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Products**\n\nThe thermal decomposition of an unknown mixture of salts A and B yields a gas mixture. This gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through three tubes sequentially.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases such as CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases were formed** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. A common reaction at high temperatures is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Oxygen gas (O₂) also reacts (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). In either case, 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms are transferred to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an acid absorber, or hot copper. This suggests it is a very stable, non-acidic, non-oxidizing gas. Given the likely elements involved (N, H, O), this gas is almost certainly Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Elements Present:** The products are H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas that decomposes over copper (likely N₂O). Therefore, the original salts must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n*   **Cation:** The problem states that \"only a mixture of gases was formed,\" implying no solid residue (like a metal oxide). This points to a non-metallic cation, the most common of which is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   **Anions:** The anions must be oxyanions of nitrogen. The two most common are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   **Hypothesis:** The equimolar mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's assume the initial mixture contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nFor the equimolar mixture, the overall reaction is:\n`n` NH₄NO₂ + `n` NH₄NO₃ → `n` N₂(g) + `n` N₂O(g) + 4`n` H₂O(g)\n\nNow, let's check if this matches our experimental results by finding the value of `n`.\n*   **Water (H₂O):** Total moles of H₂O produced = 4`n`. We found this to be 0.20 mol.\n    *   4`n` = 0.20 mol  =>  **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   **Gas reacting with Copper (N₂O):** The gas that transfers oxygen to the copper is N₂O. Moles of N₂O produced = `n`. The reaction N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO transfers `n` moles of oxygen atoms. We found this to be 0.05 mol.\n    *   `n` = 0.05 mol. This is consistent.\n*   **Final Gas (N₂):** The final gas C is the sum of the N₂ produced directly and the N₂ produced from the N₂O decomposition.\n    *   Total Moles of N₂ = (`n` from NH₄NO₂) + (`n` from N₂O decomposition) = 2`n`.\n    *   We found the moles of Gas C to be 0.10 mol.\n    *   2`n` = 0.10 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol. This is also consistent.\n\nAll evidence points to `n = 0.05` mol for each salt.\n\n**4. Final Mass Verification**\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight given in the problem, confirming our identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B combined.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify the Products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The resulting gas mixture is analyzed by passing it through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases (e.g., CO₂, SO₂, NO₂). The fact that its weight did not change indicates that **no acidic gases were formed** during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's mass increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxygen-containing gas. Given the lack of acidic gases and the common decomposition products of nitrogen salts, nitrous oxide (N₂O) is the most likely candidate. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂, where 0.05 mol of N₂O would transfer 0.05 mol of O atoms to the copper.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to the reagents, making it very likely to be Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\n*   **Elements Present:** The products are H₂O, N₂, and N₂O. Therefore, the original salts must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n*   **Cation:** The decomposition produces \"only a mixture of gases,\" implying no solid residue. This strongly suggests a non-metallic cation, the most common of which is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   **Anions:** The anions must be oxygen-containing anions of nitrogen. The most common possibilities are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   **Hypothesis:** The equimolar mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**3. Verify the Hypothesis with Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's assume the initial mixture contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (~200°C):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nFor the equimolar mixture, the overall reaction is:\n`n` NH₄NO₂ + `n` NH₄NO₃ → `n` N₂(g) + `n` N₂O(g) + 4`n` H₂O(g)\n\nLet's check if our experimental data is consistent with a single value for `n`:\n*   **From Water (H₂O):** Total moles of H₂O produced = 4`n`. We found this to be 0.20 mol.\n    *   4`n` = 0.20 mol  =>  **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   **From Oxygen in N₂O:** `n` moles of N₂O are produced, which transfer `n` moles of O atoms to the copper. We found this to be 0.05 mol.\n    *   `n` = 0.05 mol. This is consistent.\n*   **From Final Gas (N₂):** The final gas C (N₂) comes from two sources: `n` moles produced directly from NH₄NO₂ and another `n` moles from the decomposition of N₂O over copper (N₂O → N₂ + [O]). Total moles of N₂ = `n` + `n` = 2`n`. We found the moles of Gas C to be 0.10 mol.\n    *   2`n` = 0.10 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol. This is also consistent.\n\nAll evidence points to `n = 0.05` mol for each salt.\n\n**4. Final Mass Verification**\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol) ≈ 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight given in the problem, confirming our identification of salts A and B.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B combined.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
