    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which is modeled by an exponential distribution. A key feature of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and the model.**\n    Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t (the survival probability) is given by the survival function S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    The probability that the atom *has* decayed by time t is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF), F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant.**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n    Using the CDF formula:\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    Solving for the survival part:\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n    This term, e^(-100λ), represents the probability that the atom survives for 100 minutes. We don't need to solve for λ itself; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n3.  **Formulate the question in terms of probability.**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    This is a conditional probability: P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50), which simplifies to P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n4.  **Apply the memoryless property of exponential decay.**\n    The memoryless property states that P(T ≤ t + t₀ | T > t₀) = P(T ≤ t). In simple terms, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes doesn't change its intrinsic decay probability for any future interval. The \"clock resets\" at the 50-minute mark.\n    Therefore, the probability of decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in *any* 150-minute interval.\n    So, we need to calculate P(T ≤ 150).\n\n5.  **Calculate the required probability.**\n    P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n    We can find e^(-150λ) using the relationship we found in step 2 (e^(-100λ) = 0.68).\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Substitute the known value:\n    e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n    Now, calculate the final probability:\n    P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to\n# finding the probability of decay for a new atom in a 150-minute interval,\n# which is P = 1 - e^(-150λ).\n# We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5.\n# So, P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\nprobability_of_decay = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(probability_of_decay)\n```\n> 실행 결과:\n> 0.4392946399086111\n\nThe calculation shows the probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    A) 44%\n    B) 40%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\n\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\"\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\n\nThe probability that an atom has *not* decayed by a certain time *t* is given by the survival function:\nS(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere:\n*   T is the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom.\n*   λ is the decay constant, a positive number that characterizes the decay rate.\n*   e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability that an atom *has* decayed by time *t* is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF):\nF(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant Relationship**\n\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\nUsing the formula for the CDF:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\nSolving for the survival part of the equation:\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\nThis equation gives us a way to work with the decay constant λ without needing to calculate its exact value.\n\n**3. Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nThis is a conditional probability: P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50), which simplifies to P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n**4. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nA crucial feature of exponential decay is the \"memoryless\" property. This property states that the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived. Mathematically:\nP(T ≤ t₀ + Δt | T > t₀) = P(T ≤ Δt)\nIn this problem, t₀ = 50 minutes and the future interval Δt = 150 minutes.\nTherefore, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a brand new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\nWe need to calculate P(T ≤ 150).\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to compute P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\nWe can find the value of e^(-150λ) using the relationship we found in step 2 (e^(-100λ) = 0.68).\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\nNow, substitute the value we know:\ne^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nThe probability of decay is:\nP(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we compute this value:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nProbability = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is equivalent to 43.93%.\n\n**6.
