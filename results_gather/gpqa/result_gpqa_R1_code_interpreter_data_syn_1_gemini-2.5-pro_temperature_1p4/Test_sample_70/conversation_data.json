    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the equilibrium temperature for each planet:\n    *   T_eq4 = T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))\n    *   T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    Now, let's create the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2:\n    (T_eq4 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   They orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same.\n    *   The problem states they have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`. This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term cancels out.\n    *   The factor of `2` in the square root is a constant and also cancels.\n\n    After cancellation, the formula simplifies to:\n    (T_eq4 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** We don't have the semi-major axes (`a`), but we do have the ratio of orbital periods (`T`). Kepler's Third Law connects these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star:\n    T² ∝ a³ or a³ ∝ T²\n    This means (a_2 / a_4)³ = (T_2 / T_4)²\n    Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_4):\n    a_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) from step 5 into the simplified temperature ratio from step 4:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Use the given period ratios T1 : T2 : T3 : T4 : T5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   The period for Planet_2 is `T_2 = 2` (in some arbitrary unit).\n    *   The period for Planet_4 is `T_4 = 3.5`.\n    *   The ratio T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\n    Now, plug this into the final equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nTo compute this value accurately, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The orbital period ratio for Planet_2 is 2 and for Planet_4 is 3.5.\nT2_over_T4_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is (T2/T4)^(1/3).\ntemperature_ratio = T2_over_T4_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.8298730999052044\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.8299, which rounds to 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\nGiven that the planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A_4 = A_2`), most terms cancel out:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n\n`P² ∝ a³`\n\nThis can be written as a ratio:\n`(a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²`\n\nSolving for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3))`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as `P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nTherefore, `P_2 = 2` and `P_4 = 3.5` (in relative units).\n\nPlugging these values into our final equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe calculation `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298` confirms the result.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `0.83`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
