    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($\\ell$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the fundamental formula:** The mean decay distance of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the product of its speed ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    $\\ell = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\n3.  **Relativistic effects:**\n    *   The particle's speed is $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of $c$.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is dilated with respect to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_{rest}$) due to relativistic effects. The relation is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_{rest}$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Combine the formulas:** Substituting these into the first equation, we get:\n    $\\ell = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_{rest}) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_{rest}$\n\n5.  **Express the terms using given quantities:**\n    *   **Proper lifetime ($\\tau_{rest}$):** The proper lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_{rest} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and $\\beta$:** These can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and mass ($m$). In particle physics, we use the rest energy $mc^2$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest energy: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$.\n        *   The momentum ($p$) is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can find the momentum term $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n        *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed in terms of momentum and mass. We know that the relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$. Therefore, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Assemble the final formula for calculation:** Substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{rest}$ and $\\gamma \\beta$ into the equation for $\\ell$:\n    $\\ell = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\\right) = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for $pc$:\n    $\\ell = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n7.  **Plug in the numerical values:**\n    *   Energy $E_X = 8$ GeV $= 8000$ MeV.\n    *   Mass (rest energy) $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV $= 1200$ MeV.\n    *   Width $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV.\n    *   The physical constant $\\hbar c$ is approximately $197.327$ MeV fm (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n8.  **Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV} = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay distance $\\ell$:\n        $\\ell = \\frac{7909.5 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n        $\\ell \\approx 6.59125 \\times 0.61665 \\text{ fm}$\n        $\\ell \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n9.  **Convert to standard units:**\n    Since 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m, the mean decay distance is:\n    $\\ell \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nThis result matches option C.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson X in the laboratory frame. The mean decay distance (or mean free path) is the average distance a particle travels before it decays.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** The mean decay distance, $\\ell$, for a particle traveling at a speed $v$ is given by:\n    $\\ell = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    where $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n3.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects:**\n    *   The particle is relativistic, so its lifetime is dilated in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_{rest}$), which is the lifetime in its own rest frame. The time dilation formula is:\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{rest}$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$.\n    *   The particle's speed is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n    Substituting these into the first equation, we get:\n    $\\ell = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_{rest}) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_{rest}$\n\n4.  **Relate Lifetime to Decay Width:**\n    The proper lifetime $\\tau_{rest}$ of a particle is related to its decay width $\\Gamma$ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). For particle decays, this relation is expressed as:\n    $\\tau_{rest} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n5.  **Express Kinematic Terms with Given Variables:**\n    The given quantities are total energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$).
