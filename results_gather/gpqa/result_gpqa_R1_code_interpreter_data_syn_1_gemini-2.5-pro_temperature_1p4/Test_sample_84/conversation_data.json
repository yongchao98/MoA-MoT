    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{*}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We can write the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 as:\n    $T_{eq,1} = T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq,2} = T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The star's temperature ($T_*$) and radius ($R_*$) are also constant. Thus, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The information about the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$) allows us to determine the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) caused by each planet.\n    The formula relating the Doppler shift to radial velocity is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude $K$.\n    $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Connect RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to the Semi-Major Axis (a):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination $i$ is very close to 90°, and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can make this assumption for both planets.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the formula for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G (M_p \\sin(i))^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G (M_{p2} \\sin(i_2))^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G (M_{p1} \\sin(i_1))^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n    Assuming $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$ and canceling the common terms ($G$, $M_*$, $\\sin(i)$), we get:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV semi-amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Now, plug these into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n    This can be calculated numerically.\n\nLet's use a python script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK1_over_K2_ratio = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the masses Mp2/Mp1.\nMp2_over_Mp1_ratio = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1_ratio = (Mp2_over_Mp1_ratio)**2 * (K1_over_K2_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is the square root of a2/a1.\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1_ratio)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nT_ratio=0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives a result of approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
