    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The \"hexan-3-one\" part tells us it's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone (C=O) at carbon 3.\n    *   The \"5-methoxy\" part indicates a methoxy group (-OCH3) on carbon 5.\n    *   The \"(S)\" designation indicates that the stereocenter at carbon 5 has the S configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3. This is a chiral molecule, and we start with a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH (an achiral reagent) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of two stereocenters (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material by an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso form.\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single, achiral molecule.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Mixture Analysis with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 5 different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow we analyze the separation of this mixture on the two types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable components:\n    *   Compounds **1** and **2** are diastereomers. They will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds **3** and **4** are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together. -> **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound **5** (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from their combined peak. -> **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (compounds 3, 4, 5), so they will be separated from them.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the separable components:\n    *   The mixture contains 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound **1** ((3R, 5S)-...)\n    *   Compound **2** ((3S, 5S)-...) - Diastereomer of 1, separated.\n    *   Compound **3** ((2R, 4R)-...)\n    *   Compound **4** ((2S, 4S)-...) - Enantiomer of 3, separated by the chiral column.\n    *   Compound **5** (meso) - Diastereomer of 3 and 4, separated.\n*   Assuming the column is effective, it will resolve all 5 distinct compounds.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
