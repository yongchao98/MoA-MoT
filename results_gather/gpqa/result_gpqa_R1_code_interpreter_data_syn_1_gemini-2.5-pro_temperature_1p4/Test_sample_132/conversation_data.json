    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n    *   H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a conjugate acid-base pair, creating a buffer solution. H2PO4- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the base.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n    *   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-       (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-      (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-      (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\n    The buffer in our solution is composed of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so its pH is determined by the second equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n3.  **Calculate the molar amounts and concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g (Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol)\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g (Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol)\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for Ka2:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    Rearranging to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We can use the initial concentrations calculated in step 3, as the change due to dissociation/association is negligible in a buffer.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    Using the equilibrium expression for Ka3:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    We can now substitute the [H+] value calculated in step 4 and the [HPO4^2-] concentration from step 3 to find the final answer.\n\nTo perform these calculations accurately, we will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given constants and values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0 # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_HPO4_2_minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4_2_minus = moles_HPO4_2_minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2_minus)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2_minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3_minus:.3e}\")\n```",
