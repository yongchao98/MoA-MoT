    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_j` in an excited state `j` to the number of atoms `N_i` in a lower energy state `i`:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E_j - E_i`).\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to each star:**\n    Let `R` be the ratio of the populations of the two energy levels, `R = N_j / N_i`.\n\n    *   For `star_1` with temperature `T_1`:\n        `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))`\n\n    *   For `star_2` with temperature `T_2`:\n        `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in `star_1` is twice that in `star_2`. This means:\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into the relationship from step 4:\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars (since it's the same atomic transition) and can be canceled from both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponents, take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to put `ln(2)` on one side:\n    `ΔE / (k_B * T_2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Factor and combine terms:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k_B`:\n    `(ΔE / k_B) * (1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n    `(ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k_B` is approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k_B`:\n    `ΔE / k_B ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    To be more precise, let's use a python script.\n    ```python\n    import scipy.constants\n\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23  # J\n    k_B = scipy.constants.k # J/K, Boltzmann constant\n\n    ratio = delta_E / k_B\n\n    print(f\"The value of the ratio ΔE / k_B is {ratio} K.\")\n    ```\n    \n11. **Finalize the equation:** Substituting the calculated value `ΔE / k_B ≈ 1` back into the equation from step 9:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n12. **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.**\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\n\nThe derived equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
