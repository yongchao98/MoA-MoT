    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE - Double Bond Equivalents):\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 DBE).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (R-NH₂). A primary amide (R-CONH₂) also shows two bands, but they are usually at slightly different frequencies. A secondary amine or amide would show only one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester like in option B (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃), as seen in an ester or ether.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets. One set is shifted downfield (8.0 ppm), indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl). The other set is shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like an amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can deduce the following structural fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃)\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O), which is part of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring\n\nCombining these fragments, the most logical structure is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂) on opposite sides of a benzene ring. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring. It fits all spectral data perfectly. The electron-donating -NH₂ group accounts for the upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm), and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group accounts for the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm). The IR and formula also match.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃), with the quartet for the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch in the IR would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). Also, the meta-substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The data shows two. Furthermore, it would have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR around 8.0-8.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that matches all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
