    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three protons, which is consistent with a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** This signal represents an acetate group (-OCOCH3). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this confirms a feature common to all of them.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signals in the Alkene (Vinyl) Region**\n\n*   We have two signals in the region typical for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. Each signal integrates to 1H, meaning there is one proton responsible for each signal. These are the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, which is typical for a vinyl proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=).\n*   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton. This neighbor must be the other vinyl proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (Â³J) across a double bond is stereospecific:\n    *   **Trans-coupling:** Typically 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis-coupling:** Typically 6-12 Hz.\n*   **Conclusion:** The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinyl protons are in a **trans** configuration. This eliminates the *cis* isomers (Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Analyze the Remaining Signals to Determine the Alkyl Chain**\n\nWe have now narrowed the options to Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's analyze the remaining signals to distinguish between a propenyl (CH3-CH=CH-) and a butenyl (CH3-CH2-CH=CH-) group.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is the other vinyl proton.\n    *   The multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The **doublet** part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The **quartet** part arises from coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons (n+1 rule, 3+1=4 lines), which means this vinyl proton is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   This signal represents a methyl group (3H).\n    *   Its multiplicity is a **doublet**, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms that this methyl group is adjacent to the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**5. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   An acetate group: `-O-CO-CH3` (from 2.1 ppm signal)\n    *   A `CH=CH` group with *trans* stereochemistry (from 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals and the J=16.0 Hz).\n    *   A methyl group attached to the double bond: `CH3-CH=` (from 1.6 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals).\n\n*   Putting these pieces together gives the structure for **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n    `CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH3(d)`\n\n*   Let's check if this structure is consistent with all data:\n    *   `H(d)`: 2.1 ppm, 3H, s -> **Match**\n    *   `H(a)`: 7.0 ppm, 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz -> **Match** (Coupled to H(b), trans geometry)\n    *   `H(b)`: 5.5 ppm, 1H, dq -> **Match** (Coupled to H(a) and the three H(c) protons)\n    *   `H(c)`: 1.6 ppm, 3H, d -> **Match** (Coupled to H(b))\n\n*   A **Trans-butenyl acetate** (`CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3`) would show signals for an ethyl group (a triplet and a multiplet/quartet), not a methyl doublet at 1.6 ppm. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) and the splitting patterns (dq for one vinyl proton and d for an allylic methyl), are uniquely consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
