    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences to determine the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nThe structure has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director. Introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group and an *ortho, para*-director. Introduced via bromination.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director. Introduced via nitration.\n\nThe key to multi-step synthesis is to introduce the substituents in the correct order to leverage their directing effects. A major challenge is that Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., rings with a -NO2 group). This means the acetyl group must be introduced before any strongly deactivating groups like nitro are present.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the -COCH3 group. This is a standard and effective reaction. The product is acetophenone.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director, so bromination will occur at the meta-position (C3). This step is regioselective and yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    In this case of conflicting directors, the reaction yields a mixture of isomers. However, nitration at C5 is often a significant product. Compared to other options, this route is plausible for forming the desired product, even if not in extremely high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in the option would modify this product and do not lead to the target, suggesting they might be extraneous or part of a flawed question, but the initial three steps represent a viable pathway.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene:** Standard bromination.\n2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer being major.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acylation:** This is the failing step. The benzene ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group (and also by the -Br group). Friedel-Crafts acylation does not proceed on strongly deactivated rings. Thus, this sequence is not suitable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.**\n3.  **Aniline + NaNO2/HCl → Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This step is a deamination that converts the diazonium salt back to benzene. Steps i-iv result in no net reaction (benzene → benzene), making this sequence nonsensical for the intended synthesis.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.**\n3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acylation:** This step is problematic. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring by forming an -NH2+-AlCl3 complex, preventing the desired Friedel-Crafts acylation on the ring. This sequence is not a high-yield route.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four options, sequence A is the most chemically sound. The first three steps provide a direct route to the target molecule. While the regioselectivity of the final nitration step (step iii) is not perfect, it is a plausible reaction. The other options (B, C, D) contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions (like Friedel-Crafts on a nitrated ring) or nonsensical (like regenerating the starting material). The extra steps in option A appear to be an error in the problem's formulation, but the initial sequence is the best among the choices.\n\nAn alternative, and arguably better, synthesis would be (1) Acylation, (2) Nitration to 3-nitroacetophenone, then (3) Bromination, where both -COCH3 and -NO2 direct the bromine to the C5 position. However, this sequence is not presented as an option. Given the choices, sequence A provides the most viable pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>"
