    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of axial chirality, as seen in some allenes and hindered biphenyls (atropisomers).\nA key test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) and a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are bulky nitro groups (-NO2) and methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho-substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 group at the other). Because the molecule is chiral, it can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It features a central carbonyl group bonded to two identical phenyl groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane containing the C=O group, the molecule possesses a C2 rotational axis along the C=O bond. Crucially, it also has a plane of symmetry that contains this C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans-configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond (E isomer). The formula is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, there is a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements (both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
