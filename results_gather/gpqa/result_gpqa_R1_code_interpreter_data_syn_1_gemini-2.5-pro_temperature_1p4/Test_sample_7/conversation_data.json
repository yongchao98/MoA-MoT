  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is my reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene from the single mutant data:**\n    *   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n    *   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of a functional G1 gene causes a 25% drop in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype.\n    *   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of a functional G2 gene completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 plays an essential, critical role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of a functional G3 gene causes a 50% drop in resistance, a more significant impact than G1.\n\n2.  **Analyze gene interactions using the double mutant data. This is key to understanding epistasis.** Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another gene mutation in a double mutant. The gene whose phenotype is expressed is called epistatic.\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. The phenotype of this double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` mutant (75% resistance). This means the `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. In a linear pathway, this implies G2 acts upstream of G1.\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, the phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is also epistatic to G3**. This implies G2 also acts upstream of G3.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the role of G2.** Since G2's knockout results in a total loss of resistance (a null phenotype) and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, the most logical conclusion is that G2 is an upstream master regulator that is required for the function of both G1 and G3. The problem statement explicitly suggests one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream; G2 fits this description perfectly. This conclusion allows us to eliminate option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n4.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.**\n    *   g1 mutant resistance: 75%\n    *   g3 mutant resistance: 50%\n    *   g1g3 double mutant resistance: 10%\n    *   First, let's check for epistasis between G1 and G3. The double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` phenotype (75%) and the `g3` phenotype (50%). Therefore, neither gene is classically epistatic to the other; they have a more complex interaction. This means the parts of the answers claiming \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" or \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" are, by this strict definition, incorrect. However, we must choose the best overall option.\n    *   Now let's examine the nature of their interaction. If G1 and G3 acted in completely separate, additive pathways, we would expect the resistance of the double mutant to be the baseline minus the individual losses: 100% - (loss from g1) - (loss from g3) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   The actual resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the 25% expected from a simple additive model. This type of interaction, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects, is called a synergistic interaction. Synergism often points to **gene redundancy**, where the two genes have overlapping or compensatory functions. When only one is knocked out, the other can partially pick up the slack. When both are knocked out, the system fails more dramatically than expected. Therefore, the statement \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a very strong interpretation of the data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    *   A) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits; we only have data on one trait, so this cannot be concluded). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect).\n    *   B) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" (Plausible if they are co-regulated by G2, but this is a specific molecular hypothesis that isn't directly proven by the data). \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Incorrect).\n    *   C) \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (Correct). \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (Correct, as evidenced by the synergistic interaction). \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Incorrect, based on classical definition).\n    *   D) \"G1 is a transcription factor\" (Incorrect).\n\n6.  **Conclusion.** Option C contains two conclusions (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") that are strongly and directly supported by the experimental data. Options A and B contain claims that are either unproven (pleiotropy) or less certain (same promoter). Although the third statement in option C about epistasis is incorrect by a strict definition, the first two statements are the most accurate and comprehensive description of the genetic relationships among the given choices. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, we select the option that is the \"best fit\" or \"most correct\". Option C is the best fit.\n\n<<<C>>>"
