    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State of Solar Neutrinos\n\nFirst, we need to know the primary sources of neutrinos from the Sun and their corresponding energy spectra. The Sun produces neutrinos through the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **pp-I Chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with energies up to 0.42 MeV. These are below the energy bands of interest (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).\n*   **pp-II Chain:** This branch produces mono-energetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). The vast majority (89.7%) are emitted at 861 keV, with a smaller line at 384 keV. The 861 keV line is the crucial component for this problem, as it falls squarely in the second energy band (800-900 keV). The total flux of `⁷Be` neutrinos is very high, around 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n*   **pp-III Chain:** This branch produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos. These have a continuous and broad energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. Therefore, `⁸B` neutrinos contribute to the flux in both energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).\n*   **CNO Cycle:** Produces neutrinos from `¹³N` decay (up to 1.20 MeV) and `¹⁵O` decay (up to 1.73 MeV), among others. Like `⁸B`, these have continuous spectra and contribute to both energy bands. However, their total flux is significantly lower than the `⁷Be` flux.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states: \"the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago\".\n\n*   **Time Delay:** The 8.5-minute delay is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun's core to Earth. This means we are observing the effects of this shutdown *right now*.\n*   **Consequence:** The pp-III branch is the source of `⁸B` neutrinos. If this branch stops, the production of `⁸B` ceases, and therefore the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos arriving at Earth drops to zero.\n*   **What Remains:** The problem explicitly states that \"all other reactions remained as they were\". This means the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle reactions continue as normal. Crucially, the **pp-II branch continues to produce the 861 keV `⁷Be` neutrinos**.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the Change\n\nWe now calculate the flux in the two specified energy bands given that `⁸B` neutrinos are absent.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The `⁸B` contribution, which was a major source in this band, is now zero.\n    *   The `⁷Be` line is at 861 keV, outside this band.\n    *   The only remaining sources are the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`).\n    *   Therefore, **Flux (band 1) = Flux from CNO**.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The `⁸B` contribution is zero.\n    *   The strong mono-energetic line from `⁷Be` neutrinos at **861 keV** falls directly within this band. This is a very large contribution.\n    *   There is also a smaller contribution from the CNO cycle neutrinos in this energy range.\n    *   Therefore, **Flux (band 2) = Flux from `⁷Be` + Flux from CNO**.\n\n### 4. Estimating the Ratio\n\nLet's compare the magnitudes of the fluxes.\n\n*   The total flux of the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV is very large, approximately **4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹**. This entire flux is concentrated in Band 2.\n*   The total flux from all CNO sources combined is about **5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹**. This flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). The fraction of this flux that falls into the 100 keV wide Band 1 (700-800 keV) is only a small portion of the total.\n*   We can make an order-of-magnitude estimate. The CNO flux in Band 1 will be roughly `(Total CNO Flux) * (Bandwidth / Spectrum Width)`. This gives a value on the order of `(5x10⁸) * (0.1 MeV / 1.7 MeV) ≈ 3 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹`.\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio:\n\n**Ratio = Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)**\n\nRatio ≈ (Flux from CNO in band 1) / (Flux from `⁷Be` in band 2 + Flux from CNO in band 2)\n\nRatio ≈ ( ~3 x 10⁷ ) / ( ~4.5 x 10⁹ + a small CNO term )\n\nThe `⁷Be` flux in the denominator is more than 100 times larger than the CNO flux in the numerator. The small CNO term in the denominator is negligible in comparison to the `⁷Be` flux.\n\nRatio ≈ (3 x 10⁷) / (4.5 x 10⁹) = (3 / 4.5) x 10⁻² = 0.67 x 10⁻²\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01 (or 10⁻²).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes very small (only CNO contributions), while the flux in the 800-900 keV band remains extremely high due to the dominant `⁷Be` line at 861 keV. The ratio of the small flux to the very large flux is therefore a very small number, on the order of 10⁻².\n\nThe closest answer is **B) 0.01 (10⁻²)**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
