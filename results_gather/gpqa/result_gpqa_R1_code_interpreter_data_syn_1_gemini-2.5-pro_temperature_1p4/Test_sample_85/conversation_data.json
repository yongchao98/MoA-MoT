    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe problem describes two reactions that start with related compounds (A and B) and, through different reduction pathways, yield enantiomeric products. The product is a lactone (cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**1.  Understanding the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group. It has one chiral center at carbon-4, where the ethyl group is attached. The two reactions produce the two different enantiomers, (R) and (S).\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with an oxygen atom (position 1), a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The reactions do not create this chiral center; it must already be present in the starting material.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided for starting materials A and B are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's break down this molecule:\n    *   It is a five-carbon chain (pentanoic acid derivative).\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n    *   It has an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)-O-isobutyl) at the other end (C5).\n    *   It has an ethyl group at C3. This C3 is a chiral center.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n\nThe key insight is that the chiral center in the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4) after cyclization. The reactions described (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (the two ends of the chain) and do not affect the stereochemistry at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material will be directly transferred to the product.\n*   An (R)-starting material will yield an (R)-product.\n*   An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n\n**2.  Analyzing Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu  ---(LiBH₄)-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  In the presence of acid (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group in an intramolecular reaction (esterification) to form a stable six-membered ring, the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As this reaction pathway does not alter the chiral center at C3, the configuration is retained. Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have been **(R)****-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**3.  Analyzing Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group is left unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu  ---(BH₃)-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is a hydroxy ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    3.  In the presence of acid (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl in an intramolecular reaction (transesterification), displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, this reaction pathway does not alter the chiral center at C3, so the configuration is retained. Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have been **(S)****-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
