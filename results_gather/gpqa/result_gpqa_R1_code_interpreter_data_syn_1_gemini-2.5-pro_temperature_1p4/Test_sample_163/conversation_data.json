    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This is expressed as the factor M1/M2.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Determine the Relevant Physics Principles:** The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The key relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of orbital velocity. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) can be expressed in terms of the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\n4.  **Derive the Formula:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states: `G * M_total * P^2 = 4 * π^2 * a^3`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit.\n    *   For circular orbits, the orbital speeds `v1` and `v2` are related to the semi-major axes of their individual orbits (`a1`, `a2`) by `v1 = 2πa1/P` and `v2 = 2πa2/P`. The semi-major axis of the relative orbit is `a = a1 + a2`.\n    *   This leads to `a = (P / 2π) * (v1 + v2)`.\n    *   The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This implies that the inclination of the orbit `i` is approximately 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`. Therefore, the observed radial velocity amplitudes (`K1`, `K2`) are equal to the orbital speeds (`v1`, `v2`).\n    *   Substituting `v1 = K1` and `v2 = K2` into the equation for `a`: `a = (P / 2π) * (K1 + K2)`.\n    *   Now substitute this expression for `a` back into Kepler's Law:\n        `G * M_total * P^2 = 4 * π^2 * [(P / 2π) * (K1 + K2)]^3`\n        `G * M_total * P^2 = 4 * π^2 * [P^3 * (K1 + K2)^3 / (8 * π^3)]`\n        `G * M_total * P^2 = (1/2) * P^3 * (K1 + K2)^3`\n    *   Solving for the total mass `M_total`:\n        `M_total = (1 / (2G)) * P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n    *   This shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes: `M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:**\n    *   Using the proportionality, we can write the ratio of the masses of the two systems as:\n        `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n        *   Sum for System 1: `K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n        *   Sum for System 2: `K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n    *   Now, substitute all the values into the ratio formula. The units (years and km/s) will cancel out, leaving a dimensionless factor.\n        `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]`\n    *   This calculation can be done using a simple script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 is given by (P1 * (K_sum1)^3) / (P2 * (K_sum2)^3)\nratio = (P1 * (K_sum1)**3) / (P2 * (K_sum2)**3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The result of the calculation is 0.432. Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 1.2\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated factor of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, assuming the orbits are circular and viewed edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for an eclipsing binary), the total mass M of the system can be related to the orbital period P and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\nM₁ + M₂ = P * (v₁ + v₂ )³ / (2 * π * G)\n\nSince the system is eclipsing, we assume sin(i) ≈ 1, so the measured radial velocity amplitudes (K₁, K₂) are approximately equal to the orbital velocities (v₁, v₂). Therefore, the total mass M is proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWe can use this proportionality to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period P₁ = 2 years\n*   Velocity amplitudes K₁ₐ = 10 km/s and K₁ᵦ = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes K₁_sum = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period P₂ = 1 year\n*   Velocity amplitudes K₂ₐ = 15 km/s and K₂ᵦ = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes K₂_sum = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we set up the ratio:\n(M_sys1) / (M_sys2) = [P₁ * (K₁_sum)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_sum)³]\n(M_sys1) / (M_sys2) = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n(M_sys1) / (M_sys2) = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\n(M_sys1) / (M_sys2) = 6750 / 15625\n(M_sys1) / (M_sys2) = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
