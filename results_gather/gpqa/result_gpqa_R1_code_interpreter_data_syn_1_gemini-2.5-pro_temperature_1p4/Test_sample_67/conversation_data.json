    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor. The basis states are typically chosen as the eigenstates of the `S_z` operator, the spin projection along the z-axis.\n*   `|+z>` (spin-up): `S_z |+z> = +(ħ/2) |+z>`\n*   `|-z>` (spin-down): `S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>`\n\nThe problem states that initially, the particle's magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) is `H = -μ · B = -γB S_z`. The energy is minimized when `S_z` is maximized, meaning the particle is in the spin-up state.\nTherefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is:\n`|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian for t > 0\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is:\n`H = -μ · B_new = -γ (S · (B j_hat)) = -γB S_y`\nwhere `S_y` is the operator for the y-component of the spin.\n\n### 3. Determine the Time Evolution of the State\nThe state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n\nTo calculate this, it is easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`. Since `H` is proportional to `S_y`, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of `S_y`.\nThe eigenvectors of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively. The corresponding eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` are:\n*   `E_+y = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` (for state `|+y>`)\n*   `E_-y = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` (for state `|-y>`)\n\nNext, we express the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` in terms of the `S_y` eigenvectors. The relationship between the z-basis and y-basis eigenvectors is:\n`|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\nNow we can apply the time evolution operator:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iHt/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iHt/ħ)|-y> ]`\n\nSince `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates, the operation is simple:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_+y t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-y t/ħ)|-y> ]`\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`. Let's first calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nTo do this easily, we can convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `z`-basis. Using `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`, we substitute them into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ exp(iγBt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n`|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n\nUsing Euler's formulas, `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`, this simplifies to:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\nNow we can calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n`<S_z(t)> = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nApplying `S_z` to the ket:\n`S_z [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>] = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nNow, taking the inner product:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] [cos(γBt/2)|+z> + sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\nDue to the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(2 * (γBt/2))`\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is then:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for the average z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\nIn our result, `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2) cos(γBt)`, the argument of the cosine function is `γBt`.\nTherefore, the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω` is:\n`Ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment vector precesses about the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `Ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
