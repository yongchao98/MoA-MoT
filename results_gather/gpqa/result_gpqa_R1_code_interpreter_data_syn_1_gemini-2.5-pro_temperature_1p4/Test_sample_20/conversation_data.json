    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, known as tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **α-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** While there are hydrogens on these alpha carbons, they are attached to sp²-hybridized carbons. The typical keto-enol tautomerism mechanism requires an α-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon. The system is conjugated, but it lacks the structural feature for tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding hydroquinone (a di-phenol) is a reduction reaction (involving the addition of 2 protons and 2 electrons), not a simple tautomeric shift.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** These -CH₂- groups have α-hydrogens. Furthermore, these hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups (this is known as an active methylene group).\n    *   **Tautomerization:** The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to easily undergo tautomerization to form its enol tautomer, which is **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene)**. The enol form is aromatic, making it exceptionally stable. Therefore, the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The central carbon (C2) is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the C2 atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Any molecule containing a single chiral center is chiral and will therefore have a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate. Its structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, with the `-COOCH₃` groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism. (It does show *geometric* isomerism, with dimethyl maleate being its *cis* isomer).\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
