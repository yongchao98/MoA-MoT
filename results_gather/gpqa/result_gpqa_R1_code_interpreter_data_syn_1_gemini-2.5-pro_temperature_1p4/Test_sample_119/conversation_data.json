    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Uniform star distribution:** The number density of stars, denoted by `ρ`, is constant throughout space. This means the number of stars in any given volume is `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance `d` to a star. `plx = 1/d`. For simplicity, we can assume `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   **Target quantity:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the stars located in a thin spherical shell around the observer. The shell has a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell: `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Convert from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Our expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to convert it into terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. When we consider the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that `d` increases as `plx` decreases). We take `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   Start with the equation for the number of stars in the shell: `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`.\n    *   Replace `d²` with `(1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n    *   Replace `dd` with `(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The equation becomes: `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   Simplifying this gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Find the proportionality:**\n    *   In the expression `4πρ / plx⁴`, the terms `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (the uniform star density) are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx^1\nB) ~ 1/plx^3\nC) ~ 1/plx^2\nD) ~ 1/plx^4\n\nOur derived proportionality matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
