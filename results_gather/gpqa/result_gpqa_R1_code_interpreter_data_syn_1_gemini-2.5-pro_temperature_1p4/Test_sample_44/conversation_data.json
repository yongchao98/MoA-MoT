    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are fermions.\n*   **Fermions and Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a potential well, the state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π²ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Energy of the Ground State (E_gs)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We have four particles to place.\n\n*   **n=1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). This level is now full.\n*   **n=2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the next two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). This level is now full.\n\nAll four particles have been placed in the lowest possible energy configuration.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\nE_gs = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 2 particles in n=2)\nE_gs = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂)\nE_gs = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy of the First Excited State (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the ground state. We create it by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n\nSo, we move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   One particle in n=2.\n*   One particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=2) + (Energy of 1 particle in n=3)\nE_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\nE_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n### **4. Calculate the Energy of the Second Excited State (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state that would have a higher energy than the first excited state and find the one with the lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and calculate their total energies:\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy = 10E.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 15E.\n\nNow consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. This would leave one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. This would leave two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (E₄ = 4²E = 16E). This would leave two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### **Summary of Energies**\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n```python\n# The base energy unit is E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2).\n# Single-particle energy levels are E_n = n^2 * E.\n# We have 4 spin-1/2 fermions, so a maximum of 2 particles can be in any energy level 'n'.\n\n# Ground State: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\nE_ground = 2 * (1**2) + 2 * (2**2)\n\n# First Excited State: Move one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\nE_first_excited = 2 * (1**2) + 1 * (2**2) + 1 * (3**2)\n\n# Second Excited State: This is the next lowest energy state.\n# We compare the energies of the next possible excitations from the ground state.\n# Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.

    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Key Concepts:**\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and the spin projection (`m_s`). For spin-1/2 particles, `m_s` can be +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the single-particle energy levels are given by `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`, so `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy configuration. We fill the energy levels from the lowest `n` upwards, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We have four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    `E_gs = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n**3. Calculation of First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n*   We move one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in n=1.\n    *   One particle in n=2.\n    *   One particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    `E_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n**4. Calculation of Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the next possible single-particle promotions from the ground state.\n*   **Possibility (a): Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy: `(1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility (b): Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.** (E₄ = 4²E = 16E)\n    *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (18E and 22E), the lower one corresponds to the second excited state.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
