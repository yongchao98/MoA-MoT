    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. A cornerstone of such theories is that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This is encoded in Lorentz symmetry. The SMEFT Lagrangian is built from operators that are scalars under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime and includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. As with Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental assumption in the construction of any relativistic quantum field theory, including SMEFT. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Thus, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model (SM) itself is known to violate CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (e.g., through the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it not only incorporates the SM's CP violation but can also introduce new sources of CP violation through the higher-dimensional operators. The Wilson coefficients of these operators can be complex, leading to CP-violating phenomena beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry of all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge Conjugation, Parity, and Time Reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of these fundamental principles, which is far more drastic than the goals of SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the fundamental principles used to construct SMEFT, it must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). It does not, however, need to respect CP symmetry (3).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of symmetries is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
