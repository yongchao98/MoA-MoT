    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO).**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n*   **Â¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield from benzene (7.26 ppm), indicating that at least one substituent is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is very typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen atom explains the 'N' in the molecular formula. This confirms the presence of an aniline moiety.\n    *   Combining these, we have a p-substituted aniline fragment: `H2N-C6H4-`. This accounts for C6H6N and 6 protons (4 aromatic, 2 amine).\n    *   **Remaining atoms and protons:** The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Subtracting the aniline fragment (`C6H6N`) leaves `C2H3O`. The remaining NMR signals must account for these atoms and the 3 remaining protons.\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal at ~9.7 ppm is unequivocally an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), meaning it's next to a -CH2- group. This gives us the fragment `-CH2-CHO`.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) splitting means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment (an acetaldehyde group). The chemical shift of 3.66 ppm is consistent with a methylene group alpha to both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring (benzylic).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** We have a p-substituted aniline (`H2N-C6H4-`) and an acetaldehyde group (`-CH2-CHO`). Attaching the acetaldehyde group at the para position gives the final structure.\n\n*   **Structure of Starting Material:** **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Formula: C8H9NO (C6H4+NH2+CH2CHO = C8H9NO). Correct.\n    *   This structure is the most logical fit for all the provided data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a standard two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (Diazotization): The primary amine group (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperature to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        `H2N-C6H4-CH2-CHO -> [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO`\n    *   Step 2 (Hydrolysis): The diazonium salt is unstable and, upon warming in water, hydrolyzes. The -N2+ group leaves as N2 gas and is replaced by an -OH group.\n        `[N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO + H2O -> HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + N2 + H+`\n    *   The product after the first two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating the aldehyde product (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   The aldehyde has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group), which are acidic.\n    *   These conditions are classic for an **Aldol Condensation**. This is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to give the aldol addition product. The structure of this product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n            `(p-HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(p-HO-Ph)-CHO`\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated system. Elimination involves the -OH group (from C3) and an acidic proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C4).\n            *   The proton on C2 is alpha to the aldehyde's carbonyl group, making it particularly acidic. Its removal leads to a C=C double bond between C2 and C3.\n            *   The resulting product is `(p-HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(p-HO-Ph)-CHO`.\n            *   The double bond in this product is conjugated with both the carbonyl group (`C=C-C=O`) and one of the phenyl rings, making it a very stable (thermodynamically favored) product.\n            *   Let's name this product: The main chain is a but-2-enal. It has a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2 and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4. So the name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe final product of the entire sequence is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   Structure: `(p-HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(p-HO-Ph)-CHO`\n*   Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n*   Option A is incorrect (lacks OH groups, wrong double bond position).\n*   Option C is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heat.\n*   Option D is a different structure that would not be formed by this self-condensation reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
