    "An optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `ClCH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. All the atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (`3aR, 7aS`) and the geometry of a double bond (`E`). Designating a specific stereoisomer (like R or S) means the molecule is chiral and the named compound is a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. It is highly improbable for a molecule with such complexity and specific stereochemistry to be a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The (2R,3S) stereoisomer is a meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers constitute a pair of enantiomers. As the name specifies a single enantiomer (`2R,3R`), this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (bearing the -OH group) is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a highly symmetrical substitution pattern. With three identical hydroxyl groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of a cyclohexane ring, the molecule possesses elements of symmetry regardless of the specific diastereomer. For instance, the all-cis isomer has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-Cyclopentyl`. We can analyze this structure for chirality. There are no stereocenters. The carbon in the `CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule as a whole is achiral (it possesses a plane of symmetry that can bisect the carbonyl group). Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\nSummary:\n- Compound 1: Not optically active.\n- Compound 2: **Optically active**.\n- Compound 3: Not optically active (meso).\n- Compound 4: **Optically active**.\n- Compound 5: **Optically active**.\n- Compound 6: Not optically active.\n- Compound 7: Not optically active.\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list. To confirm, we can use a simple script to tally the results.\n\n```python\n# A compound is optically active if it is chiral.\n# True represents an optically active compound, False represents an achiral one.\n\n# Analysis summary:\n# 1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> False\n# 2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Named as a single enantiomer -> True\n# 3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound -> False\n# 4.

    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to check if the molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks any elements of internal symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A molecule is chiral if it has a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks internal symmetry. This molecule has no stereocenters. The carbons of the double bond are bonded to only three groups. The other carbons are part of methyl or ethyl groups, which do not have four different substituents.\n    *   Furthermore, the plane containing the `C=C` double bond is a plane of symmetry for the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bicyclic molecule. The IUPAC name provides the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (`3aR, 7aS`).\n    *   The designation of a specific stereoisomer (like `R` or `S`) indicates that the molecule is chiral and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   It is highly improbable for such a complex molecule with specified stereochemistry to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the configuration `(2R,3S)` is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral despite having stereocenters because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion).\n    *   The symmetry element makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` stereoisomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, `(2R,3R)`, this compound is **chiral** and lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 1 (C1), which is attached to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This molecule has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(s)` notation, similar to `cis`, indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   Due to this high degree of symmetry, the molecule possesses multiple symmetry elements, including a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   Therefore, it is not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a stereocenter. Let's check the carbons:\n        *   The isopropyl group `(CH3)2CH-` has a carbon bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a stereocenter.\n        *   The `-CH2-` group has two identical hydrogen atoms.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon `C=O` is sp2-hybridized.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring is symmetrical.\n    *   There are no stereocenters in this molecule. It possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Optically Active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not Optically Active:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
