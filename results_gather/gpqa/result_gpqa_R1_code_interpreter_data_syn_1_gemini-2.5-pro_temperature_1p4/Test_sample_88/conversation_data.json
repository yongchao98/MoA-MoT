    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ and ¹H NMR spectrum with a total of 14 protons.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group. The frequency is consistent with a ketone within a strained ring system like adamantane.\n    *   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂), has 14 hydrogen atoms. The product also has 14 hydrogen atoms. If the product is a ketone, its formula would be C₁₀H₁₄O. The most plausible structure for a ketone with the adamantane skeleton is **adamantan-2-one**.\n    *   There is a significant contradiction with the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 (specifically the signal at 4.79 ppm, which is too far downfield for a saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one). Furthermore, a subsequent reaction (ozonolysis) implies the presence of a C=C double bond, which adamantan-2-one lacks.\n    *   Given these contradictions, it's likely that either the provided NMR data for Product 1 is erroneous or serves as a distraction, or a very unusual rearrangement occurs. Let's proceed by assuming the most chemically plausible product based on the IR data and the reaction sequence, which is adamantan-2-one, and that the subsequent steps will clarify the path.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. So, adamantan-2-one would be reduced to adamantan-2-ol.\n    *   However, the next step involves ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This means Product 2 is not the alcohol itself, but an alkene derived from it.\n    *   Heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid (like Al(O-iPr)₃) can cause dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form an alkene.\n    *   Dehydration of adamantan-2-ol is not straightforward. A simple elimination of water would require forming a double bond at a bridgehead position (e.g., between C2 and C1/C3), which is highly unfavorable due to Bredt's rule.\n    *   Under these conditions, a carbocation is formed at C2, which then undergoes a skeletal rearrangement (Wagner-Meerwein shift) to a more stable structure, followed by elimination of a proton to form an alkene. The known product of this reaction is **protoadamantene** (specifically, tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamantene (C₁₀H₁₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This is a standard ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the C=C double bond and, after reductive workup with DMS, converts each carbon of the double bond into a carbonyl group. Since both carbons in the double bond of protoadamantene are CH groups, they will both be converted to aldehyde (CHO) groups.\n    *   The cleavage of the C=C bond in the tricyclic protoadamantene opens one of the rings, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde. The product is known to be **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n    *   To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3, we first need to identify that proton. In a dialdehyde, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (H-C=O), which typically appear at 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Now, we must determine the splitting pattern of these aldehyde protons. Let's analyze the connectivity around the double bond in the precursor, protoadamant-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5.\n        *   C4 is bonded to C3, which is a methine group (CH).\n        *   C5 is bonded to C6, which is a methylene group (CH₂).\n    *   Upon ozonolysis:\n        *   The C4 atom becomes an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) bonded to the C3 methine group (`-CH-`). The proton of this aldehyde group is coupled to the single proton on C3. According to the n+1 rule, its signal will be a **doublet**.\n        *   The C5 atom becomes an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) bonded to the C6 methylene group (`-CH₂-`). The proton of this aldehyde group is coupled to the two protons on C6. According to the n+1 rule, its signal will be a **triplet**.\n    *   Thus, Product 3 has two non-equivalent aldehyde protons, one appearing as a doublet and the other as a triplet. Both are the most deshielded protons in the molecule.\n    *   The question asks for \"the\" coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom. Looking at the options provided:\n        A) triplet\n        B) doublet of triplets\n        C) pentet\n        D) triplet of triplets\n    *   \"Triplet\" is an option, while \"doublet\" is not. This strongly implies that the triplet is the expected answer. It is reasonable to assume one of the two aldehyde signals is the most deshielded, and its pattern is a triplet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most deshielded proton in product 3 is an aldehyde proton. The structure of product 3 contains a `-CH₂-CHO` moiety, which results in the aldehyde proton's signal being split into a triplet by the two adjacent methylene protons.\n\n<<<A>>>"
