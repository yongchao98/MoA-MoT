    "*   **Analysis of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a C=C bond, typical for an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **~10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a `-CH₂CH₃` fragment (an ethyl group).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** Piecing the fragments together, we have a methine group attached to the benzene ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This forms a *sec*-butyl group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        Based on the analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A, which is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents capable of completely reducing a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be converted to a methyl group. The benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl substituent will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Identification of the Final Product**\n\n    1.  **Start with:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    2.  **Apply the reaction:** Reduce the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    3.  **The resulting product is:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This correctly represents the product where the carboxylic acid has been reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is incorrect. The reduction reaction does not cause a rearrangement of the *sec*-butyl skeleton to an isobutyl skeleton.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
