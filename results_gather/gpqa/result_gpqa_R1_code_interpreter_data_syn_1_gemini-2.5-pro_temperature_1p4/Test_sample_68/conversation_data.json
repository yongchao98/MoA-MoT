    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. \"Observing a decay\" implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** A moving particle's lifetime is extended in the laboratory frame due to relativistic time dilation. The probability of a particle surviving after traveling a certain distance follows an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Parameters:** First, we calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) of the $X^0$ particle. The total energy ($E$) of a particle is related to its rest mass ($m$) and $\\gamma$ by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   Given Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Given Mass, $m c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    \n    The Lorentz factor is:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda$. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   The lab frame lifetime is dilated from the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    *   So, $\\lambda = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    *   A more direct formula uses the particle's momentum ($p$): $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$. The decay length is then $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0$.\n\n4.  **Condition for Observation:** Let the detector resolution be $L$. To observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance $d$ greater than $L$. We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, which means the probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than $L$ must be at least 0.30.\n    *   The probability of a particle traveling a distance $d$ or more is given by $P(d \\geq L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n    *   So, we need to satisfy the condition: $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Distance:** To find the maximum resolution that would still allow observing 30% of the decays, we solve for the equality:\n    *   $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   Solving for $L$: $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.30)$.\n\nThis value of $L$ represents the characteristic distance such that 30% of the particles will travel at least this far. Any detector with a resolution better than (i.e., smaller than or equal to) this value $L$ will be able to resolve at least 30% of the decays. Therefore, this value corresponds to the required resolution.\n\nNow, we perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm_c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the momentum-energy term pc\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau0\n\n# The condition is that at least 30% of decays are observed.\n# This means for a resolution L, we want the probability P(distance > L) >= 0.3.\n# P(distance > L) = exp(-L / lambda).\n# So, we solve for L in exp(-L / lambda) = 0.3\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nfraction = 0.30\nresolution = -mean_decay_length * np.log(fraction)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{resolution:.2e} m\")\n```\n> 실행 결과\n> 2.27e-06 m\n\nThe calculation yields a required resolution of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is closest to option B. The slight difference between the calculated value and the option is likely due to using slightly different values for the speed of light or minor rounding in the problem's provided options.\n\n*   Calculated Value: $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   Option A: $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   Option B: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   Option C: $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n*   Option D: $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOption B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. \"Observing a decay\" means that the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### 1. Relativistic Parameters\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the relativistic parameters for the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n\nThe particle's momentum, $p$, can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 2. Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is dilated from its proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$.\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, known as the mean decay length $\\lambda$, is given by:\n$\\lambda = v\\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta c (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (\\beta\\gamma) c \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$. The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the momentum: $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}$.\n\n$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}\\right) c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Required Resolution\n\nThe probability that a particle survives for a distance $L$ or more follows an exponential decay law:\n$P(d \\geq L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n\nTo observe at least 30% of the decays, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $L$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $L$ that satisfies:\n$P(d \\geq L) \\geq 0.30$\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required. This is somewhat ambiguously phrased, as a better (smaller) resolution will always observe a higher percentage of decays. The phrasing is best interpreted as asking for the *maximum* resolution that would still allow for the observation of at least 30% of the decays. We find this limiting value by solving the equality:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$L = \\lambda \\times 1.204$\n$L = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis is the value calculated by the Python script.\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nThe calculated value for the resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B. The small discrepancy (around 9%) between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is likely due to slightly different constants or rounding being used to generate the problem options. For instance, if the energy were 25 GeV instead of 27 GeV, the calculated resolution would be approximately $2.095 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is very close to option B.\n\nGiven the choices, option B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
