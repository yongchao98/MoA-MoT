    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOMe)₂. In the presence of the base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, ⁻CH(COOMe)₂. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`. The β-carbon is electrophilic and will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOMe)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The product structure is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂(α) - COOMe`.\n    *   Let's analyze the names provided in the options:\n        *   **Options A/B:** \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\". Let's deduce the structure from this name. The parent acid is propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid substituted with a p-tolyl group at position 2.\n            *   Parent Acid Skeleton: C1-C2-C3.\n            *   Groups: two -COOH at C1, one -p-tolyl at C2, one -COOH at C3.\n            *   This gives the structure: `(HOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOH`.\n            *   The trimethyl ester is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n            *   Let's compare this to our derived product: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂ - COOMe`. These two structures are identical. So, this name, although non-systematic, correctly describes the Michael adduct.\n        *   **Options C/D:** \"trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate\". The structure for this name would be `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(COOMe)-CH₂(p-tolyl)`. This is not the product of the Michael addition.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael addition. The nucleophile is an enamine.\n    *   **Enamine (Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n    *   The reaction is followed by acidic hydrolysis (H₃O⁺).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, forming an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent hydrolysis with H₃O⁺ converts the iminium ion back into a ketone. The overall result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The starting ketone is cyclohexanone. The alkylating agent is derived from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The substituent added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position (α-position).\n    *   Let's name this product. It is a butanenitrile derivative. The main chain is `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. The substituent at position 3 is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   So, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This matches options A and B.\n    *   The name in options C and D, \"3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile\", describes the enol tautomer. The keto form is the major, more stable product under these conditions.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type (in reverse):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition. We need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the donor's nucleophilic carbon and the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   The product is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group at the C2 position. The structure of the substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   This substituent is formed from MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`) upon addition and protonation. The β-carbon of MVK becomes the CH₂ group attached to the ring.\n    *   The nucleophile must have donated the proton from C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C2 position is highly acidic because it's flanked by two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C, the Michael donor, is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. This matches options B and C.\n    *   The name in options A and D, \"2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\", describes an unstable hydrated form (gem-diol). The stable reactant is the diketone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nCombining these findings, only option B contains all three correct identifications.\n\n<<<B>>>"
