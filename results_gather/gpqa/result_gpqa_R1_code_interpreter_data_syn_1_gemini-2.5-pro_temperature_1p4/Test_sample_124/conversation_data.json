    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the frequency $\\omega$ is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system can be conveniently solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates. The total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic oscillator are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_N = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $N=0$. This requires $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $N=1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways that three non-negative integers can sum to the principal quantum number $N$. We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, which corresponds to $N=3$.\n\n    We need to find all combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    To systematically count these, a small python script can be written.\n```python\nN = 3\ncount = 0\ncombinations = []\nfor nx in range(N + 1):\n    for ny in range(N + 1 - nx):\n        nz = N - nx - ny\n        if nz >= 0:\n            count += 1\n            combinations.append((nx, ny, nz))\n            \nprint(f\"Number of combinations (degeneracy) for N=3 is: {count}\")\nprint(f\"The combinations are: {combinations}\")\n```\nExecuting the code confirms the count.\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations manually:\n*   **Permutations of (3, 0, 0):** (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states.\n*   **Permutations of (2, 1, 0):** (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states.\n*   **Permutations of (1, 1, 1):** (1, 1, 1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For the third excited state ($N=3$), the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** For the third excited state ($N=3$):\n    *   The energy is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) (9/2) ħω, 10 — This matches our result.\n    *   B) 11π²ħ² / (2mr²), 3 — Incorrect energy formula (it resembles particle in a box) and incorrect degeneracy.\n    *   C) (9/2) ħω, 3 — Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy (3 is the degeneracy of the first excited state).\n    *   D) 11π²ħ² / (2mr²), 10 — Incorrect energy formula.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning the total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $N$.\n*   **Ground State:** $N = 0$, $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$, $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$, $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$, $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways that three non-negative integers can sum to $N=3$.\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n2.  One number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n3.  All numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of combinations (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$. This is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy level $E_3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$. For $N=3$, the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.
