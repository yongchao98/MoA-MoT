    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis starting from cyclohexanone. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (Product 4), we must first determine the structure of Product 4 by identifying the product of each reaction step.\n\n*   **Step 1: cyclohexanone + bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   Cyclohexanone is symmetric, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   This step involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). There are two primary competing reaction pathways:\n        1.  **E2 Elimination:** The base abstracts a proton from the carbon beta to the bromine (C3) to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which would be cyclohex-2-enone.\n        2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is more acidic. The resulting enolate undergoes an internal nucleophilic attack, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide and rearranges, leading to a ring contraction. The final product after acidic workup (implicit in this type of reaction) is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   For 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Favorskii rearrangement leads to **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Which pathway is more likely?** The subsequent reaction steps provide a strong clue. Step 3 uses SOCl₂ and step 4 uses LiAlH(OtBu)₃. This specific sequence of reagents is classic for the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde (Carboxylic Acid → Acyl Chloride → Aldehyde). This strongly suggests that Product 2 is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Its most characteristic use is the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and will stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (Product 4)**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C-C bond connecting the aldehyde to the ring, the hydrogen atom on that ring carbon (C1), and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This symmetry plane makes pairs of atoms and groups equivalent.\n    *   The carbon C1 (attached to CHO) is unique.\n    *   Carbon C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbon C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **Hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom attached to C1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde group) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry. On any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1 (C1 is a prochiral center). This means they are not equivalent to each other. Let's call them H2-cis and H2-trans (relative to the aldehyde group). Due to the symmetry plane, H2-cis is equivalent to H5-cis, and H2-trans is equivalent to H5-trans. Therefore, these four hydrogens constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    4.  **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives rise to two more distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>"
