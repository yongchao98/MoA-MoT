    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the System and State Variables**\n    *   Initial State: An electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$) moving towards each other along the x-axis.\n    *   Final State: Two photons ($\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$).\n    *   We need to use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron's rest mass).\n    *   Let $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n    The energy of a particle with rest mass $m$, and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    The magnitude of the momentum $p$ is related to energy by the formula $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma m c^2)^2 - (m c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} m_e c^2$.\n\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Moves from the left (we'll assume the +x direction).\n        *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n        *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum (magnitude): $p_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_e = (\\frac{\\sqrt{15} m_e c^2}{c}, 0, 0) = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Moves from the right (we'll assume the -x direction).\n        *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum (magnitude): $p_p c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$.\n        *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3} m_e c^2}{c}, 0, 0) = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Total Initial System:**\n        *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Total Momentum: $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Energy and Momentum**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons.

    "The problem asks for the angle between two photons produced from the annihilation of an electron and a positron moving towards each other. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Define Initial State**\n\n*   We have an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$). They have the same rest mass, which we'll call $m_e$.\n*   Let's set up a coordinate system where the collision occurs at the origin. The particles move along the x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from the left (in the +x direction) with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   The positron moves from the right (in the -x direction) with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\nThe magnitude of its momentum $p$ is given by the relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, which can be rearranged to $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} mc^2$.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n    *   Momentum: $p_e c = \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$. The momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n    *   Momentum: $p_p c = \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$. Since it's moving in the -x direction, the momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum: $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**3. Define Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of two photons, $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\n*   Photons have zero rest mass. Their energy and momentum are related by $E_\\gamma = p_\\gamma c$.\n*   The problem states they have the same energy: $E_{\\gamma_1} = E_{\\gamma_2} = E_\\gamma$.\n*   This implies their momentum magnitudes are also equal: $p_{\\gamma_1} = p_{\\gamma_2} = p_\\gamma$.\n*   One photon moves upper-right (angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis) and the other moves lower-right (angle $-\\phi$ with the x-axis).\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{final} = E_{initial}$\n    *   $E_{\\gamma_1} + E_{\\gamma_2} = 6 m_e c^2$\n    *   $2E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma/c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{P}_{initial}$\n    *   Let the two photons' momentum vectors be $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma_1}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma_2}$.\n    *   **y-component:** The initial y-momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total y-momentum must also be zero.\n        *   $p_{\\gamma_1, y} + p_{\\gamma_2, y} = 0$\n        *   $p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\phi) = 0$\n        *   $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\phi)$, which means the angles are equal in magnitude, $\\theta = \\phi$. The photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis. Let the angles be $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n    *   **x-component:**\n        *   $P_{final, x} = P_{initial, x}$\n        *   $p_{\\gamma_1, x} + p_{\\gamma_2, x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\n        *   $p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\n        *   Since $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$, we have $2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\n*   Substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$ into the x-momentum equation:\n    *   $2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\n    *   $6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\n*   Divide by $6 m_e c$:\n    *   $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n*   The angle we want is the angle *between* the two photons, which is $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n*   First, we find $\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)$.\n*   The final angle is $2\\theta$. We can calculate this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians from the cosine value\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the directions of the two photons is 2*theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 138.19 degrees.
