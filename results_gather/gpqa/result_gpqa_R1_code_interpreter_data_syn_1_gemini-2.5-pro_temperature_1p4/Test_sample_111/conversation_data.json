    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State `|alpha>`**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet's represent this state as a column vector in the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`:\n`|alpha>_unnormalized = [(1+i), (2-i)]^T`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find the squared norm, which is `<alpha|alpha>`. This is calculated as the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.\n`c1 = 1+i`, `|c1|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`c2 = 2-i`, `|c2|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5`\n\nThe squared norm is `|c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7`.\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1 / sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n**2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**\n\nThe problem defines the matrix elements of operator A as `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives the eigenvalues: `λ_1 = +hbar/2` and `λ_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [a, b]^T = (hbar/2) * [a, b]^T`\n    `[b, a]^T = [a, b]^T`, which implies `a = b`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate:\n    `|v1> = (1/sqrt(1^2 + 1^2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   For `λ_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [a, b]^T = (-hbar/2) * [a, b]^T`\n    `[b, a]^T = [-a, -b]^T`, which implies `b = -a`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the eigenstate:\n    `|v2> = (1/sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in a specific eigenstate is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the system's state with that eigenstate.\n\n*   **Probability P1 (for eigenstate |v1>):** `P1 = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability P2 (for eigenstate |v2>):** `P2 = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value `<A>`**\n\nThe average value can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities.**\n    `<A> = P1 * λ_1 + P2 * λ_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = hbar * (2/14) = hbar / 7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar / 14) * 2 = hbar / 7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`, and the average value of the operator A is `hbar / 7`.
