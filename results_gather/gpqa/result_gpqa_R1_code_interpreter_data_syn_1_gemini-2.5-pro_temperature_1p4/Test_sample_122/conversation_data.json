    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the reference frames:**\n*   The Galaxy's reference frame (S): This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   The ejecta's reference frame (S'): This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n\n**3. Determine the goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n**4. The Physics:**\n*   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame, we use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n*   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` compared to the time `Δt'` measured in the moving ejecta's frame (S').\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**5. Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the ratio `v/c` (beta).**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time (dt) in the Galaxy's frame\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame\nd = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{d:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n**6. Compare with options:**\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the option.\n\nNote: A common mistake is to confuse the reference frames and use length contraction, which would give a different result (`d = v * Δt' * γ`), or to ignore relativity and calculate `d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option B). The correct approach requires calculating the dilated time in the observer's (Galaxy's) frame first.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference from our perspective as an observer within the Galaxy.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it is measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n**3. Apply the Principles of Special Relativity**\n\nThe distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula:\n`d = v * Δt`\n\nHere, `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame. Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval than an observer in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n\nThe relationship between the time in the two frames is given by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the velocity ratio (β)**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - β²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    Calculating the value: `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame**\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the Python script which gave a result of `3061862` km.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,860 km`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativistic effects, i.e., `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
