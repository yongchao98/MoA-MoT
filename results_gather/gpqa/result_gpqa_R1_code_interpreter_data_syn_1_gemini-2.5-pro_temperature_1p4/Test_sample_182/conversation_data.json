    "Here's the reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's first determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   **Core structure**: A six-membered carbon ring (cyclohexane).\n    *   **\"-3-ene\"**: A double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   **\"-carboxylic acid\"**: A -COOH group is at position 1. This is the highest priority group, so it defines C1.\n    *   **\"2-formyl\"**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   **\"5-vinyl\"**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: We can count them systematically. A cyclohexane ring with one double bond and substituents at C1, C2, and C5.\n        *   Ring Hydrogens: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7H.\n        *   Substituent Hydrogens: H from -COOH (1H) + H from -CHO (1H) + H from -CH=CH₂ (3H) = 5H.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\n    So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Alkene double bonds (C=C)** are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    This means all pi bonds (C=C and C=O) will be saturated, and all oxygen atoms will be removed from the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:**\n    The reaction preserves the carbon skeleton. The reactant has a 10-carbon skeleton that includes a six-membered ring.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `-COOH` group at C1 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The `-CHO` group at C2 becomes a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`) at C5 becomes an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The carbon count remains 10. For a saturated monocyclic alkane with 'n' carbons, the general formula is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n    Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C, H, X, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    For the product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the IHD by looking at the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\ndef calculate_ihd(formula):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for a molecular formula.\n    The formula is a dictionary with atom symbols as keys and counts as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    C = formula.get('C', 0)\n    H = formula.get('H', 0)\n    X = formula.get('X', 0)  # Halogens\n    N = formula.get('N', 0)\n    \n    # IHD formula: C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    ihd = C - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2) + 1\n    return int(ihd)\n\n# Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid -> C10H12O3\nreactant_formula = {'C': 10, 'H': 12, 'O': 3}\nihd_reactant = calculate_ihd(reactant_formula)\n\n# Product: Saturated monocyclic alkane from complete reduction -> C10H20\nproduct_formula = {'C': 10, 'H': 20}\nihd_product = calculate_ihd(product_formula)\n\nprint(f\"IHD of reactant (C10H12O3): {ihd_reactant}\")\nprint(f\"IHD of product (C10H20): {ihd_product}\")\n```\nThe script will output the IHD for both the reactant and the product. We are interested in the IHD of the product.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and an excess of HI.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    *   The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula. The structure has:\n        *   A 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n        *   A double bond in the ring (`-3-ene`).\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n        *   An aldehyde group (-CHO, or formyl) at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reagent is a combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing agent. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   The specific reductions that will occur are:\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n        *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The reaction does not change the carbon skeleton. The product will still have 10 carbon atoms arranged in the same way (a 6-membered ring with substituents).\n    *   The final product will be a fully saturated hydrocarbon. The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: Using the formula**\n        IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n        IHD = 11 - 10\n        IHD = 1\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the structure**\n        The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n        *   Number of rings = 1\n        *   Number of pi bonds (C=C or C=O) = 0 (it is fully saturated)\n        *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
