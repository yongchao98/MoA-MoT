    "This problem involves a weak acid-strong base titration. We need to calculate the pH at two specific points: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n- Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm3 = 0.0200 L\n- Initial concentration of acetic acid (C1) = 0.05 M\n- Volume of water added = 20.00 cm3\n- Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.0400 L\nUsing the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2:\nC2 = (C1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: Moles of Acetic Acid**\nNow, let's find the initial number of moles of acetic acid (HA) in the diluted solution.\nMoles of HA = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n**Step 3: pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A-). This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O\n- Moles of HA reacted = 0.25 * 0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol\n- Moles of A- formed = 0.00025 mol\n- Moles of HA remaining = 0.75 * 0.00100 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.733\nNow, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since the conjugate base and acid are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (0.00100 mol).\nFirst, we need to find the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point. This requires calculating the volume of NaOH added.\nVolume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm3\nTotal volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\nTotal volume = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.0500 L\nNow, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A-]) at the equivalence point:\n[A-] = Moles of acetate / Total volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\nThe acetate ion, being a weak base, hydrolyzes in water:\nA- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\nWe need to find the concentration of OH-. We can do this using the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10\nNow we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\nKb = [HA][OH-] / [A-]\nLet [OH-] = [HA] = x. The change in [A-] is negligible.\nKb ≈ x^2 / [A-]\nx^2 = Kb * [A-] = (5.405 x 10^-10) * (0.020) = 1.081 x 10^-11\nx = [OH-] = √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020\nvol_water_added = 0.020\nconc_NaOH = 0.1\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Dilution and initial moles\nfinal_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + vol_water_added\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid\nmoles_acid_initial = conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid\n\n# Step 3: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 4: pH at equivalence point\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid_initial / conc_NaOH\ntotal_vol_eq = final_vol_acid + vol_NaOH_eq\nconc_acetate_eq = moles_acid_initial / total_vol_eq\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_conc_eq = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_eq)\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc_eq)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThe calculated values are:\n- pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n- pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points in a weak acid-strong base titration.\n\n**1. Initial State after Dilution**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after being diluted.\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (C₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the diluted acid (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula C₁V₁ = C₂V₂, the new concentration (C₂) is:\nC₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nThe initial number of moles of acetic acid to be titrated is:\nMoles of CH₃COOH = C₂ * V₂ = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.25 * 0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.75 * 0.00100 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKₐ + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ:\npKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, substitute the mole ratio into the equation (since they are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles):\npH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ at equivalence = 0.00100 mol\n\nFirst, we need the total volume of the solution. We calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize 0.00100 mol of acid:\nVolume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\nThe total volume at the equivalence point is:\nTotal Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n\nThe concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point is:\n[CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kₑ, for acetate:\nKₑ = Kₗ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]. Let [OH⁻] = x.\nKₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020)\nx² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nCalculate the pOH and then the pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values for pH at 25% titration (4.26) and at the equivalence point (8.52) match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
