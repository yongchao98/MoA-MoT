    "Here is the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached directly to the carbons of the double bond. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a key piece of evidence. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C + Mass of O + Mass of O + Mass of H = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragment is very common for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion from Mass Spec:** This confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize all Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to a molecule that is an **alkenoic acid** (a carboxylic acid containing a C=C double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   The structure contains at least two sources of unsaturation: one from the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one from the C=C bond. Therefore, the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the molecule must be at least 2.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options, A and D, using the formula: `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1` (oxygen atoms don't affect the calculation).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula string like 'C6H10O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    \n    C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n    H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n    # N = atoms.get('N', 0)  # Not needed for these options\n    # X = 0  # Halogens not present\n    \n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dou\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Calculating Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):\")\nfor label, formula in options.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {label}) {formula}: DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\nprint(\"The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"This requires:\")\nprint(\"1.

This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. --> MISMATCH\")\n\n```\nCalculating Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):\nOption A) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\nOption B) C6H12O: DoU = 1\nOption C) C6H10O: DoU = 2\nOption D) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\n\nAnalysis:\nThe compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\nThis requires:\n1. Two oxygen atoms (for -COOH group).\n2. A Degree of Unsaturation of at least 2 (one for C=O, one for C=C).\n\nEvaluating options against requirements:\nA) C6H10O2: Has 2 oxygens and DoU = 2.  --> MATCH\nB) C6H12O: Has 1 oxygen. --> MISMATCH\nC) C6H10O: Has 1 oxygen. --> MISMATCH\nD) C6H12O2: Has 2 oxygens but DoU = 1. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. --> MISMATCH\n\nOnly the formula C6H10O2 satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectroscopic data: it has two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group, and it has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which accounts for both the carbonyl (C=O) bond and the alkene (C=C) bond.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process based on the provided spectroscopic data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, and this specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is in the region for an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** directly confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group, as these are hydrogens attached to the carbons of the double bond. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   *Conclusion from Mass Spec*: This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the data, we know the molecule must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n    *   We also know the molecule contains a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O double bond of the acid. This requires a **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the remaining options, A and D. The formula is `DoU = C - (H/2) + 1`.\n\n        *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n        *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, meaning the carbon chain must be saturated (no C=C bond). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
