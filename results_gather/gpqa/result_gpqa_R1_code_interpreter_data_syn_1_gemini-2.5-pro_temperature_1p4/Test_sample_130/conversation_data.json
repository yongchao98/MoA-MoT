    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (all protons are equivalent) at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (two types of carbons) at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest cis-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data matches maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n            *   ¹H NMR: It has two chemically equivalent protons on the double bond. They would appear as a singlet. A shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons flanked by electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n            *   ¹³C NMR: It has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two signals. A carbonyl carbon resonance around 165 ppm and a vinyl carbon resonance around 137 ppm are very typical.\n        *   Thus, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is between a diene and a dienophile, which is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n        *   The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclopentadiene derivative and a cyclic dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   This reaction can lead to two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n        *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the diene's π-system. This orientation is favored by secondary orbital overlap and is typically the **kinetically controlled major product**.\n        *   The *exo* product has the anhydride part oriented away from the diene's π-system. It is sterically less hindered and is typically the **thermodynamically controlled product**, often the minor product under standard conditions.\n    *   Since the problem mentions a major and a minor product, it's safe to assume we have formed both the *endo* and *exo* adducts, with the **major product being the *endo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   First, let's identify the different types of protons in the product and assign the signals given in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry in both isomers.\n        *   **Vinyl methyls (Me_v):** Two CH₃ groups on the C=C bond. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). Vinyl methyl protons typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_b):** Two CH₃ groups on the bridgehead carbons. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded than the vinyl methyls. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_a):** Two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Equivalent by symmetry. (2H total). These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. Let's assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons (CH₂):** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are diastereotopic and not equivalent. They would appear as two distinct 1H signals (likely complex multiplets or doublets of doublets). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in some options.\n\n4.  **Compare Interproton Distances in *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers**\n\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the CH₂ bridge, meaning it is tucked \"underneath\" the newly formed six-membered ring, towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are spatially close to the protons on the double bond, which are the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. A strong NOE cross-peak between H_a and Me_v is expected.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. An NOE cross-peak is not expected.\n\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are now far from the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. The NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are now spatially close to the **CH₂ bridge protons**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak**\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** (*endo*) but **absent in the minor product** (*exo*).\n    *   Based on our analysis, this is the cross-peak between the **anhydride protons (H_a)** and the **vinyl methyl protons (Me_v)**.\n\n6.  **Match the Protons to the NMR Signals in the Options**\n    *   Vinyl methyl protons (Me_v) = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   Anhydride protons (H_a) = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects these two signals.\n\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options:\n        *   A) Me_b and a bridge proton: This NOE should be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) A bridge proton and H_a: This NOE is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n        *   C) Me_b and Me_v: This NOE should be present in both isomers as they are on adjacent carbons.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a cross-peak unique to the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
