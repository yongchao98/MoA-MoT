    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The planet and star orbit their common center of mass. This causes the star to move towards and away from us, leading to a shift in its spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** The observed quantity is the wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$. This is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by the Doppler formula: $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The maximum periodic shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n    Since the same spectral line is observed for both stars, the rest wavelength $\\lambda_0$ is the same. Therefore, the semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:** We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n4.  **Find the Relationship between K and Orbital Period (P):** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star} \\sin i}{P}$\n    where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_{star}$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n    From the definition of the center of mass, $M_{star} a_{star} = m_p a_p$, where $m_p$ is the planet's mass and $a_p$ is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since the planet is much less massive than the star ($m_p \\ll M_{star}$), we can approximate the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ with the total system's semi-major axis $a$. So, $a_{star} \\approx \\frac{m_p}{M_{star}} a$.\n    Substituting this into the formula for $K$:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{m_p a}{M_{star}} \\right) \\sin i$\n\n    Now, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate $a$ and $P$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + m_p)} a^3 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3$\n    Solving for $a$:\n    $a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute this expression for $a$ back into the equation for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P} \\cdot a \\cdot \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\propto \\frac{1}{P} \\cdot P^{2/3} \\cdot \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{1-1/3}} \\propto P^{-1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   In the absence of information about the orbital inclinations, we assume they are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a standard assumption in such problems, meaning we are comparing systems with similar viewing angles.\n    \n    With these parameters being the same for both systems, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods:** From the proportionality, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. We rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    \n    Now, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644324937181059\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.36. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the previous calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 is calculated as:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx 0.3644 $$\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
