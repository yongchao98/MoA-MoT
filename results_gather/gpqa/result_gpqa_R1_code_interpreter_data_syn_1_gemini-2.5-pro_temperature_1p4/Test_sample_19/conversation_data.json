    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that together constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**Analysis of the Impulse Approximation:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is used to describe high-energy scattering from a bound system (like a nucleus). The core idea is that the interaction with a single constituent (a nucleon) happens so quickly (is an \"impulse\") that the other parts of the system are spectators. During this brief interaction, the target nucleon can be treated as if it were a free particle, momentarily ignoring the forces that bind it to the nucleus.\n\nLet's break down each assumption in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is a foundational requirement. If the interaction could involve multiple nucleons at once (e.g., through meson-exchange currents), we wouldn't be able to simplify the problem to a single nucleon interaction. The impulse approximation fundamentally assumes the probe hits just *one* nucleon. This is known as the \"one-body current\" assumption and is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. If the incoming probe interacts with other nucleons on its way in, or if the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) interact with the remaining nucleus on their way out (Final State Interactions, FSI), the simple picture breaks down. The energy and momentum of the final state would be altered, and the process couldn't be described as a simple quasi-free event. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we ignore these initial and final state interactions. This is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This assumption describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the nuclear medium. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle being struck. Whether its internal constituents (quarks) are relativistic or not is a separate physical question, relevant for calculating nucleon form factors, but it is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be used with both relativistic and non-relativistic models of the nucleon. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid that the binding potential of the nucleus doesn't have time to act during the collision. The nucleon is hit so hard and fast that it is ejected from the nucleus before it can significantly interact with the other nucleons via the nuclear force. This allows us to treat the struck nucleon as a \"free\" particle (with a specific initial momentum) at the moment of interaction. This assumption is absolutely essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   The rest of the nucleus is a spectator and does not interfere before or after the collision (Assumption 2).\n*   The binding force on the nucleon is negligible during the short time of the interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
