    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B.** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Since B is D₂O, G must be a compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. This is typical for deuterated metal hydroxides (like M(OD)ₓ) or hydrates containing D₂O of crystallization.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction.** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"\n        *   **Gas W:** Let's check common gases where total protons equal total neutrons.\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = (2-1) + (2-1) = 2. (Match)\n            *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Protons = 7 + 7 = 14. Neutrons = (14-7) + (14-7) = 14. (Match)\n            *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): Protons = 6 + 8 = 14. Neutrons = (12-6) + (16-8) = 14. (Match)\n            *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): Protons = 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons = 2*(2-1) + (16-8) = 10. (Match)\n        *   Given that D₂O (B) is formed, the presence of deuterium in the reaction is confirmed. Therefore, **W is most likely D₂ gas**. This also aligns with the first clue that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" (Deuterium is a heavier isotope of Hydrogen).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are common in organic chemistry. Their \"very close analogs\" would be the deuterated versions: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and **Sodium Borohydride (NaBD₄)**. These fit the description of containing a heavy isotope.\n        *   Let's test the keto acid reaction. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n        *   **LiAlH₄** is a strong reducing agent and reduces both groups. Ketone → Alcohol (-CH(OH)-), and Carboxylic Acid → Alcohol (-CH₂OH). The product is a diol (containing two alcohol groups), which has **2 oxygen atoms**.\n        *   **NaBH₄** is a milder reducing agent. It reduces ketones but does not reduce carboxylic acids. The product would be a hydroxy-acid, which would still contain the -COOH group, resulting in a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n        *   The clue states the product has 2 oxygen atoms. This definitively points to the stronger reducing agent. Therefore, Substance **X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Reaction Chemistry**\n    *   Let's check if the reaction of X=LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y produces W=D₂ and a precipitate G that gives B=D₂O on heating.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y=D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y, liquid) → 4 D₂ (W, gas) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G, precipitate)\n    *   **Heating G:** 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B) and 2 LiOD → Li₂O + D₂O (B).\n    *   This entire sequence is chemically consistent and all clues are satisfied.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    *   The problem asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are **Lithium (Li)**, **Aluminium (Al)**, and **Hydrogen (H)** (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1  (Lightest)\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 (Heaviest)\n    *   Now, we calculate the cumulative mass from these elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for this calculation.\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Cumulative Mass (H) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The mass number of its main stable isotope is 27.\n          Cumulative Mass (Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Total cumulative mass** = Mass from Hydrogen + Mass from Aluminium = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nI will use a short Python script to formalize and verify the final calculation.\n```python\n# Identify the substance X as LiAlD4 based on the chemical clues.\n# The elements are Hydrogen (as Deuterium), Lithium, and Aluminium.\n\n# Atomic numbers to find the lightest and heaviest elements:\n# Z_H = 1 (Lightest)\n# Z_Li = 3\n# Z_Al = 13 (Heaviest)\n\n# Mass numbers of the isotopes in the molecule LiAlD4:\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminium-27 = 27\n\n# Number of atoms in the formula LiAlD4:\nnum_D_atoms = 4\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of the lightest element's atoms (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\ncumulative_mass_lightest = num_D_atoms * 2\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass of the heaviest element's atoms (Aluminium).\ncumulative_mass_heaviest = num_Al_atoms * 27\n\n# Sum the two cumulative masses.\ntotal_cumulative_mass = cumulative_mass_lightest + cumulative_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(total_cumulative_mass)\n```\n>>>35\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is given as very close to 277 K. Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K ≈ 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O**. The presence of D₂O confirms that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and its Analog:**\n    *   Substance X contains this heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n    *   Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reducing agents in organic synthesis are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs, containing the heavier isotope, are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). So, X is likely one of these.\n    *   The clue about the reaction with a keto acid is key. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and its analog LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid would be reduced to a diol (a molecule with two alcohol, -OH, groups). This product would contain **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   NaBH₄ (and its analog NaBD₄) is a milder reducing agent. It reduces ketones but does not reduce carboxylic acids. The product would be a hydroxy-acid, containing one alcohol group (-OH) and the original carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This product would contain **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The problem states the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. This confirms that the reagent is the stronger one. Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, and its analog is LiAlH₄.\n\n3.  **Verify the Reaction Chemistry:**\n    *   Let's see if the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) makes sense. \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n    *   **Gas W:** Let's check D₂ (Deuterium gas). A Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the description (protons = neutrons).\n    *   **The Reaction:** The violent reaction of a complex hydride like LiAlD₄ is typically with a protic substance like water. Since the system contains deuterium, the most likely liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → 4 D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products LiOD and Al(OD)₃ are lithium deuteroxide and aluminium deuteroxide, which would precipitate from a non-aqueous solvent, or form if D₂O is added in a limited amount. Al(OD)₃ is a solid precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃ (and possibly LiOD)**.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) decompose to form a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). For instance, 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B). This is consistent with the clues.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest elements, we look at their atomic numbers (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1 **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄.\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its most abundant isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Total cumulative mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminium isotopes) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the final calculation step.\n```python\n# Substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Hydrogen (as isotope Deuterium), Lithium, and Aluminium.\n\n# Find the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number (Z).\n# Z(H) = 1  --> Lightest\n# Z(Li) = 3\n# Z(Al) = 13 --> Heaviest\n\n# We need the cumulative atomic masses of these two elements from the formula LiAlD4.\n# We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n# Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (Al) is 27.\n\n# Count the atoms in the formula LiAlD4.\nnum_atoms_lightest_element = 4  # There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\nnum_atoms_heaviest_element = 1  # There is 1 atom of Aluminium.\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass for each.\nmass_from_lightest = num_atoms_lightest_element * 2\nmass_from_heaviest = num_atoms_heaviest_element * 27\n\n# Sum the results.\ntotal_cumulative_mass = mass_from_lightest + mass_from_heaviest\n\nprint(total_cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the detailed reasoning and the consistent output from the code, the cumulative atomic mass is calculated to be 35.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n1.  **Substance X Identification:** The chemical clues point definitively to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n2.  **Constituent Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n3.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n4.  **Mass Calculation:**\n    *   The cumulative mass of the lightest element's atoms (four Deuterium atoms) is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative mass of the heaviest element's atom (one Aluminium atom) is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
