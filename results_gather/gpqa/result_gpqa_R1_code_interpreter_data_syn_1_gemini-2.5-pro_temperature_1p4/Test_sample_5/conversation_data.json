    "This problem requires finding the energy spectrum of a quantum particle in a given two-dimensional potential. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often convenient to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) if the potential simplifies. The conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\nNow, we group the terms with x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential. It is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of two independent potentials, one for each coordinate:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in 2D is:\n(-ħ²/2m)(∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²)ψ(x, y) + V(x, y)ψ(x, y) = Eψ(x, y)\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions (E = E_x + E_y), and the problem reduces to solving two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator problems.\n\n1.  **Motion in the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. The standard 1D harmonic oscillator potential is V(x) = 1/2 mω²x². By comparing these, we find the effective spring constant for the x-motion, k_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-motion is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. For the x-motion, this becomes:\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_x = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m), where n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n2.  **Motion in the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. The effective spring constant for the y-motion is k_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-motion is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m), where n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n3.  **Total Energy:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    We can factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur derived energy spectrum matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
