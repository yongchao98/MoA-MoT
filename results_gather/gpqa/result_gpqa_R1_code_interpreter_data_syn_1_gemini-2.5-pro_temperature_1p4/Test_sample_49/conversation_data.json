    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to find the number of loops (`L`) in a Feynman diagram, given a mathematical expression representing its \"size estimate\". The expression is: `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. The theory is set in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:** I need to find the part of the expression that directly relates to the number of loops. In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations involving loops have very characteristic mathematical features. I'll analyze each part of the expression:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: `alpha` (α, the fine-structure constant) and `g` are coupling constants. Their powers tell us about the number and type of vertices in the diagram. A factor of `α^k g^j` implies there are `k` vertices of one type and `j` vertices of another, for a total of `k+j` vertices. Here, this suggests `3 + 2 = 5` vertices. This is related to the complexity of the diagram but not directly the number of loops.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors. They typically arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, traces of gamma matrices, or other specific calculational rules of the theory. They don't determine the loop number.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of two energy scales (`Q` and `M`). Such terms, often appearing within logarithms like `log(Q^2/M^2)`, are the result of evaluating the loop integrals. They are a consequence of the loop structure, not a direct indicator of the *number* of loops in this standardized format.\n    *   `1/(4pi)^6`: This is the most promising term. Loop calculations in QFT are performed by integrating over all possible four-momenta of the virtual particles running in the loops. When using the standard technique of dimensional regularization in `D` spacetime dimensions, each loop integral measure introduces a factor of `1/(2π)^D`. For convenience and to make the coupling constants dimensionless, this is usually absorbed into a factor of `1/(4π)^(D/2)` per loop.\n\n3.  **Establish the Loop Rule:**\n    *   The problem states we are in **four-dimensional spacetime**, so `D=4`.\n    *   The standard factor contributed by **each loop** in the calculation is `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`.\n    *   Substituting `D=4`, the factor per loop is `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Expression:**\n    *   Let `L` be the number of loops in the diagram.\n    *   The total factor from all loops combined will be `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / ((4π)^2L) = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n    *   The expression given in the problem contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`.\n    *   I can set up an equation by comparing the term from the general rule with the specific term from the problem:\n        `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\n5.  **Solve for L:**\n    *   From the equation above, the exponents must be equal:\n        `2L = 6`\n    *   Solving for `L`:\n        `L = 6 / 2`\n        `L = 3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculation indicates that the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n7.  **Final Check (Cross-Verification):** Does a 3-loop diagram with 5 vertices (as suggested by the `alpha^3 * g^2` term) make sense? There is a topological formula for connected Feynman diagrams: `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is loops, `I` is internal lines (propagators), and `V` is vertices.\n    *   Plugging in `L=3` and `V=5`:\n    *   `3 = I - 5 + 1`\n    *   `3 = I - 4`\n    *   `I = 7`\n    A diagram with 3 loops, 5 vertices, and 7 internal lines is topologically possible in many QFTs. The pieces of information are consistent with each other. The most direct and reliable indicator, however, remains the power of `(4π)`.\n\nThis confirms the result. The answer is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
