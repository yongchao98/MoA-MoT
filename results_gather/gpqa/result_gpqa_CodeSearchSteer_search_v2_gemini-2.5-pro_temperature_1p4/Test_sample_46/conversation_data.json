    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for the degree of unsaturation is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C = 9, H = 11, N = 1, O = 2 (Oxygen does not affect the calculation).\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond, likely a carbonyl group).\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the N-H stretching of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**, likely an **ester**, as it falls in the typical range for esters (1750-1735 cm-1), especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring which can lower the frequency.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The triplet with an integration of 3H suggests a **methyl group (-CH3)** adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is a classic ethyl group pattern.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** The broad singlet integrating to 2H is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)** attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange. The chemical shift is in the expected region for anilines.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The quartet with an integration of 2H suggests a **methylene group (-CH2-)** adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3 or -C(=O)-CH2-CH3)**. Given the chemical shift of 4.5 ppm, the methylene group is likely attached to an oxygen atom (ester or ether), which is deshielding.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are characteristic of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm suggests it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the carbonyl of the ester), while the upfield shift of the doublet at 7.0 ppm suggests it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n4.  **Putting it all together (Structure Elucidation):**\n    *   From the DoU, we have a benzene ring and a C=O double bond.\n    *   From the IR, we have a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   From the 1H NMR, we have an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a para-substituted benzene ring, and a primary amine group.\n    *   The ethyl group is part of an ester (-O-CH2-CH3) due to the 4.5 ppm chemical shift of the methylene protons.\n    *   The primary amine and the ester group are attached to the benzene ring in a para-position. This is confirmed by the two doublets in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group and an ethyl ester group. This is consistent with all the spectral data. The -NH2 group gives the IR bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The ethyl ester gives the IR band at 1720 cm-1, the quartet at 4.5 ppm and the triplet at 1.20 ppm. The para-substituted ring gives the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester where the carbonyl is attached to the ethyl group and the oxygen is attached to the phenyl ring. The chemical shift of the -CH2- group in the propionate would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide. While it has an ethoxy group and a para-substituted ring, the IR for the amide N-H would typically be a single peak, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1). Also, the formamide proton (-CHO) would give a distinct signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. The two IR bands suggest a primary amine, not a secondary amide.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted benzamide. The substitution pattern would lead to a more complex splitting in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets. Also, it's a primary amide, so the IR would show N-H stretches, but the arrangement doesn't fit the rest of the data as well as A. It has an ethoxy group, not an ethyl ester directly on the ring. The protons of the -OCH2CH3 group would be around 4.0-4.2 ppm.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
