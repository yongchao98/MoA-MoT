    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE_state), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nTo find the partition function, we must sum over all possible configurations of the three spins. Since each of the three spins can take two values (+1 or -1), there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible states for the system.\n\nWe can calculate the energy for each of these 8 states:\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There are 2 states that have an energy of -3J.\n\n2.  **Two spins are +1 and one spin is -1:**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1\n        E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1\n        E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    There are 3 states that have an energy of J.\n\n3.  **One spin is +1 and two spins are -1:**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1\n        E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    There are 3 states that also have an energy of J.\n\nIn summary, we have two distinct energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with that energy):\n*   Energy E1 = -3J, with degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J, with degeneracy g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function Z by summing the term exp(-βE) for each state:\nZ = (number of states with E1) * exp(-βE1) + (number of states with E2) * exp(-βE2)\nZ = g1 * exp(-β(-3J)) + g2 * exp(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
