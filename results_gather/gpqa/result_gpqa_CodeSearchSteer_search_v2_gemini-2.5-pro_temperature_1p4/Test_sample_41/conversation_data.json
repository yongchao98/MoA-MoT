    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The formula for equilibrium temperature (T_eq) involves the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (d). Multiple sources show that the power absorbed by the planet is proportional to (1-A)/d². The power radiated by the planet is proportional to T_eq⁴. Equating these gives:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / d²\n    Since the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets, (1-A) is a constant factor. Therefore:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/d²\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1 / d^(1/2)\n    This confirms that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Consequently, the orbital distance `d` is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    d ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance (d).\n    P² ∝ d³\n    Or, P ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Combining the relationships:** Now I can substitute the expression for `d` from the temperature relationship into Kepler's Third Law.\n    P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n    This means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the periods of two planets is the inverse cube of the ratio of their temperatures:\n    P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)³\n\n4.  **Calculations:**\n    The given temperature ratios are:\n    *   T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3\n\n    First, I will find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet3:\n    T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3)\n    T1 / T3 ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n    Now, I will use this to find the ratio of the orbital periods between Planet3 and Planet1:\n    P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)³\n    P3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)³\n    P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\n    Rounding this to one decimal place gives approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the TTV method and the planet masses is not needed for this calculation. The albedo being constant is a necessary condition for the simple relationship between temperature and distance to hold.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\nThe calculation is sound and confirmed by the physical principles found in the search results. I am ready to give the final answer.\nTo find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we must first establish the relationship between a planet's orbital period (P), its equilibrium temperature (T_eq), and its distance from the star (d).\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula shows that the temperature is related to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (d) from the star, assuming the planet's albedo and the star's luminosity are constant.\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √d\n    This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    *   d ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n2.  **Orbital Period and Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law):** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis, which is the orbital distance (d) for a circular orbit.\n    *   P² ∝ d³\n    Therefore, the period is proportional to the distance to the power of 3/2:\n    *   P ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships:** By substituting the relationship for distance (d) from the temperature equation into Kepler's law, we can find the direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature.\n    *   P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n    *   P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n    This shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculation:** We need to find the ratio P3 / P1. Using the relationship derived above:\n    *   P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios between adjacent planets:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\n    To find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3, we multiply the given ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n    Now, we can calculate the period ratio:\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386\n\nRounding the result, we find that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not required for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
