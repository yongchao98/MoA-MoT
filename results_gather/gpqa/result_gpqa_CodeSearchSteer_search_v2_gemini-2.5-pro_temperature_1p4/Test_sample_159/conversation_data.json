    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity of the diffraction pattern is related to the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁. The minima of the intensity pattern occur at the zeros of this Bessel function. The angular position (θ) of these minima is given by the formula:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ) = zeros of J₁(x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ = zeros of J₁(x)`\n\n`θ = (zeros of J₁(x)) * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nThe first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   First zero (for the first minimum, θ₁): 3.8317\n*   Second zero (for the second minimum, θ₂): 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    This is often approximated as `0.610 * λ / a`. This value corresponds to the more common formula for the first minimum, `θ = 1.22 * λ / d`, where `d=2a` is the diameter.\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n    This corresponds to the formula `θ ≈ 2.23 * λ / d`.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n\n`Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a`\n`Δθ = 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\nThis value is approximately `0.506 * λ / a`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
