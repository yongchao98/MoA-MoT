    "The search results confirm the physical principles used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The planetary equilibrium temperature is the theoretical temperature a planet would have if it were a black body heated only by its star. The formula involves the star's temperature and radius, the planet's distance, and its albedo. For a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature, T_eq, is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (a), as T_eq ∝ (1/a)¹/². This relationship is derived from the balance between the energy absorbed by the planet and the energy it radiates.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as P² ∝ a³, which means the semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3 (a ∝ P²/³).\n\nBased on this, the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period can be established. Since T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/² and a ∝ P²/³, it follows that T_eq ∝ (P²/³)⁻¹/² = P⁻¹/³.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2), we can use the ratio of their orbital periods (P₄ / P₂):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹/³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\nLet's calculate the final ratio:\nP₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4/7)¹/³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
