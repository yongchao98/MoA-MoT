    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must analyze the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands under the hypothetical condition.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **The Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the primary energy source in the Sun and has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III).\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** Produces low-energy *pp* neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 420 keV (0.42 MeV). These are outside the energy bands in question.\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** Features the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). This reaction produces monoenergetic neutrinos at two specific energies: a major line at 861 keV (0.861 MeV) and a minor one at 383 keV. The 861 keV line is a key contributor to the second energy band.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** Involves the beta decay of Boron-8 (`8B`). This creates a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, with energies up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to both energy bands being considered.\n\n2.  **The CNO Cycle:** This cycle, which contributes about 1% of the Sun's energy, also produces neutrinos. The most relevant are from the decays of Nitrogen-13 (`13N`) and Oxygen-15 (`15O`), which have continuous energy spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### Analyzing the Fluxes Under the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**. This means the production of `8B` neutrinos has ceased. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\nLet's examine the remaining neutrino sources in each energy band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The `8B` neutrinos, which previously contributed to this band, are now gone.\n    *   The `7Be` line is at a higher energy (861 keV), and the *pp* neutrinos are at much lower energies.\n    *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the high-energy tail of the continuous spectra from the CNO cycle (`13N` and `15O` decays).\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The contribution from the continuous `8B` spectrum is gone.\n    *   However, the prominent `7Be` neutrino line at 861 keV, which comes from the still-active pp-II branch, falls squarely within this band.\n    *   The CNO cycle neutrinos also contribute a small amount of flux in this range.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: **Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV)**.\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   The numerator is the relatively small flux from the tail end of the CNO neutrino spectra.\n*   The denominator is dominated by the very large and concentrated flux from the `7Be` monoenergetic line, plus a small contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\nThe total flux of `7Be` neutrinos is on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second, whereas the total fluxes for `13N` and `15O` neutrinos are each on the order of 10⁸. Not only is the total `7Be` flux more than an order of magnitude larger, but it is also concentrated in a single energy line, whereas the CNO flux is spread out over a wide energy range.\n\nTherefore, the flux in Band 1 (from CNO only) is very small compared to the flux in Band 2 (dominated by `7Be`). The ratio of a small continuum flux to a very large line flux will be a very small number. A quantitative comparison of the flux densities from the Standard Solar Model shows that the `7Be` line flux is about two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100) greater than the CNO continuum flux in the adjacent 700-800 keV band.\n\nThis leads to a ratio of approximately 1 / 100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
