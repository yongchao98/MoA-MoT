    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    This reaction is the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is brominated at the alpha-position.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid) to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sɴ2). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion from ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    This is a multi-step, one-pot synthesis known as a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   **a.** Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming an enolate.\n    *   **b.** The resulting enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sɴ2 reaction, forming a mono-alkylated intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    *   **c.** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    *   **d.** This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sɴ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of final product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted on a single carbon (C1) with both a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of this molecule to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1) and its substituents (-CN and -COOEt), and the opposite carbon in the ring (C4). This symmetry has the following consequences for the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH₂) group are also equivalent due to the molecular plane of symmetry and free rotation. They are not diastereotopic. This gives a **second signal**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    Due to the plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are equivalent to those on the other side (C2 is equivalent to C6; C3 is equivalent to C5). However, in the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring, the axial and equatorial protons on any given carbon are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic) and are therefore not equivalent.\n    3.  **C2 and C6 Protons:** The two axial protons (on C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. But the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This results in **two signals**.\n    4.  **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the axial protons at these positions give one signal, and the equatorial protons give another. This results in another **two signals**.\n    5.  **C4 Protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by this symmetry element. They are diastereotopic with respect to the substituents on C1 and thus are chemically distinct. This results in **two signals**.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n*   Ethyl -CH₃: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -CH₂: 1 signal\n*   C2/C6 protons: 2 signals (axial and equatorial)\n*   C3/C5 protons: 2 signals (axial and equatorial)\n*   C4 protons: 2 signals (axial and equatorial)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
