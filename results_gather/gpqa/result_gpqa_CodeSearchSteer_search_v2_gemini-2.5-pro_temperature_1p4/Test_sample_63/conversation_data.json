    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gas Absorption/Reaction Data\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of H₂O.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight of this tube did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms reacted = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted with the hot copper must be a nitrogen oxide, since it contains oxygen and is not acidic. Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a likely candidate, as it reacts with hot copper according to the equation: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. Based on this reaction, 0.05 moles of O atoms would come from 0.05 moles of N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 liters of gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas must be inert to all the reagents used. Nitrogen (N₂) fits this description.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n### 2. Determine the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts was composed of water (H₂O), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol (from Tube №1).\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol (from Tube №3). This reaction, N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO, would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n*   The final 0.1 mol of N₂ (Gas C) consists of any N₂ produced directly from the salt decomposition *plus* the N₂ produced from the reaction in Tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.1 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Initial N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n\nTherefore, the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.2 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states that an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, was heated. Let's assume `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B were used. The decomposition reactions for common ammonium salts fit the products we've identified:\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** decomposes upon heating to produce nitrous oxide and water:\n    *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** decomposes upon heating to produce nitrogen gas and water:\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches our findings. If we decompose `n` moles of each:\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n\nTotal products would be: `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O.\nComparing this to our calculated product amounts:\n*   `n` (moles of N₂O) = 0.05 mol\n*   `n` (moles of N₂) = 0.05 mol\n*   `4n` (moles of H₂O) = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\n\nThis is a perfect match. Thus, the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**, and `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\n### 4. Verify the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 moles of each salt adds up to the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g.\n\nThis confirms our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.**\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
