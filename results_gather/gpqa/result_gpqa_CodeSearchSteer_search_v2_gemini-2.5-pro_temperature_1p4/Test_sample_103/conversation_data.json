    "The user's question can be solved by applying the formula for the radial velocity (RV) method. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method:** The radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the host star's spectral lines. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. The amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, known as K.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   For planet #1, the wavelength shift is up to 5 mÅ.\n    *   For planet #2, the wavelength shift is 7 mÅ.\n    *   Since the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift, we can establish the ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n3.  **The RV Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Identify Key Terms:** The term *mₚ sin(i)* is known as the \"minimum mass\" because the inclination *i* is often unknown, and the RV method can only determine this product. The problem states the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this is most reasonably interpreted as the measurable quantity, *mₚ sin(i)*, being similar for both planets.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratios:** We need to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁). Let's rearrange the formula to solve for P:\n\n    *   First, cube both sides: K³ ≈ (2πG / P) * (mₚ sin(i))³ / Mₛ²\n    *   Then, solve for P: P ≈ (2πG * (mₚ sin(i))³) / (K³ * Mₛ²)\n\n    Now, we can create the ratio for our two planetary systems:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ = [ (2πG * (mₚ₂ sin(i₂))³) / (K₂³ * Mₛ₂²) ] / [ (2πG * (mₚ₁ sin(i₁))³) / (K₁³ * Mₛ₁²) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify Using Given Information:**\n    *   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂. This makes the stellar mass term (Mₛ₁ / Mₛ₂) cancel out.\n    *   The planets have similar \"masses\" (interpreted as minimum mass): mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂). This makes the planetary mass term (mₚ₂ sin(i₂) / mₚ₁ sin(i₁)) approximately equal to 1.\n\n    The simplified equation becomes:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value matches option D. A larger induced velocity shift in the star implies a stronger gravitational pull from the planet, which for a given mass, means a shorter orbital period.\n\n<<<D>>>"
