    "### Calculation of the Minimum Energy of the System\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. This can be separated into two components:\n1.  The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center_sphere`).\n2.  The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_sphere_sphere`).\n\nThe total minimum energy is `U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`.\n\n#### Constants and Values\nFirst, we establish the values for the physical constants and given parameters:\n*   Elementary charge (`e`): 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (exact value from CODATA 2018).\n*   Charge of each particle (`q`): `2e = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`.\n*   Coulomb's constant (`k`): 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C².\n*   Distance of the 12 particles from point P (`r`): 2 m.\n\n#### 1. Energy between Central Charge and Sphere Charges (`U_center_sphere`)\nThere are 12 pairs of interactions, each between the central charge `q` and one of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere. The distance for each interaction is `r = 2 m`.\n\nThe energy for one such pair is `k * q² / r`.\nTherefore, the total energy for these 12 pairs is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (8.9875517923 × 10⁹ * (3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹)² / 2)`\n`U_center_sphere = 6 * (9.22899 × 10⁻²⁸) J`\n`U_center_sphere = 5.537394 × 10⁻²⁷ J`\n\n#### 2. Energy among the 12 Charges on the Sphere (`U_sphere_sphere`)\nTo achieve minimum energy, the 12 identical charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is a classic problem in physics known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies for all 66 pairs of charges on the icosahedron.\n`U_sphere_sphere = k * q² * Σ (1 / d_ij)`, where the sum is over the 66 unique pairs of vertices and `d_ij` is the distance between them.\n\nThis can be calculated as `U_sphere_sphere = (k * q² / r) * E₁₂`, where `E₁₂` is the dimensionless sum of reciprocal distances for an icosahedron inscribed in a unit sphere. The value for `E₁₂` is known to be approximately 49.165251.\n\n`U_sphere_sphere = (9.22899 × 10⁻²⁸ / 2) * 49.165251`\n`U_sphere_sphere = (4.614495 × 10⁻²⁸) * 49.165251 J`\n`U_sphere_sphere = 2.269648 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n#### 3. Total Minimum Energy\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = 5.537394 × 10⁻²⁷ J + 2.269648 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n`U_total = 0.5537394 × 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.269648 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n`U_total = 2.823387 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis result, when rounded to three decimal places, is `2.823 x 10⁻²⁶ J`. This value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference can be attributed to slight variations in the physical constants used in the problem's formulation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe calculated minimum energy is approximately `2.823 x 10⁻²⁶ J`, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
