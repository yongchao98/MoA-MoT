    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When the positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero in a static situation. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field, combined with the field from the charge `+q`, results in a net zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity but within the conductor. This effect is known as electrostatic shielding. It means that the charge distribution on the outer surface is unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total enclosed charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the conductor behaves as if a point charge `+q` were located at its center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
