    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the comoving distance of the quasar.\n\n### 1. Identify the Spectral Feature and Calculate Redshift\n\nThe prominent peak observed at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. This sharp drop, known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, is due to the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at wavelengths shorter than the quasar's own Lyα line.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 angstroms). The redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n*   *1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest*\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*   *1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497*\n*   *z ≈ 5.5*\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nThe comoving distance is a measure of distance that accounts for the expansion of the universe. To calculate it, we use the parameters from the Lambda-CDM model provided:\n\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter Density Parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n*   **Redshift (z):** 5.5\n\nUsing a standard cosmology calculator with these parameters, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8 Gpc. For a flat universe, the comoving distance is the same as the comoving radial distance. The calculation can be performed using various online tools or libraries like Astropy in Python. For instance, inputting these values into Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator yields a comoving radial distance of about 8000 Mpc, which is equivalent to 8 Gpc.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculated redshift of approximately 5.5 and the given cosmological parameters, the comoving distance to the quasar is about 8 Gpc. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
