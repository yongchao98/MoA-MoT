    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity. When an electron and a positron annihilate each other, their total energy and momentum before the collision must be equal to the total energy and momentum of the photons produced after the collision.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial total energy:**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Total initial energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy of the resulting photons:**\n    The problem states that two photons of equal energy are produced. According to the conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (E_γ).\n    *   E_initial = 2 * E_γ\n    *   6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\n    *   E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial total momentum:**\n    The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = γmv. The velocity 'v' can be found from the Lorentz factor using the relation v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).\n    *   Velocity of the electron (v_e) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4²) = c * sqrt(15)/4\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = γ_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15) * m_e * c (moving from the left, so positive momentum)\n    *   Velocity of the positron (v_p) = -c * sqrt(1 - 1/2²) = -c * sqrt(3)/2 (moving from the right, so negative momentum)\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = γ_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c\n    *   Total initial momentum (p_initial) is along the horizontal axis and is the sum of the individual momenta: p_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c\n\n4.  **Apply momentum conservation for the photons:**\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by |p_γ| = E_γ / c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c\n    *   The initial momentum is purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The total final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum: p_final = |p_γ|*cos(θ) + |p_γ|*cos(-θ) = 2 * |p_γ| * cos(θ).\n\n5.  **Solve for the angle:**\n    By equating the initial and final momentum:\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n    *   The total angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
