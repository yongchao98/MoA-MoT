    "To determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the quantum states of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle for the four spin-1/2 fermions.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L', the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number 'n' and the spin magnetic quantum number 'm_s' (+1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### System Energy Calculation\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four fermions.\n*   **Level n=1:** This level can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** The remaining two particles will occupy the next lowest energy level, n=2. Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   **Level n=1:** Remains filled with two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now contains only one particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** Contains the promoted particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the different possibilities for exciting the system from the ground state:\n1.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n2.  Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lower energy is 18E. Thus, the energy of the second excited state is:\nE_second = **18E**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
