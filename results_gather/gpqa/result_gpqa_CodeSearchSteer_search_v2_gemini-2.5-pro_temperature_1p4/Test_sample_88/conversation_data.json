    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). While adamantane is resistant to reactions that would violate Bredt's rule (formation of a bridgehead double bond), these harsh conditions can lead to rearrangements. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes is known to produce rearranged products. The provided analytical data for Product 1 (IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, ¹H NMR with 14 protons) strongly suggests the formation of a ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The most plausible structure for Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one**, a known product from the rearrangement of adamantane derivatives under such conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene. Therefore, the reaction in this step is likely a sequence of:\n1.  Reduction of the ketone (protoadamantan-4-one) to an alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol).\n2.  Dehydration (elimination of water) of the alcohol to form an alkene.\n\nThe resulting alkene, Product 2, is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by dimethyl sulfide, DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond and, with a reductive workup (DMS), replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene is a known reaction that yields **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule has a bicyclic structure containing two six-membered rings and two ketone groups at the 3rd and 7th positions.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nWe need to determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Structure and Protons:** The molecule has several types of protons: those on the methylene groups alpha to the ketones (C2, C4, C6, C8), the methylene group at the C9 bridge, and the two bridgehead protons (C1, C5).\n*   **Chemical Shift:** Protons that are alpha to a carbonyl group are deshielded. However, the bridgehead protons at C1 and C5 are beta to *two* carbonyl groups, making them the most deshielded protons in the molecule. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling:** Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C1 (H1). It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   H1 is coupled to four protons on the alpha-carbons (two on C2 and two on C8).\n    *   Due to the molecule's structure, the four vicinal coupling constants between H1 and the four alpha-protons are very similar in magnitude.\n    *   When a proton couples to 'n' other equivalent or nearly equivalent protons, its signal is split into (n+1) lines.\n\nIn this case, H1 couples to four magnetically similar protons (2 on C2 and 2 on C8). Therefore, n=4, and the signal for H1 is split into a (4+1) = 5-line pattern. This pattern is called a **pentet** (or quintet). While long-range coupling to the C9 protons exists, it typically results in broadening of the peaks rather than further distinct splitting. Experimental spectra of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione confirm that the bridgehead proton signal appears as a pentet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
