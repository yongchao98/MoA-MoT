    "A systematic analysis of the provided spectral data leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32%. This M+2 peak with a relative intensity of approximately one-third of the molecular ion peak is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is a distinctive feature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This strong, sharp peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically that of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde, and D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an ester/acid chloride and lacks an O-H group. Phenyl chloroformate would show a C=O stretch but no broad O-H peak. This narrows the possibilities to 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This downfield singlet, integrating to one proton, is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its significant deshielding is due to the electronegative oxygens, and it typically does not couple with other protons.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm).\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n    *   The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring results in two sets of equivalent protons, leading to this simplified \"two-doublet\" pattern.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has a *para* substitution pattern that perfectly matches the observed NMR data. In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has an *ortho* substitution, which would result in four distinct signals for the aromatic protons, creating a much more complex splitting pattern.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy integrating all the spectral data, the evidence points conclusively to one structure:\n*   **MS** indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and establishes a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
