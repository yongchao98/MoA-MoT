    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (specifically 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that has formed a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption peak between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the four isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1 rule\" states that a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by n adjacent, equivalent protons. When a proton is adjacent to multiple, *non-equivalent* sets of protons, it results in more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the **triplet**)\n    *   A -CH₃ group (causes the **quartet**)\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the first **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different -CH₂- group (causes the second **triplet**)\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Structure\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments for each option to see which one matches *both* described splitting patterns. The protons on the main carbon chain (methine protons, -CH-) will show the most complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure has a proton that would be split by another single proton and two different -CH₂- groups, producing a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   However, it lacks a proton that is adjacent to a single proton, a -CH₂- group, AND a -CH₃ group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's number the main chain starting from the -COOH group:\n`HOOC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(4)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(5)H₃`\n*   **H-3:** This proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group at C2 (2 neighbors → triplet), the proton at C4 (1 neighbor → doublet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n*   **H-4:** This proton is adjacent to the proton at C3 (1 neighbor → doublet), the -CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors → quartet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (the order might vary depending on coupling constants, but the multiplicities are correct). This matches the first signal described.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure contains a proton that would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, it does not contain any proton that is adjacent to one proton and two different -CH₂- groups. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The methine protons in this molecule do not have the correct neighbors to produce either a `dtq` or a `dtt` pattern according to the n+1 rule. For example, the proton at C3 is coupled to a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and a -CH₃ group, which would result in a triplet of doublets of quartets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure B, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains protons that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
