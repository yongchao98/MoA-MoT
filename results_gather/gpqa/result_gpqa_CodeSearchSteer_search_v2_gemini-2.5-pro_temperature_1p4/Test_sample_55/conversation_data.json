    "### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\nThe transition of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions follows a specific cascade pathway governed by quantum mechanical selection rules. The |3,0,0⟩ state is commonly known as the 3s state, and the |1,0,0⟩ state is the 1s ground state.\n\n#### Step 1: First Dipole Transition |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) and the magnetic quantum number (m) are:\n*   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n*   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩. Applying the selection rules:\n*   Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number n must decrease. The only energy level with l=1 that lies between n=3 and n=1 is the n=2 level. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the sublevels of the 2p orbital: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n#### Step 2: Second Dipole Transition |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\nThe second transition is from one of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ states to the final |1,0,0⟩ state. Let's check if this is an allowed transition:\n*   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl = ±1 rule.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in the magnetic quantum number is Δm = 0 - 0 = 0, which is allowed.\n\nAll three possible routes (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a specific transition route. This refers to the branching ratio for that particular cascade pathway.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the First Transition:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (3s) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. The probability, or branching ratio, for decaying into any one of these specific states is therefore 1/3.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the Second Transition:** Once the atom is in an n=2, l=1 state (a 2p state), the only lower energy state it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the n=1, l=0 state (1s). There are no other allowed decay paths. Therefore, the probability of the transition from any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the |1,0,0⟩ state is 1.\n\n**Total Probability for a Specific Route:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in option B:\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1\n*   Total Probability = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3\n\nThus, the probability of the specific decay route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3. This reasoning applies equally to the other two possible routes through |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩, each also having a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nB) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 - Correct route and probability.\nC) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 - Incorrect probability.\nD) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 - Incorrect probability.\n\nThe correct transition route and its corresponding probability is given by option B.\n\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<B>>>"
