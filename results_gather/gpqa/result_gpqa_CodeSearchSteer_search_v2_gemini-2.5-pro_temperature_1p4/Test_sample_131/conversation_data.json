    "Here is a systematic analysis of the provided information to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the NMR Data**\n\nThe problem states that a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14 has the following ¹H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with an intensity ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with an intensity ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThis is the spectrum of the *entire mixture*. We need to find two compounds from the list that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce this combined spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four options. All have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, it has two chemically equivalent aromatic protons and four equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry. There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6). There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), the one at position 2 is unique (3H), and the one at position 5 is unique (3H).\n    *   **Spectrum:** Two aromatic singlets (1H each, ratio 1:1) and three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two aromatic protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent (6H).\n    *   **Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and two aliphatic singlets (6H each, ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent. The ethyl groups will show splitting. The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and will appear as a quartet, while the two -CH3- groups are equivalent and will appear as a triplet.\n    *   **Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet, one aliphatic quartet, and one aliphatic triplet. This compound is immediately ruled out because the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum shows 2 aromatic singlets (1:1) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1). Let's see which pair could produce this outcome. The total number of protons for the aliphatic signals (ratio 2+1+1=4 parts) must correspond to the 24 methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture. This means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H. The total for the aromatic signals (ratio 1+1=2 parts) must correspond to the 4 aromatic protons, meaning each signal integrates to 2H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets). This would likely result in three signals unless there is accidental overlap. If the two 1H singlets from isodurene were to overlap, you would have two 2H signals, which matches the 1:1 ratio required.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H singlet, two 3H singlets). This gives five potential signals. To get three signals with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations, you would need two of the 6H signals to overlap (to make the 12H peak) and the two 3H signals to overlap (to make one of the 6H peaks). This combination is plausible but requires multiple accidental overlaps.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out due to the multiplets from 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Isodurene provides two 1H singlets. To get two signals with a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 2H each), the two 1H signals from isodurene must overlap, creating a single 2H peak. This combined peak and the 2H peak from durene give the required 1:1 ratio. This is a very plausible scenario.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Isodurene provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). To get three total signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (12H, 6H, 6H), the two 3H signals from isodurene must overlap to create a single 6H peak. The resulting signals would be the 12H from durene, the 6H from isodurene, and the new 6H peak from the overlapped 3H signals. This combination perfectly matches the observed 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Prehnitene (one 2H singlet). This would produce two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). This combination directly yields three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio. No accidental overlaps are needed for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Revisiting the Prompt & Final Decision**\n\nBoth options C and D seem plausible. However, the scenario described in option D, the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, provides the observed number and ratio of aliphatic signals *without* requiring any accidental chemical shift equivalences in that region.\n\nLet's re-examine option C. It requires the two aromatic protons of Isodurene to become equivalent AND the two non-equivalent 3H methyl groups of Isodurene to become equivalent. While possible, it is less probable than the scenario in D.\n\nLet's re-examine option D.\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet from Durene and one 2H singlet from Prehnitene. As long as their chemical environments are slightly different, this will result in two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H or 1:1). This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** One 12H singlet from Durene and two 6H singlets from Prehnitene. This directly results in three singlets with a 12H:6H:6H or 2:1:1 integration ratio, provided they have different chemical shifts.\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D) provides the most direct and logical explanation for the observed spectrum, requiring fewer instances of coincidental signal overlap compared to Option C.\n\n<<<D>>>"
