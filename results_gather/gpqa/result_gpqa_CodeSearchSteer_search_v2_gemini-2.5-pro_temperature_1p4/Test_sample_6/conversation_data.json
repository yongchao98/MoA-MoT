    "The search results confirm the physics and the calculation performed.\n\n1.  **Threshold Condition Derivation**: The process is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. As confirmed by multiple physics resources (e.g.,), the threshold energy calculation involves considering the invariant mass of the system. The minimum energy required in the center-of-mass frame is the rest mass of the products, which is $2m_e c^2$. By setting the square of the center-of-mass energy, $s$, to be equal to $(2m_e c^2)^2$, we can find the threshold. In the lab frame, for a head-on collision between a high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$) and a target photon ($E_{CMB}$), this invariant mass squared is $s = 4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$. Equating the two gives the threshold condition: $4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$, which simplifies to $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$. My initial derivation was correct.\n\n2.  **Values for Constants**:\n    *   **Electron Rest Mass ($m_e c^2$)**: The problem requires the rest mass energy of an electron. This is a fundamental constant. Search results provide a precise value of 0.511 MeV or 0.511 x 10^6 eV.\n    *   **Average CMB Photon Energy ($E_{CMB}$)**: The problem statement gives this value as $10^{-3}$ eV. Search results show that the average energy of a CMB photon today is around $6.34 \\times 10^{-4}$ eV. However, for the purpose of answering the multiple-choice question, it is standard practice to use the values provided in the problem statement. The value $10^{-3}$ eV is a commonly used approximation for this kind of problem.\n\n3.  **Calculation Confirmation**:\n    *   $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n4.  **Unit Conversion to GeV**:\n    *   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated value, $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV, is extremely close to option A, which is $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This confirms that the initial reasoning and calculation were correct and lead directly to one of the provided answers. The interaction of high-energy photons with the CMB is a well-known process that limits the mean free path of very-high-energy gamma rays in the universe.\n\nThe question asks for the energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes would be \"limited by this process\". This implies finding the threshold energy above which this interaction becomes possible and increasingly probable, thereby reducing the distance such a gamma-ray can travel. The calculation provides this exact threshold.\n\nThe final answer is derived from first principles of physics and confirmed by the provided options. I am ready to give the final answer.To solve this problem, we need to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) to produce an electron-positron pair when colliding with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($E_{CMB}$). The reaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThe threshold condition for this reaction occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$, and for a positron, it is the same. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the center-of-mass frame is $2m_e c^2$.\n\nWe can relate the lab frame energies to the center-of-mass energy using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$, which is the square of the total four-momentum.\n\n1.  **In the Center-of-Mass Frame (at threshold):**\n    The total energy is $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero. Thus, the invariant mass squared is $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n2.  **In the Lab Frame:**\n    Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_\\gamma$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. To find the minimum threshold for $E_\\gamma$, we must consider the most efficient collision, which is a head-on collision.\n    The invariant mass squared is $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    For photons, the rest mass is zero, so $p^2 = 0$. This simplifies the expression to $s = 2p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    The four-momentum dot product is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. For a head-on collision, the angle between the momenta is 180Â°, so $\\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos(180^\\circ) = -E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$ (since for photons, $|\\vec{p}| = E$).\n    Therefore, $s = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - (-E_\\gamma E_{CMB})) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n3.  **Equating and Solving for Threshold Energy:**\n    We set the invariant mass squared from both frames equal to each other:\n    $4E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    This gives the threshold energy for the gamma-ray:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    We are given the necessary values:\n    *   Average photon energy of the CMB, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a known physical constant, approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV}$ or $0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n    $E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n5.  **Convert to GeV:**\n    Since the options are in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
