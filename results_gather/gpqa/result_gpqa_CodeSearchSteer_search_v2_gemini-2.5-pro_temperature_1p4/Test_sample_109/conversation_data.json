    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider the criteria for observation at both facilities: the star's brightness (apparent V magnitude) and its position in the sky (declination).\n\n**1. Brightness Criteria**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17 mag).\n*   **HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16 mag).\n\nFor a star to be observable by both instruments, it must meet the stricter of the two brightness limits. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 (V < 16).\n\n**2. Visibility (Declination) Criteria**\n\nEven though the prompt asks to disregard pointing limits, the fundamental limitation of which parts of the sky are visible from each hemisphere must be considered for a realistic assessment.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. This allows it to observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and parts of the northern, roughly up to a declination of +65°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of about +19.8° N. This allows it to observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and parts of the southern, down to a declination of roughly -70°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be within the range visible to both, which is approximately between -70° and +65°.\n\n**3. Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nThe relationship between a star's apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and extinction (A) is given by the formula:  \nm = M + 5 * log₁₀(d / 10 pc) + A.\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** M_V = 15.5, d = 10 pc, A_V = 0.  \n        m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) + 0 = 15.5 mag.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 15.5 is < 16, so it is bright enough.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** DEC = -75°. This is south of the -70° limit for Keck Observatory.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not visible from Keck. **Cannot be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Given as 16.5 mag.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 16.5 is *not* < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not bright enough for HIRES. **Cannot be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Given as 15.5 mag. The additional information about color excess is not needed to determine the observed magnitude.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 15.5 is < 16, so it is bright enough.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** DEC = +48°. This is between -70° and +65°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Bright enough and visible from both observatories. **Can be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** M_V = 15.5, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4.  \n        First, calculate extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.  \n        m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 16.74 is *not* < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not bright enough for HIRES. **Cannot be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** M_V = 16.5, d = 5 pc, A_V = 0.  \n        m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 15.0 mag.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 15.0 is < 16, so it is bright enough.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** DEC = +60°. This is between -70° and +65°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Bright enough and visible from both observatories. **Can be observed by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the brightness and visibility criteria for both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
