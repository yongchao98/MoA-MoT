    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we will use the fundamental laws of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the luminosity (L) of a star, which is the total energy it radiates per second, is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. It states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n    *   λ_max * T = b\n    *   where b is Wien's constant.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times the mass of Star_2 (this information is not needed for this calculation).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Use the Given Radius Ratio:**\nWe are given that R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Squaring this gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\nSo the equation becomes:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\nThe problem states that \"astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a physical property like a star's peak emission wavelength implies that observational effects, such as the Doppler shift from radial velocity, have been corrected for. This means the intrinsic, or rest-frame, peak wavelengths (λ_max) of the two stars are equal.\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_max * T = constant), if the peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂), then their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of their temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1\n\nThe provided radial velocities are considered distractor information, as the phrasing implies that they have already been accounted for in the determination of the peak wavelength.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
