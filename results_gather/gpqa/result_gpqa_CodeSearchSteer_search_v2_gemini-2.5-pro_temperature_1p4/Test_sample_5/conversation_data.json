    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nVᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(z) = 1/2 kₑff z² are given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(kₑff/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ωₓ = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels for the x-oscillator are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\nThe angular frequency is ωᵧ = sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels for the y-oscillator are:\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the independent oscillators.\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2(nₓ + 1/2) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
