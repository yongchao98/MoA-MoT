    "This scenario requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths under identical conditions of gas pressure, temperature, and volume.\n\n*   **λ1: The mean free path of gas molecules.** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. It is determined by the number density of the gas and the kinetic collision cross-section of the molecules themselves.\n\n*   **λ2: The mean free path of electrons.** This is the average distance a high-energy electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. This is determined by the same number density of the gas but a different interaction: the electron-molecule scattering cross-section.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the difference between the collision cross-sections for these two phenomena.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n1.  **Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1):** For a gas molecule, the \"target\" is another gas molecule of a similar physical size. The collision is a \"hard-sphere\" type interaction, and the cross-section (σ_gas-gas) is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2):** For a high-energy (1000 kV) electron, the gas molecule presents a much smaller target. The electron is a point-like particle, and it primarily interacts with the electrostatic fields of the molecule's nucleus and electron cloud. At very high energies, such as 1 MeV, many electrons will pass straight through the relatively diffuse electron cloud of a gas molecule without significant interaction or scattering. This results in a much smaller effective scattering cross-section (σ_electron-gas) compared to the physical collision cross-section between two gas molecules. Research on electron scattering shows that for high energies (well above a few hundred eV), the total scattering cross-section decreases as energy increases.\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, and the conditions (number of gas particles) are identical:\n\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gas-gas.\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_electron-gas.\n\nBecause the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_electron-gas) is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gas-gas), the resulting mean free path for the electrons (λ2) will be significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nTherefore, λ2 is substantially greater than λ1. Reviewing the options, option (D) is the only one that reflects this physical reality, stating that λ2 is not just larger, but significantly larger than λ1 (by at least a factor of 1.22).\n\n<<<D>>>"
