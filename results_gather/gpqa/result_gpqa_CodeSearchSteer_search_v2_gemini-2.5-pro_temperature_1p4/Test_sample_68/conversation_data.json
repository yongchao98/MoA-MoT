    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nFirst, we need to understand the concepts involved:\n*   **Relativistic Effects**: The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime will be longer in the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber) than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n*   **Decay Length**: The distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying follows an exponential decay law. The average distance is called the mean decay length ($L$).\n*   **Observation Condition**: A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle's track length ($l$) is greater than the resolution of the detector ($d_{res}$).\n*   **Probability**: We need to find the resolution that allows for the observation of at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of a particle having a track length greater than the resolution must be at least 0.3.\n\n### 2. Required Formulas\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass ($m_0$).\n    $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2}$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame ($L$)**: The average distance a particle travels before decaying.\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$ is the dilated lifetime.\n    A more convenient formula relates the decay length to the particle's momentum ($p$):\n    $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    The momentum can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$.\n    So, $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2}$.\n    This gives: $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2}}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$.\n\n3.  **Decay Probability**: The probability that a particle will decay after travelling a distance $x$ is described by the exponential decay law. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $d_{res}$ before decaying is:\n    $P(l > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Fraction of decays to observe $\\ge 0.30$\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the momentum term ($pc$).**\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2}$\n$pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \\text{ GeV} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($L$).**\n$L = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$\n$L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution ($d_{res}$).**\nThe fraction of observed decays is $P(l > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$. We need this to be at least 30%.\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d_{res}/L \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res}/L \\le -\\ln(0.30) = \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.30}) \\approx 1.204$\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed, which in this context means the largest possible resolution value that satisfies the condition. Therefore, we solve for the boundary case:\n$d_{res} = L \\times 1.204$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is not one of the options. However, option (B) is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is very close to the calculated value. The discrepancy of about 9% is likely due to a small imprecision in the values given in the problem statement.\n\nLet's check if the resolution from option (B) is sufficient:\n*   If $d_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-d_{res}/L} = e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx e^{-1.10} \\approx 0.33$.\n*   Since 33% is greater than the required 30%, this resolution is sufficient.\n\nOption (D) ($2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m) is also a sufficient resolution (it would observe nearly 100% of decays), but the question asks for the minimum required resolution, which implies finding the resolution at the limit of the condition. Option (B) is the closest to this limit.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
