    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability is given by the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe particle is only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral for the normalization condition will be from 1 to 3.\n\n**1. Determine the Probability Density Function |ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe probability density function is the product of the wave function (ψ) and its complex conjugate (ψ*).\n\nFirst, find the complex conjugate, ψ*, by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, multiply ψ* by ψ:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe integral of the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first part, a² is a constant:\na² * ∫¹³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n\nFor the second part:\n∫¹³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n\nNow evaluate the definite integrals:\na² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] + [0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1] = 1\na² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] + [0.75 - 0.25] = 1\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n**4. Calculate the Value of \"a\"**\n\nNow, solve for a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\nFinally, take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to the option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
