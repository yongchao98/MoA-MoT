    "Based on the chemical properties described, the identity of the substances can be determined, which in turn allows for the calculation of the molecular weight of substance A4.\n\n*   **Identifying Element Y and Substances A1, A2, A3:** The \"bright-red substance\" A1 that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is a classic description of **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. This identifies element **Y** as **Platinum (Pt)**. The decomposition of A1 produces fluorine and A2. PtF₆ decomposes into **Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅)** and fluorine, making **A2 = PtF₅**. A3, which is obtained by fluorinating element Y and also interacts with xenon, can be identified as **Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄)**.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance A4:** The problem states that A5 is formed by adding element Y (Platinum) to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". The platinum fluorides themselves are colored (PtF₆ is dark-red, PtF₄ is red-orange). This suggests A4 is not a binary fluoride of platinum. The fact that A1 and A3 react with xenon introduces xenon compounds as plausible reactants. A key candidate for A4 is **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**. Xenon difluoride is a colorless crystalline solid that can be dissolved to form a colorless solution. It is also a powerful fluorinating agent capable of reacting with platinum metal.\n\n*   **The Reaction and Identifying A5:** The reaction between platinum metal (Y) and a solution of xenon difluoride (A4) in a 1:1 molar ratio would proceed as follows:\n    Pt + XeF₂ → PtF₂ + Xe\n    This reaction is plausible, with platinum being oxidized and xenon being reduced. This identifies substance A5 as **Platinum difluoride (PtF₂)**. The final clue states that A5 decomposes in water. Indeed, platinum(II) fluoride is known to be hydrolyzed by water.\n\n*   **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:** Now that A4 has been identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF₂), its molecular weight can be calculated.\n    *   Atomic weight of Xenon (Xe) ≈ 131.29 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of XeF₂ = 131.29 + (2 × 19.00) = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
