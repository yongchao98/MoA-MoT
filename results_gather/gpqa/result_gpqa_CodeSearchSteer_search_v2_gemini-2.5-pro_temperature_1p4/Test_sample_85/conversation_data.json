    "To determine the correct starting materials, A and B, we must analyze the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and how they interact with the proposed starting material, a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material corresponds to the 4-position in the lactone product.\n\n### Reagent Selectivity\n\n1.  **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It reduces the ester functional group to a primary alcohol.\n2.  **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe proposed starting material is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: `(isobutyl ester)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. It has two functional groups that can be reduced: an ester and a carboxylic acid. The stereochemistry is determined by the chiral center at the ethyl-substituted carbon.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: Compound A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A\n*   **Reagents:** LiBH₄, followed by H⁺ workup\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nSince LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester, the isobutyl ester group will be reduced to a primary alcohol. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n`(isobutyl ester)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --LiBH₄--> HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n\nThe resulting hydroxy acid then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n\nCrucially, neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization affects the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is directly retained in the product. For the product to be `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n#### **Reaction 2: Compound B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B\n*   **Reagents:** BH₃, followed by H⁺ workup\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n`(isobutyl ester)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --BH₃--> (isobutyl ester)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n\nThe resulting hydroxy ester then undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺). The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and eliminating isobutanol.\n\nSimilar to the first reaction, these steps do not alter the existing stereocenter. The stereochemistry of starting material B is retained in the final lactone product. For the product to be `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Compound B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
