  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function reduces resistance, so G1 is a positive contributor to resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function significantly reduces resistance, more so than G1. So, G3 is also a positive and important contributor to resistance.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Epistasis\n\nEpistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. When creating a double mutant, if the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, that gene is said to be epistatic (acting upstream) to the other.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This means the `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). This means the `g2` mutation's effect also masks the `g3` mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of both genes in the resistance pathway. A common role for such an upstream regulator is a **transcription factor** that activates the expression of downstream genes (G1 and G3).\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is different and more severe than both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) single mutants.\n    *   Because the double mutant has a phenotype distinct from either single mutant, there is **no epistasis between G1 and G3**. This rules out the final clauses of options A, B, and D if interpreted strictly.\n    *   The fact that knocking out both genes has a much stronger effect than the sum of the individual effects (loss of 25% from G1 + loss of 50% from G3 would predict 25% remaining resistance, but only 10% remains) suggests a synergistic interaction. This often happens when two genes have partially overlapping or **redundant functions** in the same biological process.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given conclusions based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This is strongly supported by the epistasis data.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a plausible mechanism for how G2 could regulate both, but it cannot be proven from this data alone.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is a good description of their synergistic interaction. Both contribute to resistance, and the loss of both is much more severe, which is a hallmark of a redundant system.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the upstream gene.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: While this part is correct, the first premise is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, Option B contains the most correct statements derived from the experimental data, even though its final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is technically incorrect. The first two statements in Option B are the strongest conclusions from the experiment: G2 acts as an upstream regulator (like a transcription factor), and G1 and G3 have redundant functions. The error in the final clause is likely a flaw in the question's options, but B remains the best choice overall.\n\n<<<B>>>"
