    "In the context of a synthetic organic chemistry lab, when a chemist says their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" they are most likely referring to a failure to separate two or more compounds using chromatography.\n\nThis phrasing is a common way to describe the results of thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a technique used to quickly check the progress of a reaction or the composition of a mixture. In TLC, a mixture is spotted onto a plate coated with a stationary phase, often silica gel. A solvent, known as the mobile phase, then moves up the plate.\n\nSeparation occurs because different compounds travel up the plate at different rates based on their polarity. Less polar compounds move farther up the plate, while more polar compounds stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase and move shorter distances. The result is a series of spots, each corresponding to a different compound.\n\nIf the compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities, they will travel up the TLC plate at nearly the same rate. This results in spots that are very close together or overlap, appearing as if they are \"on top of each other.\" This indicates a poor separation, which is a common problem when trying to purify reaction mixtures containing structurally similar compounds. This same issue can occur on a larger scale during column chromatography, a technique used to purify and isolate the desired product.\n\nBased on this, the other options are less likely:\n*   **Similar boiling points (B)** would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrasing isn't typical for describing a failed distillation.\n*   **Similar optical rotations (C)** are a property of chiral molecules and are measured *after* a compound is purified; this property does not affect the separation process itself.\n*   **Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions (D)** are fundamental forces between all molecules and are part of why chromatography works, not a description of a failed separation technique.\n\n<<<A>>>"
