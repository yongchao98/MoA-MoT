    "### Step-by-Step IUPAC Naming\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has the highest priority among the given substituents. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Identify and Position the Substituents:**\n    *   The problem states a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. Since the -COOH is at C1, the other two groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* to the carboxylic acid, placing it at C4.\n    *   A final constraint is given: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. For the alcohol (-OH, or hydroxyl) and methoxy groups to both be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be positioned between them.\n\n3.  **Determine the Numbering Direction:** We have two possible arrangements that fit the description, depending on the numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise from C1).\n\n    *   **Arrangement A (Clockwise numbering preference):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   *Check constraint:* The methoxy (C4) and alcohol (C2) are both ortho to the nitrile (C3). This arrangement is valid.\n\n    *   **Arrangement C (Counter-clockwise numbering preference):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   *Check constraint:* The methoxy (C4) and alcohol (C6) are both ortho to the nitrile (C5). This arrangement is also valid.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Rules for Lowest Locants:** Since both numbering schemes result in the same set of locant numbers {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use alphabetical order to decide the correct numbering. The IUPAC rule states that if there is a choice, the ring is numbered to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent group cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   Cyano\n    *   Dimethylamino\n    *   Formyl\n    *   Hydroxy\n    *   Methoxy\n\n6.  **Compare the Numbering Schemes:** We compare the locant number assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list.\n    *   In Arrangement A, the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **3**.\n    *   In Arrangement C, the **cyano** group is at position **5**.\n\n    According to IUPAC rules, the lowest number (3) is preferred. Therefore, Arrangement A is the correct structure.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final Name:** List the substituents from Arrangement A in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\n    Combining these gives the final IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. This matches option A. The other options are incorrect because they either violate the numbering rule (Option C) or list the substituents in a non-alphabetical order (Options B and D).\n\n<<<A>>>"
