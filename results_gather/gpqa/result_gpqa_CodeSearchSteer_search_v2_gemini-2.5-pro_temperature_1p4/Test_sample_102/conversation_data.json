    "To determine the most efficient sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nLet's analyze the directing properties of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Deactivating (strongly) and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests a synthesis route where at some stage, two *meta*-directing groups are present on the ring, which will direct the third incoming substituent to the final meta position.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct. The -Br is an o,p-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group directs the nitro group to the para position.\n3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene → Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step is not feasible. The benzene ring is strongly deactivated by both a nitro group and a halogen, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring with any significant yield.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n3.  **Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.**\n4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene:** This step is a deamination reaction that regenerates the starting material, benzene. This entire sequence is unproductive.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** Correct. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. The structure is now correct for a 1,3 relationship.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** At this stage, we have two groups: -COCH3 (*meta*-director) and -Br (*ortho, para*-director). For an incoming electrophile (like NO2+), the -COCH3 directs to position 5, while the -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This is a case of competing directors. Generally, the position ortho to the bromo group and meta to the acetyl group (position 4) or para to the bromo group (position 6) would be favored, leading to a mixture of products, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired 5-nitro isomer. However, of the options provided, this is the only one that is not immediately invalidated by a reaction that cannot proceed. It is possible the question contains a typo and steps (ii) and (iii) should be reversed. If nitration occurred first (giving 3-nitroacetophenone), followed by bromination, both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups would direct the bromine to position 5, giving the desired product in high yield. Given the other options are impossible, this option, despite its flaw in regioselectivity, is the most plausible intended answer. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are irrelevant if the target molecule is formed at step (iii).\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n3.  **Aniline → Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails. Aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a salt. This deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical. Option C, while having a step with poor regioselectivity for a \"high-yield\" synthesis as written, is the only sequence of plausible reactions that could form the product. By elimination, it is the best answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
