    "This reaction is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a very strong base that can remove a proton (or deuteron) from the positions adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom.\n\nThere are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine on C1:\n*   The C2 position, which holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   The C6 position, which holds a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so removing the proton from C6 is faster than removing the deuteron from C2. However, both pathways are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Elimination of HBr:** The amide ion (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the \"triple bond\" between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n2.  **Elimination of DBr:** The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process, yielding a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 2-Deuteriobenzyne (Intermediate 1):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the amide ion attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by ammonia gives **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the amide ion attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by ammonia gives a product with the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this is named **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (Intermediate 2):**\n    *   This non-deuterated benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by the amide ion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn total, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-Deuterioaniline\n2.  3-Deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
