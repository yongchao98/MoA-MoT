    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify Gases B and D, and Solvent H:**\n    *   The fourth clue states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n    *   A well-known industrial reaction between two common gases that forms a solvent is the synthesis of phosgene: **CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g)**.\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is indeed extremely hazardous and can be used as a solvent in certain chemical reactions.\n    *   This gives us a strong hypothesis: {B, D} are {CO, Cl₂} and H is COCl₂.\n\n2.  **Identify Acids F and G:**\n    *   The third clue describes the hydrolysis of product C: C + H₂O → A + F + G.\n    *   This reaction regenerates the starting solid A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   Let's test our hypothesis for B and D. The hydrolysis of C must involve the constituents of B.\n    *   If B = CO, its reaction with water is not straightforward and doesn't typically produce two acids.\n    *   If **B = Cl₂**, its reaction with water is a well-known disproportionation reaction: **Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HOCl**.\n    *   In this reaction, **HCl (hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid (F), and **HOCl (hypochlorous acid)** is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect match for the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify:\n        *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide gas)\n        *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n        *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid)\n        *   **G = HOCl** (hypochlorous acid)\n\n3.  **Identify Products C and E:**\n    *   The first clue states: **A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C (bright red)**.\n    *   The third clue states that C reacts with water to reform A and produce the acids. This implies that C is a complex or adduct of A and Cl₂, which releases the Cl₂ upon contact with water, leading to the hydrolysis described above. So, C can be represented as **A·(Cl₂)₈**. The identity of solid A is not crucial for the final answer, but it could be a substance with a high surface area capable of adsorbing chlorine, like a specific form of activated carbon, which acts as a carrier for the chlorine. The \"bright red\" color is a specific property of this complex.\n    *   The second clue states: **C + 2D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)**.\n    *   Substituting the known substances: **A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → E**.\n    *   This reaction involves carbon monoxide reacting with the chlorine held by substance A. The reaction between CO and Cl₂ produces phosgene (COCl₂). Substance A likely acts as a catalyst.\n    *   The stoichiometry indicates that 2 equivalents of CO react. The standard reaction is CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂. Therefore, 2 molecules of CO will react with 2 molecules of Cl₂ from the complex C to produce 2 molecules of phosgene.\n    *   The problem asks for the identity of product E, which is described as \"extremely hazardous.\" Phosgene fits this description perfectly. The reaction likely produces phosgene as the main hazardous product.\n    *   Thus, **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, which we have identified as phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   The phosgene molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    *   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n        *   It has one C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n        *   It has two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle and is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C₂\nB) D∞h\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂ᵥ\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group for E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
