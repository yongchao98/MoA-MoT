    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy.\n\n### 1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe problem is governed by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The mathematical relation for position and momentum is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nWe are given:\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m\n*   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality in the uncertainty principle:\n\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nΔp_min = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m)\nΔp_min = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n### 3. Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) through the energy-momentum relation. The change in energy can be expressed as:\n\nΔE = |dE/dp| * Δp\n\nWhether using the non-relativistic kinetic energy (E = p²/2m) or the full relativistic energy (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²), the derivative dE/dp simplifies to the particle's velocity, v. A clear derivation shows that **ΔE = v * Δp**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the electron's speed and the calculated minimum uncertainty in its momentum.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Speed of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nΔE_min = v * Δp_min\nΔE_min = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min = 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately **1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J**. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe result most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
