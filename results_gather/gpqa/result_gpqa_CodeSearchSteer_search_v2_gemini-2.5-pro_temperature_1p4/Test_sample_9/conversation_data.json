    "a) **An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes Earth itself. Earth's average density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nb) **A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nc) **A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, density increases with mass due to gravitational compression. A planet that is five times more massive than Earth, but made of the same materials, will be compressed more by its own gravity. This results in a significantly higher density than Earth's 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nd) **A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet less massive than Earth with the same composition will experience less gravitational compression. Therefore, its density will be lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density higher than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
