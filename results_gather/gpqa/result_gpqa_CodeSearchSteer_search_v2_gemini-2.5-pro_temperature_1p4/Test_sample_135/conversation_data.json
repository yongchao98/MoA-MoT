    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field, ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV.\n\nThe vector field is given as f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r is the radial distance from the origin and r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume V is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of f in spherical coordinates for r ≠ 0 yields:\n∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * f_r)/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nIf the divergence were zero everywhere, the volume integral would also be zero. However, the vector field f is singular at the origin (r=0), and the standard formula for divergence doesn't apply there. This singularity is crucial to the problem. The divergence at the origin is undefined or infinite.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the outward flux of the field through the closed surface S that bounds the volume:\n∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n\nBecause the vector field is singular at the origin, we cannot directly apply the theorem to the entire sphere. The correct approach is to exclude the singularity by considering the volume V' between the outer sphere of radius R (S_R) and a small, inner sphere of radius ε (S_ε) centered at the origin. Within this volume V', the divergence is zero, so the volume integral over V' is zero.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem applied to V', the total flux through its boundary (S_R and S_ε) is zero:\n∮∮_S_R (f ⋅ dS) + ∮∮_S_ε (f ⋅ dS) = ∫∫∫_V' (∇ ⋅ f) dV' = 0\n\nNote that the normal vector for the inner surface S_ε points inward (towards the origin) with respect to the volume V'. To have the standard outward-pointing normal from the enclosed volume, we reverse its sign, which leads to:\n∮∮_S_R (f ⋅ dS) = ∮∮_S_ε (f ⋅ dS_outward)\n\nThis shows that the flux through any sphere centered at the origin is the same, regardless of its radius. We can now calculate this flux for a sphere of radius r:\nThe surface element is dS = r² sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂.\nThe vector field on the surface is f = (1/r²) r̂.\nThe flux is:\nFlux = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∬ [(1/r²) r̂] ⋅ [r² sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂]\nFlux = ∬ sin(θ) dθ dφ\nThe integral is taken over the entire surface of the sphere, with θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.\nFlux = ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ * ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [φ] (from 0 to 2π) * [-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π) = (2π) * (-(-1) - (-1)) = 2π * 2 = 4π.\n\nThis result of 4π represents the flux out of the small sphere S_ε. By the Divergence Theorem, this must be equal to the volume integral of the divergence within that small sphere. Since the divergence is zero everywhere outside the origin, the integral over the entire sphere of radius R is equal to the integral over the infinitesimal volume at the origin.\n\nIn the language of distributions, the divergence of this vector field is actually 4π times the Dirac delta function at the origin, ∇ ⋅ (r̂/r²) = 4πδ(r). The volume integral of this over the sphere of radius R is:\n∫∫∫_V 4πδ(r) dV = 4π ∫∫∫_V δ(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
