    "The solution to this problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the organic reactions to identify the final product, followed by the determination of its molecular symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of *o*-nitrotoluene and *p*-nitrotoluene. For the purpose of this multi-step synthesis, we will consider the major, sterically less hindered product, which is *p*-nitrotoluene. Thus, **Product 1 is *p*-nitrotoluene**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene. While there are various possible oxidation products, the most plausible reaction pathway in this context leads to an aldehyde. The combination of MnO₂ and sulfuric acid can oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carbonyl group. Although oxidation to a carboxylic acid is also possible under different conditions, proceeding with the aldehyde is more consistent with the subsequent reaction. Therefore, **Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). Acetone, in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forms an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Thus, **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Determination of the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3:**\nThe structure of product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is key to determining its symmetry. The molecule consists of a *p*-nitrophenyl group connected to a but-3-en-2-one chain. To achieve maximum stability through conjugation, the benzene ring, the nitro group, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group all tend to lie in the same plane.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry elements of this planar conformation:\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n*   **Proper Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the entire molecule (assuming the hydrogens of the methyl group are oriented to respect this plane).\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion. For example, inverting the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group does not result in an equivalent atom.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nA molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
