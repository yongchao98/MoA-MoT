    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis**:\n    *   The problem involves a proton ($p$) and a slow-moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   The total initial momentum of the system is therefore zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   So, $E_i = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis**:\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four particles have the same mass, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Let the velocity of each particle A be $v$. The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   According to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy ($E_i = E_f$).\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity (v)**:\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We need to rearrange this equation to solve for $v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591}$.\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
