    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from a solution of Ca-EDTA complex, we must consider the dissociation equilibrium of the complex.\n\n### 1. The Equilibrium Reaction\n\nThe Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻) is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The formation reaction is:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, K_f (also denoted as K_Ca-EDTA), which is given as 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n\nFor this problem, it is more convenient to consider the reverse reaction, which is the dissociation of the complex:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n### 2. Setting up the Calculation\n\nWe start with a stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex of 0.02 M. As the complex dissociates, it will produce equal amounts of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Let's denote the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ as 'x'. Therefore, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated (0.02 - x).\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant (K_d) is:\n\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the terms with 'x':\n\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n### 3. Solving for the Calcium Ion Concentration\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This indicates that the complex is very stable and only a tiny fraction will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by making the approximation:\n\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nWe can solve for x²:\n\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, we take the square root to find x:\n\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is validated by the result.\n\nThe problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by allowing the use of the given formation constant directly without adjusting for the protonation of EDTA at different pH levels.\n\n<<<C>>>"
