    "The search results did not provide a direct 13C-NMR spectrum for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. However, they provided information on related compounds and general principles of 13C-NMR, which support my initial analysis.\n\nMy step-by-step derivation of the final product E is as follows:\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: The aldehyde is protected as a thioacetal, forming 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: The strong base BuLi deprotonates the acidic proton at C2 (between the two sulfur atoms), forming a stabilized carbanion.\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to C2. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n4.  **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**: The thioacetal protecting group is removed, regenerating the carbonyl group. The product is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n5.  **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, the ylide is prepared from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine, followed by deprotonation with BuLi. This ylide is (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3. The ylide then reacts with the ketone (3-pentanone, (CH3CH2)2C=O). The result is the alkene E, which is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH2)2.\n\nNow, to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene):\n\nThe structure of E is:\n```\n      Et   Et\n      |    |\n     C=C\n    /   \\\n  Et     Et\n```\n\nDue to the high degree of symmetry in the molecule, we need to identify the chemically non-equivalent carbons. The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing perpendicularly through the center of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes pairs of carbons chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Olefinic carbons (C=C)**: The two carbons of the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry. They are in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one** signal.\n2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH2-)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. All four of these ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Consequently, the four methylene (-CH2-) carbons are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a second, single signal.\n3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH3)**: Similarly, the four methyl (-CH3) carbons at the ends of the four ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent because of the overall symmetry. This will result in a third, single signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms (2 from the double bond + 4*2 from the ethyl groups), the high symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene reduces the number of unique carbon environments to just three. Each unique environment gives one signal in the 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\nThe total number of signals is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
