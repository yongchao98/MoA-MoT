    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D based on the provided reaction sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Compound A\n\nCompound A exhibits two signals in its proton NMR spectrum: a triplet for 6 protons (6H) at 0.9 ppm and a quartet for 4 protons (4H) at 1.3 ppm. This pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The 6H triplet corresponds to the two -CH₃ groups being split by the two adjacent -CH₂- groups. The 4H quartet corresponds to the two -CH₂- groups being split by the three adjacent -CH₃ protons.\n\nThe reaction sequence involves monobromination followed by elimination to form an alkene, which are standard reactions for alkanes. While the proton NMR spectrum of n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃) is complex, introductory problems often simplify it by ignoring the coupling between the two central CH₂ groups. Under this simplification, the two CH₃ groups (6H) are treated as equivalent and couple to the adjacent CH₂ to form a triplet, and the two CH₂ groups (4H) are treated as equivalent and couple to the adjacent CH₃ to form a quartet. Therefore, Compound A is identified as **n-butane**.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Compound B\n\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. Radical bromination of n-butane can occur at a primary carbon (C1) or a secondary carbon (C2). Halogenation is more favorable at the more substituted carbon, so the major product will be from the reaction at the secondary carbon.\n\nCH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ + Br₂/hν → CH₃-CH₂-CHBr-CH₃\n\nThus, Compound B is **2-bromobutane**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Compound C\n\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), which promotes an E2 elimination reaction. According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (and more stable) alkene.\n\nElimination from 2-bromobutane can yield two products:\n1.  **But-1-ene** (CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₃)\n2.  **But-2-ene** (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\nBut-2-ene is the more substituted alkene and is the major product. The problem states that compound C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (cis- and trans-isomers). Therefore, Compound C is **but-2-ene**.\n\n### Step 4: Identification of Compound D\n\nThe final step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D.\n\n*   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n*   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene\n\nThis [4+2] cycloaddition reaction forms a six-membered ring. Let's determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product.\n\n1.  **Product Structure**: The reaction between the diene (C1-C4) and the dienophile (C5-C6) forms a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The diene provides an -OH group (at C1 of the diene) and a -CH₃ group (at C4 of the diene).\n    *   The dienophile provides two -CH₃ groups.\n    The resulting product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific.\n    *   **Dienophile Stereochemistry**: Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (at positions 5 and 6 of the product) will be *cis* to each other.\n    *   **Diene Stereochemistry**: For an (E,E)-diene, the two \"outer\" substituents (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4) will also be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   **Endo Rule**: The reaction kinetically favors the *endo* product. In the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile are positioned under the π-system of the diene. This results in the dienophile's substituents (the two methyl groups at C5 and C6) being *trans* to the diene's outer substituents (the -OH and the C4-methyl group).\n\n    Combining these rules, the relative stereochemistry of the major product D is:\n    *   The C1-OH and C4-CH₃ are *cis*.\n    *   The C5-CH₃ and C6-CH₃ are *cis*.\n    *   The pair of substituents from the diene (OH, C4-Me) is *trans* to the pair of substituents from the dienophile (C5-Me, C6-Me).\n\n3.  **Assigning Absolute Configuration (R/S)**: Let's assume one possible enantiomer where the C1-OH and C4-CH₃ are \"up,\" and the C5-CH₃ and C6-CH₃ are \"down.\"\n    *   **C1**: Has -OH (up) and -H (down). The priorities are: -OH > -C=C > -C6. The sequence is counter-clockwise, giving **1S**.\n    *   **C4**: Has -CH₃ (up) and -H (down). The priorities are: -C=C > -C5 > -CH₃. The sequence is clockwise, giving **4R**.\n    *   **C5**: Has -CH₃ (down) and -H (up). The priorities are: -C6 > -C4 > -CH₃. The sequence is clockwise. Since the lowest priority group (-H) is up, we reverse the assignment to counter-clockwise, giving **5S**.\n    *   **C6**: Has -CH₃ (down) and -H (up). The priorities are: -C1 > -C5 > -CH₃. The sequence is counter-clockwise. Reversing for the up -H gives clockwise, resulting in **6R**.\n\nThe resulting stereoisomer is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
