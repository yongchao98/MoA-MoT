    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning. Several sources provide the formulas for determining the mass of binary stars from their orbital period (P) and radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2).\n\nThe key relationship for the total mass (M1 + M2) of a spectroscopic binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass can be expressed as:\n\n(M1 + M2) * sin³(i) = [P / (2 * π * G)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   `M1` and `M2` are the masses of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. When `i` is 90 degrees, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This is a standard and necessary assumption for solving this problem. With this assumption, the equation simplifies to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2 * π * G)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\nI need to find the ratio of the total mass of system 1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system 2 (M_total_2).\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = { [P1 / (2 * π * G)] * (K1a + K1b)³ } / { [P2 / (2 * π * G)] * (K2a + K2b)³ }\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out, leaving:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, I will substitute the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nPlugging these into the ratio equation:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 * 3375) / 15625\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 6750 / 15625\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nRatio = (2 * 15³)/(1 * 25³)\nRatio = 2 * (3*5)³ / (5*5)³\nRatio = 2 * 3³ * 5³ / 5⁶\nRatio = 2 * 27 / 5³\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe calculation is correct. The result 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total mass of each binary system and then find the ratio between them.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that is also eclipsing, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) can be determined using the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's third law:\n\n(M₁ + M₂) sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period of the system.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for each star.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, we can assume that their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°. This means sin(i) is approximately 1, and therefore sin³(i) is also approximately 1. The formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWe can now calculate the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system 2 (M_sys2).\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = { [P₁ / (2πG)] * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ } / { [P₂ / (2πG)] * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ }\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values provided for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * 3375] / [1 * 15625]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432, which is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
