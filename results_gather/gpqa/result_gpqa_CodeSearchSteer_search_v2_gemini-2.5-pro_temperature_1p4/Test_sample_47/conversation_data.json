    "The user has provided a four-step chemical synthesis and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product. To answer this question, each step of the reaction must be correctly identified.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide.** This α-halo ketone undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Thus, product (2) is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.** This is a standard and well-known reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H).** This is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nWe can analyze the symmetry of the molecule to determine the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and in a distinct chemical environment. This is the first set of hydrogen.\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. This is the second set.\n*   **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the two CH₂ groups at positions 2 and 5 equivalent. However, within each CH₂ group, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means the hydrogen *cis* to the aldehyde group is different from the one that is *trans*. Therefore, the *cis* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the *trans* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, giving two more distinct sets of hydrogens. These are the third and fourth sets.\n*   **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the CH₂ groups at positions 3 and 4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two additional sets of distinct hydrogens. These are the fifth and sixth sets.\n\nIn total, there are six sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>"
