    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a type of chemical reaction known as a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement that occurs in 1,5-dienes, which are molecules containing two double bonds separated by three single bonds. The starting molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, fits this structural requirement.\n\nThe rearrangement proceeds through a cyclic, concerted mechanism where bonds are broken and formed simultaneously. Specifically, the sigma bond between carbon 4 and carbon 5 breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between carbon 2 and carbon 7. Consequently, the positions of the double bonds also shift. The original double bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4, and the one at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\nTo determine the name of the resulting molecule, one must identify the longest continuous carbon chain in the new structure and correctly locate the substituents and double bonds. Following the rearrangement:\n\n1.  **A new, longer carbon chain is formed.** This chain includes carbons from the original nonane backbone and the butyl group. The longest chain is found to have ten carbon atoms, making the base name of the product \"deca-\".\n2.  **The double bonds are repositioned.** The new double bonds are located starting at the first and fifth carbons of this new ten-carbon chain. This makes the molecule a deca-1,5-diene.\n3.  **The substituents are identified on the new chain.** The methyl group (originally C1 of the nonane chain) is now at the third position of the deca-diene chain. The ethyl group (originally C8 and C9) is at the fourth position.\n\nPutting this all together, the IUPAC name of the product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
