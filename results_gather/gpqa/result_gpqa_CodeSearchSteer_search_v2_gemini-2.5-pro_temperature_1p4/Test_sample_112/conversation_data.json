    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**\n\nFirst, the IHD (or degrees of unsaturation) for each possible formula is calculated. The IHD indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n**2. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid appears around 1710 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is a clear indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is also confirmed. A carboxylic acid contains one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond), and an alkene contains another, for a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which aligns with the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically show signals in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**4. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragment in mass spectrometry. The most common and stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺. Its presence provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid. While other fragments could have this m/z value, the [COOH]⁺ fragment is the most logical interpretation given the supporting FTIR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the pieces of evidence point towards a single conclusion:\n\n*   The compound contains a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH), as shown by the FTIR and MS data.\n*   The compound contains an **alkene** group (C=C), as indicated by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data.\n*   The presence of both a C=O bond (in the acid) and a C=C bond requires an IHD of at least **2**.\n\nRevisiting the possible formulas and their IHDs:\n*   **C6H10O2:** IHD = 2. This formula has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct IHD for a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n*   **C6H12O:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen and has an insufficient IHD.\n*   **C6H10O:** IHD = 2. This is incorrect. It lacks an oxygen to be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H12O2:** IHD = 1. This is incorrect. It has the right number of oxygens, but the IHD is too low to accommodate both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
