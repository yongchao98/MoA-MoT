    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the relationship between the number of stars, parallax, and distance:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. This can be expressed as:\n    *   `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Use the given information about the number of stars and parallax.** The problem states that the number of stars (N) up to a certain parallax varies as 1/plx⁵.\n    *   `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to distance.** Substitute the relationship between parallax and distance from step 1 into the given formula from step 2.\n    *   Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, it follows that `plx⁵ ∝ (1/r)⁵ = 1/r⁵`.\n    *   Substituting this into the formula for the number of stars gives:\n        `N ∝ 1/(1/r⁵)`, which simplifies to `N ∝ r⁵`.\n    *   This means the *cumulative number of stars* out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance (dN/dr). To find this, we differentiate the expression for N with respect to r.\n    *   If `N = k * r⁵` (where k is a constant of proportionality)\n    *   Then `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r⁴.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\nThis result indicates that the number of stars per unit range of distance increases with the fourth power of the distance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
