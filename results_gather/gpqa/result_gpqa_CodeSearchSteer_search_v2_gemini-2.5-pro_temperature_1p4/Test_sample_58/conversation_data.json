    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to provide two hydroxide ions (OH⁻) per molecule (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   The H⁺ ions will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH₃COOH will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with CH₃COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition of the solution:**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution has an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻ ions. This makes the solution strongly basic. The contribution to the pH from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n**4. Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻ and the pH:**\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
