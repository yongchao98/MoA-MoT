    "Here is a step-by-step resolution of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" (`Δτ` or `t₀`) because it's the time measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The objective is to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame, which we'll call `Δx`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the theory of special relativity.\n    *   The key principle here is **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for events happening in a moving frame (the ejecta) than the time measured within the moving frame itself (`Δt'`).\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated by `Δx = v * Δt`. Notice that we must use the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame, not the time from the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (`Δt`):**\n    *   The time dilation formula relates the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) to the proper time (`Δt'`) using the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor, γ, is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n    *   **First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (`β`):**\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ`):**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n    *   **Now, calculate the dilated time (`Δt`) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n    *   **Finally, calculate the distance (`Δx`) traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   This value is extremely close to option B. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
