    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair:**\n    The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   The substance KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), which acts as the weak acid in this buffer.\n        *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   The substance Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺, the monohydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), and water. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base.\n        *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the buffer:**\n    The buffer system is based on the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves the equilibrium between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    The equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\n    We can find the [H⁺] using the Ka₂ expression:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻):**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the monohydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This equilibrium is governed by Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\n    We can find the [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka₃ expression:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
