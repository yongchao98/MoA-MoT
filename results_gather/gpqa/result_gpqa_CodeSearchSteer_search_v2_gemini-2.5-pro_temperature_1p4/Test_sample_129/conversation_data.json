    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. The Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet (UV) radiation from reaching the ground.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength (λ_emitted)**: The absorption by neutral hydrogen occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Å. This is in the far-ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff (λ_observed_min)**: Ground-based optical telescopes can only detect light that passes through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3200-3300 Å. While some limited transmission occurs down to 3000 Å, the practical limit where observation becomes feasible is often cited as being higher. The optical window for astronomy is typically considered to start around 3300 Å to 4000 Å. For the Lyα line to be detectable, its redshifted wavelength must be longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The relationship between emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n    `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`\n\n    To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the minimum wavelength that can be detected from the ground. Let's use a conservative but common value for the atmospheric cutoff, around 3500 Å to 3600 Å. Some sources state the Lyα forest is readily accessible for `z > 2`. Let's calculate the redshift for several cutoff values.\n\n    Using the redshift formula rearranged to solve for z:\n    `z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1`\n\n    *   If we take the atmospheric cutoff (λ_observed) to be approximately 3650 Å:\n        z = (3650 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n        z = 3.001 - 1\n        z ≈ 2.0\n\n    Some observational studies begin their ground-based Lyα forest analysis at redshifts of z ~ 2. Other sources suggest a typical redshift of z ≳ 2.5 for ground-based observations. The variation depends on the specific observatory's atmospheric conditions and the spectrograph's sensitivity at the blue end of its range.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) z = 1.2: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å. This is deep in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   D) z = 1.9: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å. This wavelength is just at the edge of the atmospheric window, making detection difficult but possible under excellent conditions.\n    *   C) z = 2.4: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This is well within the optical range (blue light) and easily observable.\n    *   B) z = 3: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å. This is also well within the observable optical range.\n\n    The question asks for the *lower limit*. A redshift of z=1.9 pushes the Lyman-alpha line to ~3526 Å, which is where ground-based observations start to become feasible. While higher redshifts are more easily observable from the ground, 1.9 represents a reasonable lower boundary.\n\n<<<D>>>"
