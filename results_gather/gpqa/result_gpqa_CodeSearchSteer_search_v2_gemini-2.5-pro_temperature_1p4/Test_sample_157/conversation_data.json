    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that not only is non-functional but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other allele. The transcription factor in question must form a dimer to function. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the likely molecular events:\n1.  Both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y) protein subunits are produced in the heterozygous cell.\n2.  These subunits will attempt to dimerize. Three types of dimers can form: WT-WT (functional), WT-Y (non-functional), and Y-Y (non-functional).\n3.  The mutant Y protein dimerizes with the wild-type protein, creating a non-functional WT-Y heterodimer. This process \"poisons\" or sequesters the functional wild-type subunits, preventing them from forming functional WT-WT homodimers. This is the classic mechanism of a dominant-negative effect for a dimeric protein.\n4.  This interference effectively causes a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele because its protein product is trapped in an inactive complex.\n5.  Furthermore, improperly formed protein complexes, like a faulty dimer, are often recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. This would lead to the degradation of both the mutant and the wild-type subunits within the non-functional heterodimer, further reducing the total amount of functional protein.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While possible, aggregation is a more specific outcome. The direct and certain outcome is the formation of non-functional dimers leading to a loss of function. Degradation is a more common fate for such faulty complexes than aggregation.\n*   B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: This is incorrect because a dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant, not a wild-type, phenotype.\n*   C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss of the normal function, not a gain of a new or enhanced one.\n*   D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: This option accurately captures the key aspects. The mutant protein's interference causes a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\" A very common molecular consequence for such malformed protein complexes is being targeted for degradation, which is a well-documented mechanism for some dominant-negative mutants.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the mutant Y protein leads to the functional inactivation of the wild-type protein, often followed by degradation of the faulty complex.\n\n<<<D>>>"
