    "This problem deals with the physics of radioactive decay, which is a random process. The key principle to remember is that radioactive decay is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes as if we were starting from time zero.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that the atom *survives* (does not decay) for a duration of t. The decay process follows an exponential law, so we can write this probability as:\n    P(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant of the atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). This allows us to calculate the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    P(survival for 100 min) = 1 - P(decay within 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n3.  **Determine a Value for the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    Using the formula from Step 1, we can set up the equation:\n    0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the process is memoryless, this is simply the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n5.  **Solve the Equations:**\n    We can solve for the required probability without explicitly finding the numerical value of λ.\n    From the equation in Step 3, `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    We can rewrite the term `e^(-λ * 150)` as follows:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value 0.68:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    This value, 0.5607, is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n6.  **Find the Final Decay Probability:**\n    The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability of 0.4393 is equivalent to 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
