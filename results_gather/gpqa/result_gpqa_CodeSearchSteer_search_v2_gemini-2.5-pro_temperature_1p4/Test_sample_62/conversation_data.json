    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n### 1. Understand the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, this corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational energy levels. The vibrational quantum number is `v = 0`, and the rotational quantum number is `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. According to the selection rules for rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, for an absorption event, the change in the vibrational quantum number is `Δv = +1`, and the change in the rotational quantum number is `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from J=0, only `ΔJ = +1` is possible. Therefore, the final state is `v' = 1` and `J' = 1`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of a specific rovibrational state (v, J) is given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies:\n`E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (`4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s`).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n*   `v` and `J` are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference in energy between the final and initial states:\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial)** for (v=0, J=0):\n    `E_initial = (0 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n*   **Final Energy (E_final)** for (v=1, J=1):\n    `E_final = (1 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)`\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE)**:\n    `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ² / I`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I)\n\nThe moment of inertia `I` depends on the reduced mass `μ` and the bond length `R` (`I = μR²`).\n\n*   **Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu`\n    Convert amu to kg, using the conversion factor `1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg`.\n    `μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 × 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n*   **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    The bond length `R` is given as 2 angstroms, which is `2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n    `I = μR² ≈ (3.0192 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I ≈ (3.0192 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 × 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow, substitute the values back into the `ΔE` equation:\n\n*   **Vibrational Part (ħω):**\n    `ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.2183 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   **Rotational Part (ħ²/I):**\n    `(ħ²) / I = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ (1.1121 × 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2085 × 10⁻²³ J`\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = (4.2183 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00092085 × 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy of a photon (`E`) is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E = pc`. Therefore, `p = E / c`.\n\n*   Using `ΔE` for the photon's energy and the value of `c ≈ 2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s`.\n    `p = (4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s)`\n    `p ≈ 1.4071 × 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s` or `N·s`\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
