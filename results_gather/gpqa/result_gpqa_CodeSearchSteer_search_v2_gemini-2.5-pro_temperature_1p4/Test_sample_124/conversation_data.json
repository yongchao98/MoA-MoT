    "The provided potential, V(r) = 1/2 mω²r², corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy eigenvalues (E) for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\nEₙ = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nHere, *n* is the principal quantum number (n = nₓ + nᵧ + n₂, where nₓ, nᵧ, n₂ are non-negative integers), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the nth energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy (gₙ) can be calculated using the formula:\ngₙ = (n+1)(n+2) / 2\n\nFor the third excited state, we set n = 3:\ng₃ = (3+1)(3+2) / 2\ng₃ = (4)(5) / 2\ng₃ = 10\n\nThis degeneracy arises from the number of ways the integer quantum numbers nₓ, nᵧ, and n₂ can be chosen to sum to n=3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its two other permutations.\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its five other permutations.\n*   (1, 1, 1) as a single combination.\n\nThe total number of combinations is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\nBased on these calculations, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**, and its degeneracy is **10**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
