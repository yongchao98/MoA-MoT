    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion.\n\n**1. Understand the Decay Process**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). The decay is represented by the equation:\n\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nThe initial pion is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum of the system must also be zero. This means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   p(μ⁺) = p(ν)\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m(π⁺)c²\n    *   Final Energy (E_final) = Energy of muon + Energy of neutrino = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n    *   Therefore, m(π⁺)c² = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Kinematics**\n\nWe are given the rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m(π⁺)c²) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m(μ⁺)c²) = 105.7 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless for this calculation, which is a standard approximation.\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nFor the muon (μ⁺): E(μ⁺)² = (p(μ⁺)c)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\nFor the massless neutrino (ν): E(ν) = p(ν)c\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the products in a two-body decay from rest.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE(μ⁺))**\n\n    The kinetic energy of the heavier decay product (the muon in this case) can be calculated with the following formula, derived from the conservation laws:\n\n    KE(μ⁺) = [m(π⁺)c² - m(μ⁺)c²]² / [2 * m(π⁺)c²]\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    KE(μ⁺) = (139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV)² / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\n    KE(μ⁺) = (33.9 MeV)² / 279.2 MeV\n    KE(μ⁺) = 1149.21 MeV² / 279.2 MeV\n    KE(μ⁺) ≈ 4.116 MeV\n\n    This value is approximately **4.12 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE(ν))**\n\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy in the decay (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest mass and the final rest masses.\n\n    KE_total = m(π⁺)c² - m(μ⁺)c² - m(ν)c²\n    Since the neutrino's mass is taken as zero:\n    KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n    This total kinetic energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:\n    KE_total = KE(μ⁺) + KE(ν)\n\n    Now, we can find the neutrino's kinetic energy:\n    KE(ν) = KE_total - KE(μ⁺)\n    KE(ν) = 33.9 MeV - 4.116 MeV\n    KE(ν) ≈ 29.784 MeV\n\n    This value is approximately **29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing the calculated values (KE(μ⁺) ≈ 4.12 MeV and KE(ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV) with the given options, we find a match.\n\n<<<C>>>"
