    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial and Final State Properties\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value\n\nFirst, let's determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `E_1 = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300,000 MeV = 198,000 MeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `E_2 = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300,000 MeV = 99,000 MeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n*   `Q = E_i - (E_1 + E_2)`\n*   `Q = 300,000 MeV - (198,000 MeV + 99,000 MeV)`\n*   `Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV`.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3,000 MeV`.\n\n### 3. Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, the kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1 = p2`).\n\n*   `p1^2 = p2^2`\n*   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have:\n\n*   `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy equation:\n\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3,000 MeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1,000 MeV`\n\n### 4. Kinetic Energy T1 (Correct Relativistic Calculation)\n\nFor the correct relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. This gives `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\n*   `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`), we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute `T2 = 3,000 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198,000 MeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99,000 MeV` into the equation:\n\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198,000) = (3,000 - T1)^2 + 2*(3,000 - T1)*(99,000)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396,000*T1 = (9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + T1^2) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n\n*   `396,000*T1 = 9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000*T1`\n*   `396,000*T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n\n*   `396,000*T1 + 204,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n*   `600,000*T1 = 603,000,000`\n*   `T1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV`\n\n### 5. The Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T1.\n\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
