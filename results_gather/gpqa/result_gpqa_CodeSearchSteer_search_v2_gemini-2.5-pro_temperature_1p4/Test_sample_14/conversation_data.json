    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their geometric transit probabilities. The probability of a planet with a circular orbit transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n\n**Transit Probability (p) = R_star / a**\n\nTo find the semi-major axis (a), we can use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). The full form of the law is:\n\n**P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³**\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period\n*   M_star is the mass of the host star\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n\n**a = (G * M_star * P² / (4π²))^(1/3)**\n\nNow we can express the transit probability (p) as:\n\n**p ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)**\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (p₁) to that of Planet_2 (p₂):\n\n**p₁ / p₂ = [R_star₁ / (M_star₁ * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R_star₂ / (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3)]**\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n**p₁ / p₂ = (R_star₁ / R_star₂) * [(M_star₂ * P₂²) / (M_star₁ * P₁²)]^(1/3)**\n\nLet's substitute the given information into the equation:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: R_star₁ = R_star₂. This makes the term (R_star₁ / R_star₂) equal to 1.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_star₁ = 2 * M_star₂.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P₁ = (1/3) * P₂. Squaring this gives P₁² = (1/9) * P₂².\n\nNow, substitute these into the ratio equation:\n\n**p₁ / p₂ = 1 * [(M_star₂ * P₂²) / ((2 * M_star₂) * (1/9 * P₂²))]^(1/3)**\n\nThe M_star₂ and P₂² terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\n**p₁ / p₂ = [1 / (2 * 1/9)]^(1/3)**\n**p₁ / p₂ = [1 / (2/9)]^(1/3)**\n**p₁ / p₂ = (9/2)^(1/3)**\n**p₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)**\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\n**p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65096**\n\nTherefore, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This means that Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
