    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for these new phenomena.\n\nThe affected equations are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero, is a mathematical declaration that magnetic monopoles do not exist. If they did exist, the magnetic field lines could terminate on these \"magnetic charges,\" meaning the divergence would be non-zero. The equation would be changed to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (the \"curl\" of E). To maintain the symmetry of the equations, the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the existence of a \"magnetic current\" (the movement of magnetic charges). This magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, so a new term would be added to Faraday's Law.\n\nThe other two equations, Gauss's law for electricity (related to the flux of the electric field) and the Ampère-Maxwell law (related to the circulation of the magnetic field), would remain fundamentally unchanged as they deal with electric charges and currents.\n\nTherefore, the correct changes are to the equations governing the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
