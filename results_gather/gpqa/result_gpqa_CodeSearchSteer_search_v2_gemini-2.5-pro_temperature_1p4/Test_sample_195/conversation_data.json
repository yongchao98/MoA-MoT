    "The problem asks for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The solution can be found by applying the principle of conservation of energy within the framework of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy:** The total energy E of the system is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$), its potential energy ($U$), and its rest mass energy ($mc^2$). The relativistic kinetic energy is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Therefore, the total energy is $E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Displacement:** At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is 1, and the kinetic energy is 0.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum, $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Since the system is conservative, this total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position:** The speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** By equating the total energy at the maximum displacement and the equilibrium position, we get:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    *   Divide the equation by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n    *   Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   To isolate $v_{max}$, square both sides:\n        $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
