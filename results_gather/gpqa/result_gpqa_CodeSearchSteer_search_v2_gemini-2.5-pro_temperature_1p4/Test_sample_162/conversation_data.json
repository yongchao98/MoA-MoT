    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Write the balanced chemical equation**\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a basic solid, in a strong monobasic acid (like HCl, represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of O ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can find the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\nMoles = mass / Molar Mass\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum volume of acid required**\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" refers to the stoichiometric amount of acid needed to completely react with all the Fe(OH)₃. According to the reaction stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nMoles of H⁺ required = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nMoles of H⁺ required = 3 * 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol.\n\nThe acid concentration is given as 0.1 M (or 0.1 mol/L). We can calculate the volume needed:\nVolume = Moles / Concentration\nVolume of acid = 0.0028073 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028073 L.\n\nTo convert this volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\nVolume of acid = 0.028073 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.073 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.073 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in option A (28.05 cm³). The small difference is likely due to rounding of atomic masses used in the calculation. This strongly suggests that option A has the correct volume.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\nAfter the stoichiometric amount of acid has been added and has reacted, the Fe(OH)₃ is completely converted into Fe³⁺ ions. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\nThe concentration of Fe³⁺ ions is:\n[Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.00936 M.\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion is acidic and hydrolyzes in water, establishing an equilibrium that produces H⁺ ions and thus lowers the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (the acid dissociation constant, Ka) for Fe³⁺ at 25°C is approximately 6.5 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the final H⁺ concentration. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n\n|                | Fe³⁺(aq)    | Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) | H⁺(aq) |\n|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------|\n| **Initial (I)**| 0.00936     | 0            | ~0     |\n| **Change (C)** | -x          | +x           | +x     |\n| **Equil. (E)** | 0.00936 - x | x            | x      |\n\nNow, we use the Ka expression:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n6.5 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.00936 - x)\nx² = 6.5 × 10⁻³ * (0.00936 - x)\nx² = 6.084 × 10⁻⁵ - 0.0065x\nx² + 0.0065x - 6.084 × 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for x (where x = [H⁺]):\nx = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a\nx = [-0.0065 ± √((0.0065)² - 4(1)(-6.084×10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 ± √(4.225×10⁻⁵ + 2.4336×10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 ± √(2.8561×10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.0065 ± 0.0169] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (0.0104) / 2 = 0.0052 M.\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of H⁺ is 0.0052 M. Now we calculate the pH:\npH = -log₁₀([H⁺])\npH = -log₁₀(0.0052) ≈ 2.28\n\nOur calculated pH is 2.28. This does not exactly match the pH of 2.04 in option A. However, the calculation for the volume (28.07 cm³) robustly matches the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The discrepancy in pH could arise from several factors, such as the use of a slightly different Ka value or the influence of further hydrolysis steps (e.g., dimer formation) which would make the solution more acidic (lower pH). Among the given choices, option A is the only one that presents the correct stoichiometric volume required for the reaction. The alternative, Option D, relies on a chemically flawed assumption of ignoring the acidity of the Fe³⁺ ion. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal Answer is pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3\n\n<<<A>>>"
