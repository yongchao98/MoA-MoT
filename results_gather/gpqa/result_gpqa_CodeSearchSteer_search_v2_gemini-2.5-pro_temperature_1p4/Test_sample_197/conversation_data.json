    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, a calculation based on the principles of chemical equilibrium and complex formation is required. The provided data includes the total cobalt concentration, the thiocyanate concentration, and the overall stability constants (β) for the formation of the various cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, free cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) are in equilibrium with a series of complexes formed by reacting with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by their respective overall stability constants: β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄.\n\n**2. Calculation Steps**\n\nFirst, we define a term, α (alpha), which represents the ratio of the total cobalt concentration to the free Co²⁺ concentration. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate the value of α:\nα = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nα = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nα = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nα = 2.3646\n\nNext, the fraction of any specific cobalt species, such as [Co(SCN)₂], can be found by dividing its corresponding term in the alpha equation by the total value of α.\n\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / α\n\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = (40 × 0.1²) / 2.3646\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 / 2.3646\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this fraction as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] ≈ 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis result is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
