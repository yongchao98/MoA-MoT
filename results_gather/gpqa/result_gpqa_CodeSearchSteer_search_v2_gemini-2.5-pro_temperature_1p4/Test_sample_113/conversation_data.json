    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the correct reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, CN⁻.\n2.  **Mechanism**: The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n3.  **Role of Reagent A**: The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons, i.e., an acid. A general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. Using NaCN is often followed by an acidic workup to ensure the formation of the cyanohydrin.\n\nBased on this analysis, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n1.  **Transformation**: The cyano group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction, as indicated by the presence of water (H₂O).\n2.  **Role of Reagent B**: The hydrolysis of nitriles is typically a slow reaction and requires a catalyst. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating. The reaction with a dilute acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) under reflux is a standard method for this conversion. A weak acid, such as acetic acid (CH₃COOH), would not be effective for this hydrolysis.\n3.  **Product Formation**: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis directly yields the carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, a strong acid is required for this transformation. Between the choices of CH₃COOH (a weak acid) and HCl (a strong acid), **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
