    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves the treatment of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) followed by aqueous acid. This two-step process is known as anti-dihydroxylation, which adds two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond, with each group on the opposite face of the original double bond plane. The stereochemical outcome is specific and depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This step produces a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top or bottom face with equal probability, resulting in a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the point of attack.\n    *   Ring-opening of (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Ring-opening of (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a center of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical alkene, the resulting *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane is a meso compound (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed ring opening involves a backside attack by water.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso-epoxide leads to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral and cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   However, achiral columns can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   In this case, the enantiomeric pair—(4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol—will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a second, separate peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n*   A chiral column can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n    1.  A peak for meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n    2.  A peak for (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  A peak for (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct observation is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
