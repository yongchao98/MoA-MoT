    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Benzoquinone:**\nFor a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\nThis compound has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons, and they each have hydrogen atoms. Due to the presence of these α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and particularly stable compound. Because of this aromatic stabilization, the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common indicator of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nThe chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)CO₂CH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are optically active (unless they are a racemic mixture). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism and exists as D and L isomers.\n\n**Dimethyl fumarate:**\nThe chemical formula is (CH₃OOC)CH=CH(COOCH₃), and it is the trans-isomer. The molecule is planar around the central carbon-carbon double bond. There is no chiral carbon atom, as no carbon is bonded to four different groups. Due to its planar structure and a center of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n<<<B>>>"
