    "The solution to this problem involves applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels at a given temperature. The stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), allowing the use of this equation.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (N₂ and N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The problem states that the observed ratio of atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature drops). Let's define the ratio as R = N₂/N₁, where N₂ is the number of atoms in the higher energy level and N₁ is the number in the lower energy level.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\nR = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for this problem).\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAs the temperature T decreases, the term -ΔE/(k*T) becomes more negative, causing the exponential term, and thus the ratio R, to decrease. This matches the observation described in the problem.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy difference between the two levels can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition using the Planck-Einstein relation, E = h * c / λ.\n\nGiven:\n*   Wavelength (λ) = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n*   Planck's constant (h) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\nCalculation:\nΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n### 3. Set Up the Ratio of Ratios\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of R at 6000 K to R at 5500 K.\n\nLet:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   R_nospots be the population ratio at T_nospots.\n*   R_spots be the population ratio at T_spots.\n\nThe factor is F = R_nospots / R_spots.\n\nF = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out:\nF = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\nF = exp [ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Factor\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the exponent:\n*   ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99490 K\n*   (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹ ≈ -1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the factor F:\nF = exp [ -99490 * (-1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ]\nF = exp [ 1.507 ]\nF ≈ 4.51\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
