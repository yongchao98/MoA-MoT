    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons to be `L_1z = -ħ` and `L_2z = -ħ`. This corresponds to the quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\nHere:\n*   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum (`L_z`) is the sum of the individual z-components (`L_1z` and `L_2z`). The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the equation:\n`m = m_1 + m_2`\n\nIn this problem, the system is in a state with a definite value of `m = -1`. If a measurement of the individual z-components `L_1z` and `L_2z` is made, the resulting quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must satisfy this condition.\n\nWe want to find the probability of the measurement outcome `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the state of the system:\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThe sum of the measured z-components is -2, which is not equal to the system's total z-component quantum number `m = -1`. Because the measurement outcome is inconsistent with the initial state of the system, the probability of observing this outcome is zero.\n\nTo confirm this more formally, we can express the coupled state `|l, m> = |2, -1>` as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>`. The coefficients of this expansion are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state `|2, -1>` is a superposition of states where `m_1 + m_2 = -1`. The possible combinations for `(m_1, m_2)` are `(0, -1)` and `(-1, 0)`. The expansion is:\n`|1, 1, 2, -1> = (1/√2)|1, 0>|1, -1> + (1/√2)|1, -1>|1, 0>`\n\nThe probability of measuring `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state onto the outcome state `|1, -1>|1, -1>`.\n`P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n\nSince the uncoupled basis states are orthogonal, the state `|1, -1>|1, -1>` is orthogonal to both `|1, 0>|1, -1>` and `|1, -1>|1, 0>`. Therefore, the inner product is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
