    "To determine the correct option, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed of the astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity-addition formula to find the speed of the first astronaut (v₁) as observed by the second astronaut (v₂). The formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c (velocity of the first astronaut, mass 2m)\n*   v₂ = 0.5c (velocity of the second astronaut, mass 3m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nThe relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\nE_total = E₁ + E₂ = (γ₁ * m₁ * c²) + (γ₂ * m₂ * c²)\n\n**For the first astronaut (m₁ = 2m, v₁ = 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ₁:\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(0.64)\nγ₁ = 1 / 0.8\nγ₁ = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy E₁:\nE₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE₁ = 2.5mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (m₂ = 3m, v₂ = 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor γ₂:\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(0.75)\nγ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy E₂:\nE₂ = 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE₂ ≈ 3.4641mc²\n\n**Finally, calculate the total energy E_total:**\n\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.9641mc²\n\nThe total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **E ≈ 5.96mc²**\n\nOption D matches these results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
