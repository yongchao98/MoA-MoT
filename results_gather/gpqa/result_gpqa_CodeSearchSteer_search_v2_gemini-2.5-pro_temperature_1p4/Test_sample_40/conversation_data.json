    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula, a key concept in Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. This formula is necessary because velocities do not simply add together in a linear fashion, especially at speeds approaching that of light. The historical Fizeau experiment in 1851, which measured the speed of light in moving water, was a crucial early piece of evidence that could only be satisfactorily explained later by special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation for the speed of light in the moving glass as seen by the laboratory observer:\n\n1.  **Speed of light in the glass's rest frame:** The index of refraction, *n*, is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (*c*) to the speed of light in the medium (*u'*). Given that the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, is set to 1, the speed of light as measured within the glass is *u'* = *c*/*n* = 1/*n*.\n\n2.  **Frame velocities:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   The glass is the moving reference frame (S') and it moves with velocity *v* relative to the laboratory.\n    *   The light beam moves at speed *u'* = 1/*n* relative to the moving glass (S').\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** The formula to find the velocity of an object (*u*) in the stationary frame (S) when its velocity in the moving frame (S') is *u'*, and the moving frame's velocity is *v*, is:\n\n    *u* = (*u'* + *v*) / (1 + *u'* *v* / *c*²)\n\n4.  **Applying the values:** We substitute the known values into the formula, remembering that *c* = 1:\n\n    *u* = ( (1/*n*) + *v* ) / ( 1 + (1/*n*) *v* / 1² )\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    *u* = (1/*n* + *v*) / (1 + *v*/*n*)\n\n5.  **Final Simplification:** To make the expression match one of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by *n*:\n\n    *u* = *n* * (1/*n* + *v*) / *n* * (1 + *v*/*n*)\n\n    *u* = (1 + *n*v) / (*n* + *v*)\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
