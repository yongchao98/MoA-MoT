    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on the system in state `|ψ⟩` will yield the eigenvalue 0. This is a standard procedure in quantum mechanics governed by the Born rule.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and the Observable Operator:**\n*   The state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩`:\n    ```\n    [-1]\n    [ 2]\n    [ 1]\n    ```\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    ```\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0   ]\n    [ 1/√2,  0,   1/√2 ]\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0   ]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the State Vector:**\nBefore calculating probabilities, the state vector must be normalized.\n*   The squared norm of `|ψ⟩` is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    ```\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable:**\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n*   The eigenvalue equation is `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`. For the eigenvalue `λ = 0`, this becomes `P|v⟩ = 0`.\n    ```\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0   ] [x]   [0]\n    [ 1/√2,  0,   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n    [ 0,   1/√2,   0   ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n*   From the first and third rows of the matrix equation, we get `(1/√2) * y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n*   From the second row, we get `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0`, which simplifies to `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n*   Therefore, any eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is proportional to `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector:**\nWe also need the normalized eigenvector, let's call it `|v_0⟩`.\n*   The squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector `|v_0⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |v_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]\n    ```\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability:**\nAccording to the Born rule, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n*   Probability `Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v_0 | ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\n*   First, calculate the inner product `⟨v_0 | ψ_norm⟩`:\n    ```\n    ⟨v_0 | ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) · ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )\n    ```\n    `= (1/√12) * ( (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1)`\n    `= -2 / √12`\n    `= -2 / (2√3)`\n    `= -1 / √3`\n\n*   Now, square the magnitude to find the probability:\n    ```\n    Prob(λ=0) = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3\n    ```\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
