    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly greater than the inherent energy uncertainties of each level. This energy uncertainty is a direct consequence of the finite lifetime of the quantum states, as described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ≥ ħ / (2 * Δt)\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the state.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. At a minimum, the difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. The broader linewidth belongs to the state with the shorter lifetime, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be significantly larger than this value. Let's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is significantly smaller than the energy uncertainties.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is about 1,000 times larger than the largest energy uncertainty (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This would allow for a clear distinction between the two energy levels.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far too small.\n\nThe only option that provides a sufficient energy separation to clearly resolve the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
