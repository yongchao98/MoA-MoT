    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and its components:**\n    The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   Number of protons = 3\n    *   Number of neutrons = 3\n    *   Total number of nucleons (A) = 3 + 3 = 6\n    The nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the theoretical rest mass (m₀):**\n    For this calculation, we will consider the sum of the individual masses of the constituent protons and neutrons, as this method aligns with the provided options.\n    *   Mass of a proton ≈ 1.007825 amu\n    *   Mass of a neutron ≈ 1.008665 amu\n    *   Total mass (m₀) = (3 * 1.007825 amu) + (3 * 1.008665 amu) = 3.023475 amu + 3.025995 amu = 6.04947 amu.\n\n3.  **Calculate the rest energy (E₀):**\n    The rest energy is given by Einstein's equation, E₀ = m₀c². We will use the conversion factor 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c².\n    *   E₀ = 6.04947 amu * 931.494 MeV/c²\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5634.61 MeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is determined by the velocity (v) of the nucleus, which is given as 0.96c.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n5.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E):**\n    The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5634.61 MeV\n    *   E ≈ 20123.6 MeV\n\n6.  **Convert the energy to GeV and compare with options:**\n    Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the result.\n    *   E ≈ 20.1236 GeV\n\n    Comparing this result with the given choices:\n    A) 21.419 GeV\n    B) 23.069 GeV\n    C) 20.132 GeV\n    D) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.1236 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n<<<C>>>"
