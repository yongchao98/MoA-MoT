    "The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, under the specified conditions, is the ability to break down the complex problem into smaller, independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously.\n\nWhen the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional (rational) function, this rational function can often be decomposed using a linear partial fraction expansion. This expansion breaks the single, complex calculation into a sum of several simpler calculations. Each of these simpler terms can be solved independently and concurrently on a different processor. The final solution is then obtained by combining the results from each processor.\n\n*   **Complex roots (A)** are a property of the approximation, but not the direct enabler of parallelism. In fact, methods often seek real poles to avoid complex arithmetic.\n*   **Nonlocal boundary conditions (B)** would introduce dependencies across the domain, making parallelization more difficult, not enabling it.\n*   **Stability analysis (D)** is a crucial requirement for any valid numerical method, but it does not, by itself, provide the mechanism for parallelization.\n\nTherefore, the decomposition into linear partial fractions is the essential step that facilitates the distribution of work across multiple processors.\n\n<<<C>>>"
