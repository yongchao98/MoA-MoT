    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Normalization of the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the squared norm `<ψ|ψ>`. The bra vector `<ψ|` is `(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|`.\n\n`<ψ|ψ> = ((1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nThus, the normalized state `|α>` is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. The Operator A and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A is defined by `Aij = ħ/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is `(ħ/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix (`σ_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n*   `λ₁ = +ħ/2`\n*   `λ₂ = -ħ/2`\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n    `[[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, so `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n    `[[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, so `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Probabilities of Measurement**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_n` is given by `P(λ_n) = |<v_n|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₁ = +ħ/2` (P₁):**\n    `P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i + 2 - i] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₂ = -ħ/2` (P₂):**\n    `P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Average Value of the Operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n*   Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities\n    `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2)`\n    `<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n*   Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <α|A|α>`\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 2i - i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
