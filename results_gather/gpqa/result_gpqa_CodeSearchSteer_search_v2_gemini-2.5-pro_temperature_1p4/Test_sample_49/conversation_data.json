    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `(4π)` in the denominator of the mathematical expression for its amplitude. This is a standard result from the evaluation of loop integrals in quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nHere's how to determine the loop number from the given expression:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral over the momentum of a virtual particle contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the amplitude after regularization and integration. Therefore, an expression for a diagram with *L* loops will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe note on your colleague's desk has the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general formula, we can set up a simple equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for *L*, the number of loops, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other parts of the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), numerical factors (`sqrt(2) * 8`), and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the specific particles, interaction strengths, and kinematics of the diagram, but the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the loop number.\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
