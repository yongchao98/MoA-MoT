    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n1.  **Composition**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Formula Calculation**: The mass fraction of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CnHm) is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass. Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `0.1428 ≈ 1/7`\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n3.  **Identification**: The general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n4.  **Properties**: Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:\n    *   Mass of H = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    *   Molar Mass of C6H12 = (6 × 12.011) + (12 × 1.008) = 72.066 + 12.096 = 84.162 g/mol.\n    *   Mass % of H = (12.096 / 84.162) × 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7).\n\nThus, substance Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is substance Z, cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the other component Y2.\n2.  **Properties**: Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both cyclohexane and Y2 are saturated compounds (or aromatic, which is unreactive to bromine water under these conditions).\n3.  **Reaction**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This means that hydrogenating Y2 also produces cyclohexane.\n4.  **Inference**: A plausible candidate for Y2 that fits these descriptions is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and does not decolorize bromine water. Its hydrogenation quantitatively produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Formation**: Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum. The disproportionation of unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons to form cyclohexane and benzene is a known reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Solve the Question\n\n1.  **Composition**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two different liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n2.  **Properties**:\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a cyclic structure.\n3.  **Reaction**: The conversion of the equimolar mixture X to the equimolar mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction. This means the overall chemical equation, with a 1:1 molar ratio for the components of X and Y, is:\n    `X1 + X2 —(Pt, heat)→ Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n4.  **Atom Balancing**: Let the formula for X1 be C6Ha and for X2 be C6Hb.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6`\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    `a + b = 12 + 6`\n    `a + b = 18`\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on the atom balance, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nTo further validate this, we can propose identities for X1 and X2. They must be C6 cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons. `a` and `b` must be less than 12 and sum to 18. Plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cyclohexadiene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n*   **X1**: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   **X2**: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This combination fits all the described conditions. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer where cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
