    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary. This involves interpreting the structural clues from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra and then matching the deduced structure to one of the given formulas.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The data indicates the presence of an ester group. An ester functional group contains two oxygen atoms (R-COO-R'). All the proposed chemical formulas (C₁₁H₁₂O₂, C₁₁H₁₄O₂, C₁₂H₁₂O₂, and C₁₂H₁₄O₂) are consistent with this, as they each contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals**: This suggests a di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄). With two non-equivalent substituents, a para (1,4) substitution pattern typically results in two distinct signals for the aromatic protons, often appearing as two doublets.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups**: One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The second methyl signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, this second signal is most likely from a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`).\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups**: This is a critical piece of information that helps to exclude certain structures.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula**\n\nBased on the NMR analysis, the compound consists of the following fragments:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (`-C₆H₄-`)\n*   A propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)\n*   A methyl ester group (`-COOCH₃`)\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to a plausible structure: methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data, including the absence of any –CH₂ groups.\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for this proposed structure:\n*   **Carbons**: 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from carbonyl `C=O`) + 1 (from methoxy `OCH₃`) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens**: 4 (from benzene ring) + 5 (from propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens**: 2 (from ester group).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 7. The proposed structure, which fits all the spectral data, has a degree of unsaturation of 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for the C=C bond, and 1 for the C=O bond). This formula is unlikely.\n*   **B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: This formula matches the one derived from the spectroscopic data and has the correct degree of unsaturation (6).\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: The degree of unsaturation for this formula is 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of both a benzene ring (4 units) and a vinyl group (1 unit), which requires at least 5 units, plus the ester's carbonyl group (1 unit), for a total of 6. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n*   **D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 6, which is consistent with the required functional groups. However, to construct a molecule with this formula from the core C₁₁H₁₂O₂ structure, one carbon and two hydrogens must be added. This would typically involve adding a -CH₂- group (e.g., forming an ethyl ester instead of a methyl ester). The presence of a -CH₂- group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
