    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two points in the titration.\n\n### **1. Initial Conditions and Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles\n\n*   **Concentration After Dilution:**\n    *   The initial 20.00 cm³ of acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains 0.001 moles.\n    *   New concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### **2. Titration Reaction**\n\nThe reaction between the weak acid (acetic acid) and the strong base (NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n### **3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** To find the pH of a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used.\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of [CH₃COO⁻] to [CH₃COOH] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 moles). At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH at Equivalence Point (Ve):**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   The solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions, which makes the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculating [OH⁻]:** We can set up an equilibrium expression to find the concentration of hydroxide ions.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculating pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 5.48\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
