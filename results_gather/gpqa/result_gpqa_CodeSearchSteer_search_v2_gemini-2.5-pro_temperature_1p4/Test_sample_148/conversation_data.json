    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided experimental results to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data**:\n    *   The spectrum is mostly as expected, indicating the overall structure is correct.\n    *   A single alpha-proton appears as two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts.\n    *   The total integral for these two peaks is 1H, and their individual integrals are roughly equal. This suggests the presence of two different species in an approximate 1:1 ratio, both containing this alpha-proton.\n    *   Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two peaks must arise from two different chemical environments for that specific proton.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data**:\n    *   The LC (Liquid Chromatography) trace shows two separable peaks, also with roughly equal intensities. This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that have different interactions with the chromatography column. The fact they are separable on a standard LC column indicates they are not enantiomers.\n    *   The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data for *both* peaks shows the same mass, which corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the peptide. This rules out impurities like precursors or simple side-products that would have a different mass.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which would be detected as a different mass in the MS analysis. The data shows both LC peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most plausible explanation.\n    *   **Formation:** During chemical peptide synthesis, epimerization (the change in configuration at a single chiral center) is a known side reaction. This would convert some of the peptide from, for example, an all L-amino acid configuration to a mixture containing some D-amino acid at one position. The resulting molecules would be diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images). Atropisomers (isomers arising from hindered bond rotation) or stable cis/trans isomers of an amide bond are also types of diastereomers that would fit the observations.\n    *   **NMR:** Diastereomers are different compounds and will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for the spectral differences to be subtle, affecting only the protons near the site of stereochemical difference, such as the alpha-proton of the epimerized residue. This perfectly matches the observation of two peaks for the specific alpha-proton.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Diastereomers have identical masses but different three-dimensional shapes. This difference in shape allows them to be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC, resulting in two peaks. The fact that both peaks give the same mass spectrum is the classic signature of an isomeric mixture.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Standard ¹H NMR spectroscopy is an achiral technique, and enantiomers are indistinguishable, producing only a single set of peaks. Likewise, they cannot be separated by standard LC unless a chiral column is used. The observation of two peaks in both the NMR and the standard LC decisively rules out a simple enantiomeric mixture.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This describes a synthetic procedure (repeating a reaction step to ensure completion) rather than a specific chemical outcome that would result in a stable mixture of two isomers. While side reactions can occur during coupling, a \"double coupling\" product where, for example, two amino acids were added instead of one, would result in a product with a significantly different mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two distinct species by both NMR and LC, which are separable by chromatography but have the same mass, is a textbook case of a diastereomeric mixture. In the context of peptide synthesis, this most commonly arises from epimerization at one of the alpha-carbons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
