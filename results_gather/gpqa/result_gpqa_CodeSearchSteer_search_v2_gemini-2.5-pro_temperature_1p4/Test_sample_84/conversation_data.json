    "### Calculation of the Temperature Ratio Between Two Exoplanets\n\n**To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation based on fundamental principles of astrophysics. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is dependent on its star's temperature and the distance of the planet from that star. This distance, the semi-major axis, can be inferred from radial velocity measurements.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is calculated by balancing the energy absorbed from its star with the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_eff is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 (T_eq1) and Planet 2 (T_eq2), we can divide their respective equations. Given that both planets orbit the same star (constant T_eff and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes (`a_1` and `a_2`) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity (K) of a star, induced by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\n\nK ≈ sqrt(G / a) * (M_p / sqrt(M_star))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet's mass, and M_star is the star's mass. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to this radial velocity (K = c * Δλ / λ_0). We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ∝ (M_p / K)^2\n\nSince K is proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ, we can write:\n\na ∝ (M_p / Δλ)^2\n\nNow, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / Δλ_2)^2 / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nWe can calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis result is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
