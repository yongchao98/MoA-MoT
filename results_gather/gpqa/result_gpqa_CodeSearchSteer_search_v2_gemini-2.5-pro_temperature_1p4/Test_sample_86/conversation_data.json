    "To solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Composition:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms and features a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents on the ring must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n2.  **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n\nBased on these facts, one substituent must be a halogen atom (X). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable two-carbon acyl group is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThis leads to the structure of a halo-acetophenone. The general formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   **Carbon count:** 6 (benzene ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8 carbons. This matches the information.\n*   **Functional groups:** Di-substituted aromatic ring, carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This also matches perfectly.\n\nNow, we need to determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) by analyzing the provided ¹H NMR options. The ¹H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted benzene ring is highly dependent on the positions of the substituents.\n\nLet's analyze the ¹H NMR options:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest a different structure, like 2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. However, the description of both the aldehyde proton and the adjacent methylene protons (at 3.7 ppm) as singlets is atypical, as they should couple to form a triplet and a doublet, respectively.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option only accounts for 7 protons in total and shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region, making it incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4) substituted benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to coupling with its neighbor.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C(=O)CH₃). The chemical shift falls squarely in the expected range for an acetophenone methyl group (2.1-2.6 ppm).\n\nThe data in option D is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the reported ¹H NMR data for 4-chloroacetophenone is δ 2.61 (s, 3H), 7.45 (d, 2H), 7.91 (d, 2H). Similarly, for 4-bromoacetophenone, the data is δ 2.60 (s, 3H), 7.61-7.63 (d, 2H), 7.83-7.84 (d, 2H). These literature values are in excellent agreement with the data presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
