    "To determine the correct statement, we must analyze the properties of the given angular momentum operator, Ay.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator is given by `Ay = c∙S`, where `c = h/4π` and `S` is the matrix:\n```\nS = | 0  -i |\n    | i   0 |\n```\nSo, the operator `Ay` is:\n`Ay = (h/4π) * | 0  -i | = | 0        -i(h/4π) |`\n`                | i   0 |   | i(h/4π)     0      |`\n\nThis operator is the Y-component of the spin angular momentum for a spin-1/2 particle (`Sy`), where `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y` and `ħ = h/2π`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`a`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(Ay - aI) = 0`:\n\n`det | -a        -i(h/4π) | = 0`\n`    | i(h/4π)      -a     |`\n\n`(-a)(-a) - (-i(h/4π))(i(h/4π)) = 0`\n`a² - (-i²)(h/4π)² = 0`\n`a² - (1)(h/4π)² = 0`\n`a² = (h/4π)²`\n`a = ± h/4π`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `+h/4π` and `-h/4π`. These values are purely real. This immediately shows that statements **A** and **D** are incorrect, as they describe eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Eigenfunctions (Eigenvectors)\n\nNow let's evaluate statements **B** and **C**.\n\n*   **Statement C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.**\n    The matrix `Ay` is a representation of the operator within a specific basis, which is conventionally the eigenbasis of the Z-component `Az` (the \"spin-up\" `[1, 0]` and \"spin-down\" `[0, 1]` states). The eigenfunctions of `Ay`, which we can calculate, form a *different* basis (the eigenbasis of `Ay`). Since the eigenfunctions of `Ay` are not the same as the basis vectors in which `Ay` is written, statement C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Statement B: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.**\n    This statement has two parts to verify:\n    1.  **Can it be an eigenfunction of A²?** `A²` represents the total spin angular momentum squared operator, `S²`. For any spin-1/2 particle, `S²` is proportional to the identity matrix (`S² = s(s+1)ħ² I = (3/4)ħ² I`). Any vector in the space is an eigenvector of the identity matrix. Therefore, any eigenfunction of `Ay` is also an eigenfunction of `A²`. This is also confirmed by the fact that the operators `Ay` and `A²` commute (`[S², Sy] = 0`).\n    2.  **Can it be an eigenfunction of Az?** The Z-component of the angular momentum operator, `Az`, does not commute with the Y-component, `Ay`. Their commutation relation is `[Ay, Az] = iħAx`. Since they do not commute, they do not share a full set of common eigenfunctions. A measurement of the spin along the y-axis destroys any pre-existing information about the spin along the z-axis. Thus, an eigenfunction of `Ay` cannot be an eigenfunction of `Az`.\n\nSince both parts of statement B are correct, it is the correct statement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
