    "Here is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that is enantiomerically pure, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced using Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group at C3 into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the planar ketone are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either the front or the back, leading to the formation of two different products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), which will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three different stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Products Analysis by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer A)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer B)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different properties, so it will be separated. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally distinct and will have different retention times.\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of these separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak** (as it is chemically different from the others).\nTherefore, a total of **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
