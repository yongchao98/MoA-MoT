    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we can calculate the expectation values for σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Operator|ψ⟩. For an operator that is a linear combination of other operators, the expectation value is the linear combination of the individual expectation values.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z (⟨σ_z⟩):**\n\nThe eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ correspond to the eigenvalues +1 and -1 of σ_z, respectively.\n\nThe probability of measuring the spin-up state |↑⟩ is the square of the absolute value of its coefficient, which is (0.5)² = 0.25.\nThe probability of measuring the spin-down state |↓⟩ is ((√3)/2)² = 3/4 = 0.75.\n\nThe expectation value of σ_z is the sum of its eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (+1) * P(|↑⟩) + (-1) * P(|↓⟩)\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (1 * 0.25) + (-1 * 0.75) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x (⟨σ_x⟩):**\n\nThe operator σ_x acts on the basis states as follows:\nσ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩\nσ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩\n\nFirst, we apply the σ_x operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_x|↑⟩) + (√3)/2(σ_x|↓⟩)\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * ( (√3)/2|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n\nUsing the orthogonality of the states (⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1), the expression simplifies to:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * (√3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + ((√3)/2 * 0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = 2(√3)/4 = (√3)/2\n\n**3. Combine the expectation values:**\n\nThe expectation value of the full operator is:\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * ((√3)/2)\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
