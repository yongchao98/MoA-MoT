    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and describe the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe derivation involves calculating the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ by integrating over the charge and current densities at the source's \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at time $t$, accounting for the finite speed of light, c.\n\nThe resulting formulas for the potentials are:\n\nScalar Potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nVector Potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nIn these expressions:\n*   `q` is the charge.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   `d` is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n*   The term `[` ... $]_{t_r}$ signifies that all quantities inside the brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the vector potential, using the relationship $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nComparing these standard forms with the given choices:\n*   **A)** Has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n*   **B)** Uses the simple Coulomb potential for a static charge and an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$, which is invalid for a moving charge.\n*   **C)** Also uses the incorrect static potential.\n*   **D)** Correctly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
