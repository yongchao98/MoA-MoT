    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take for the 22-year-old astronaut, we need to consider the effects of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Distance to Earth**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance to the LMC has been measured with increasing accuracy over the years. A precise measurement places the distance at approximately 163,000 light-years from Earth.\n\n**2. Time of Travel (from Earth's perspective)**\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel from the LMC to Earth can be calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n\nThe time (Δt) as measured from Earth would be:\nΔt = distance / speed = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c ≈ 163,002.12 years\n\n**3. Time Dilation**\nFor the astronaut traveling at a relativistic speed, time will pass much slower than for an observer on Earth. This effect is known as time dilation and is described by the following formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   Δt is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nThe term `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)` is known as the Lorentz factor (γ). A pre-calculated value for the Lorentz factor at a speed of 0.99999987*c is approximately 627. We can use this to simplify the calculation:\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\n\n**4. Time Experienced by the Astronaut**\nNow we can calculate the time that will have passed for the astronaut:\n\nΔt' = 163,002.12 years / 627 ≈ 260 years\n\nAccording to these calculations, the journey would take approximately 260 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe alien astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut has a remaining lifespan of 128 years (150 - 22). Since the journey will take approximately 260 years from the astronaut's point of view, the astronaut will not survive the trip to Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the astronaut will die before reaching Earth.\n\n<<<A>>>"
