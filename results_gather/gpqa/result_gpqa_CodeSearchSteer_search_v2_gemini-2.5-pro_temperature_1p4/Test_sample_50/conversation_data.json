    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. This method allows us to replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge that, along with the original charge, replicates the electric potential outside the sphere.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge on the sphere creates an electric field that is identical to the field created by an image charge, `q'`, located inside the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external force to assemble the system. This is the negative of the integral of the attractive force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` from infinity to the distance `d`.\n\n1.  The force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is given by the force exerted by its image:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2`, where `q' = -qR/x` and `b = R^2/x`.\n    Substituting these gives the force as a function of `x`: `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n\n2.  The potential energy is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_external · dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_electric · dx`\n    `U = -∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n3.  Evaluating this integral yields:\n    `U = [-1/2 * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = (-1/2 * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1/2 * k * q^2 * R / (∞^2 - R^2))`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nA more direct method involves the potential energy of a charge in a potential field. The total energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n1.  The potential at `q` due to the induced charge is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\n2.  The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b`.\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R / d) / (d - R^2 / d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-q * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  The potential energy is then:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect (`R^2` instead of `R`).\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **Correct**.\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect (factor of 1/2 missing, `d` instead of `R`).\n*   D) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect (`d` instead of `R`, and `+` in the denominator).\n\n<<<B>>>"
