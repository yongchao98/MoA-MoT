    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal indicates three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any other protons (a singlet). This pattern and chemical shift are characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate (CH₃COO-).\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Alkene and Allylic Signals:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a single proton in the vinylic region (attached to a C=C double bond). It is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant, *J* = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons that are *trans* to each other are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons have smaller coupling constants, usually 6-14 Hz. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* configuration.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is also for a single vinylic proton. The splitting pattern, a doublet of quartets (dq), means it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (likely a methyl group) in the allylic position (adjacent to a double bond). It is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to a single proton.\n\n3.  **Putting the Pieces Together:**\n    *   The acetate group is confirmed by the signal at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The signals at 1.6 ppm (methyl group, doublet) and 5.5 ppm (vinylic H, doublet of quartets) fit a `CH₃-CH=` fragment. The methyl protons are split by the vinylic proton, and the vinylic proton is split by both the methyl group (quartet) and the other vinylic proton (doublet).\n    *   This structure accounts for all protons and their splitting patterns: a `CH₃` group is attached to a `CH=CH` double bond, which is in turn attached to the oxygen of an acetate group. This forms a propenyl acetate. A butenyl acetate would have an additional CH₂ group, which is not seen in the spectrum.\n    *   The J-coupling value of 16.0 Hz for the proton at 7.0 ppm confirms the *trans* geometry of the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate** based on the number of protons, their chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and particularly the large coupling constant indicative of a trans double bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
