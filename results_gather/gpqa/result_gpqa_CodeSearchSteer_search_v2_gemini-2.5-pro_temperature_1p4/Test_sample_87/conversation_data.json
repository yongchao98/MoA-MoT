    "The scenario describes a classic adaptive immune response initiated in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Here's a breakdown of the events and how they point to the correct process:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery:** The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, mimicking a natural infection route. The proteins that survive the stomach and are not trapped in mucus act as antigens.\n2.  **Antigen Uptake and B-Cell Activation:** These antigens reach the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine. Peyer's patches are specialized to sample antigens from the gut. Within these patches, B cells that recognize the viral protein are activated and begin to proliferate rapidly. This proliferation occurs in specialized microenvironments called germinal centers.\n3.  **Generation of Variability:** The crucial observation is the \"high variability\" found in the *variable heavy chain gene* of this proliferating cell population. This points directly to somatic hypermutation (SHM).\n    *   **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM)** is a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. This process is designed to create variants of the original B-cell receptor, some of which will have a higher affinity (a better fit) for the antigen. This mechanism is a hallmark of immune responses in Peyer's patches. B cells with higher affinity receptors are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate, leading to \"affinity maturation.\"\n\nLet's consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in the germinal center, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody's effector function (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut) but does not alter its antigen-binding specificity or generate the observed variability in the variable region.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic alterations to B cells or antibody genes.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B-cell receptors *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. It occurs during B-cell development in the primary lymphoid organs (the bone marrow). The experiment describes a process happening in mature, proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen exposure. Therefore, the high variability being generated at this stage is due to SHM, not the initial V(D)J recombination.\n\nIn summary, the identification of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches with high variability specifically in the variable gene segment following antigen exposure is a textbook example of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
