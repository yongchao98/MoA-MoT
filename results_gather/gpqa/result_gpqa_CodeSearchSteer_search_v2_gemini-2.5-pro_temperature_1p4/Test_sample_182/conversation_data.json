    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactant and the Reaction\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very strong reducing agent. This combination is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and the saturation of double and triple bonds.\n\n### 2. Determine the Effect of the Reagents on the Reactant's Functional Groups\n\nThe reactant, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has several functional groups that will be reduced:\n*   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** Will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Formyl Group (-CHO):** As an aldehyde, it will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Vinyl Group (C=C):** The carbon-carbon double bond will be reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group.\n*   **Cyclohexene Ring (C=C):** The double bond within the six-membered ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n\n### 3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\n\n*   **Starting Carbon Skeleton:** The reactant has a C10 skeleton (6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group). The reduction reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   **Final Structure:** The reaction reduces all double bonds and oxygen-containing groups. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. All the functional groups become simple alkyl substituents. The final product will be a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:** Since all double bonds are removed and only a single ring structure remains, the product is a saturated cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with 'n' carbon atoms has the general formula CnH2n. As the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n*   **Calculation from Formula (C10H20):**\n    The formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C, H, X, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively.\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Calculation from Structure:**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    Number of rings = 1.\n    Number of π-bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This value corresponds to the single ring in the final product's structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
