  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The inability to express the recombinant GADD45G protein is due to the early termination of translation by the ribosome.\n\nA detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the cause:\n\n1.  **Start and Tag Sequence:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, the universal start codon for Methionine. It is immediately followed by the coding sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag (`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`), which correctly translates to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This part of the construct is correct.\n\n2.  **Premature Stop Codon:** The sequence for the GADD45G gene should begin immediately after the HA tag sequence. The provided human GADD45G coding sequence starts with `ATGACTCTGG...` However, in the engineered construct, the sequence that follows the HA tag is `AAATGA`.\n\n3.  **Translation Termination:** When this sequence is translated in frame, the ribosome reads the codon `TGA`. According to the standard genetic code, `TGA` (or UGA in mRNA) is a stop codon. The presence of this premature stop codon signals the ribosome to detach from the mRNA, ceasing protein synthesis.\n\nAs a result, instead of producing a full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein, the cell produces only a tiny, non-functional peptide consisting of the HA-tag and a single extra amino acid (Lysine, from the `AAA` codon). This explains the observed failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\n<<<B>>>"
