    "Here is an analysis of the two reactions to identify the respective reactants, A and B.\n\n### Reaction A: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one\n\nThis reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol, known as the Pinacol rearrangement. The strong acid, H₂SO₄, protonates one of the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the reactant, which then leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. This is followed by the migration of an alkyl group, leading to a rearranged carbon skeleton. In cyclic systems, this can result in ring contraction or expansion.\n\nThe product is a spiro compound, 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one, which is formed from the rearrangement of a fused ring system. The reactant that would lead to this specific spiroketone via a Pinacol rearrangement is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**. This vicinal diol, when treated with acid, undergoes a 1,2-rearrangement to form the more stable spirocyclic ketone.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BuLi + H⁺ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis reaction sequence involves a strong base (BuLi) followed by a proton source (H⁺) to convert reactant B into an alcohol. This is characteristic of a Wittig rearrangement. Specifically, this is a-Wittig rearrangement, which involves the treatment of an ether with an organolithium compound.\n\nThe strong base, butyllithium (BuLi), deprotonates the carbon atom adjacent to the ether's oxygen atom. The resulting intermediate then rearranges to form a more stable alkoxide, which is subsequently protonated by H⁺ to yield the final alcohol product. For this specific transformation, the reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  The BuLi removes a proton from the benzylic carbon (the carbon attached to both the phenyl group and the ether oxygen).\n2.  This creates a carbanion, which then undergoes a-rearrangement where the prenyl group (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl) migrates to the benzylic carbon.\n3.  The final step is the protonation of the resulting alkoxide to give 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol.\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, reactant A is 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol and reactant B is (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
