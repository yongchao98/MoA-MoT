    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The molecule contains a double bond, and the atoms around it lie in a plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a single, distinct stereoisomer. The parent ring system is based on a norbornane-like structure, which is chiral. By naming a specific enantiomer, it confirms the compound is chiral and thus optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on both carbons are identical (H, CH₃, COOH). The (2R,3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry between the two chiral carbons. This type of compound is known as a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers and is therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso-compound above. In the (2R,3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. Because it is chiral, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the compound is chiral. The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, -CH₂-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH₂-), making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The nomenclature indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This highly symmetrical arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. An examination of the molecule reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are asymmetrically substituted. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
