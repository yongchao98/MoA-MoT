    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product 4 and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction of the diene precursor:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is intended to generate a highly reactive diene in situ. This type of reaction, though written with gem-dibromides which is unusual, is characteristic for forming dienes used in Diels-Alder reactions. The expected product is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, a cross-conjugated triene which is a known reactive intermediate.\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene acts as the diene, and the norbornadiene derivative acts as the dienophile. The norbornadiene has two double bonds, and two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, indicating a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. One molecule of the generated diene reacts with each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene system.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting structure is a complex polycyclic molecule, which is the double Diels-Alder adduct, with the tert-butoxy group at the bridgehead (C7) of the central norbornane skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** Aqueous acid is used to cleave the acid-labile tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The alcohol corresponding to product 1, with a hydroxyl group at the C7 position.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols. The secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** A polycyclic ketone with a carbonyl group at the C7 position of the original norbornane framework.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** The Diels-Alder reaction is reversible. At elevated temperatures, a retro-Diels-Alder reaction is favored by entropy (one molecule breaks into multiple molecules). Product 3 undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, regenerating the molecules that formed it.\n    *   The fragmentation yields two molecules of the diene, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    *   The dienophile part is released as **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Subsequent Reaction:** Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to extrude carbon monoxide (CO), forming the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The question asks for the final product 4. In this context, the stable organic product formed, besides the common solvent benzene and the gas CO, is the diene monomer. Although this diene is reactive, it is the product of the main thermal decomposition. Therefore, **Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. It consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1,3 and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at positions 5 and 6.\n*   **Symmetry:** At 150°C, the molecule will be undergoing rapid conformational changes. The time-averaged structure possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the midpoints of the C1-C6 and C3-C4 bonds.\n*   **Equivalence of Hydrogens:** Due to this C₂ symmetry:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. This is the first set of chemically distinct protons.\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. This is the second set.\n    3.  The methylidene group (=CH₂) on C5 is equivalent to the methylidene group on C6. Within each methylidene group, the two hydrogens are inequivalent (diastereotopic) because one is closer to the ring's interior than the other. The \"inner\" proton on C5 is equivalent to the \"inner\" proton on C6. This forms the third set.\n    4.  Similarly, the \"outer\" proton on C5 is equivalent to the \"outer\" proton on C6. This forms the fourth set.\n\nTherefore, there are **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 7\nD) 4\n\nOur analysis leads to 4 chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\n<<<D>>>"
