    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must assess two main criteria for each star: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### 1. ESPRESSO's Detection Limit\n\nWhen coupled with a single 8.2-meter Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), the ESPRESSO spectrograph can achieve an S/N of 10 in a one-hour (3600 seconds) exposure for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of about 17.1. Stars brighter than this (i.e., having a smaller magnitude number) will be detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### 2. Star-by-Star Analysis\n\nFirst, we must check if each star is observable from the Paranal Observatory, which is located at a southern latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. Stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with a visual magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is about -52° 41', placing it in the southern celestial hemisphere. This makes it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detection:** With a magnitude of -0.74, it is significantly brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Polaris has an average visual magnitude of about 1.98.\n*   **Observability:** As the North Star, Polaris is located very close to the north celestial pole, with a declination of approximately +89° 15'. From Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6°, Polaris never rises above the horizon and is therefore impossible to observe.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable** (due to non-visibility).\n\nFor the following hypothetical stars, we calculate their apparent magnitude (m) using their absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) with the formula:\n`m = M + 5 * log10(d/10pc)`\nAll are located at a declination of 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with M = 15 at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.0.\n*   **Detection:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M = 15 at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Detection:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M = 15 at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Detection:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M = 15 at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Detection:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n### Summary\n\n*   Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   Star c (10 pc): **Detectable**\n*   Star d (200 pc): **Not Detectable**\n*   Star e (5 pc): **Detectable**\n*   Star f (50 pc): **Not Detectable**\n\nCounting the detectable stars, we have a total of three.\n\n<<<B>>>"
