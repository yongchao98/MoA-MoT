    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is spin-1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin (`μ = γS`). For the moment to be aligned with the field and the energy to be minimized, the spin must be in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as `|+Z>`.\n\n2.  **Change in System**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude, `B`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian**: The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field: `H = -μ · B`. With the new field, this becomes `H = - (γS) · (Bŷ) = -γB S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution**: The initial state `|+Z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it will evolve over time. The expectation value (or average) of any measurement will change. The spin vector will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This precession is called Larmor precession.\n\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B`, the Larmor frequency is given by `ω = |γB|`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The spin starts aligned with `+Z`. As it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will decrease, pass through zero, become negative, and then return to its starting position. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor precession frequency.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z(t)>`, can be calculated to be `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` shows that the value oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
