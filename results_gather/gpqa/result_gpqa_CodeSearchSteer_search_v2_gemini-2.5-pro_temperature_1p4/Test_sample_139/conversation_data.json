    "The chemical riddle can be solved by systematically identifying each substance based on the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Substance B and its Melting Point:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is exceptionally close to 277 K, making **B = D₂O** a very strong hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Precipitate G and Liquid Y:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuteroxide compound, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For this reaction to occur, the reactants must contain deuterium. This suggests that the \"liquid Y\" is also **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n3.  **Gas W:** The reaction between substance X and liquid Y (D₂O) releases gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. If X is a deuteride and it reacts with D₂O, the released gas would be deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, satisfying the condition.\n\n4.  **Substance X and Organic Chemistry Clues:** We are told that \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". The \"very close analog\" would be the hydrogen-based version of the deuterated substance X. A crucial clue is that the reaction of a keto acid (general formula R-CO-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points to a reduction of both the ketone group and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This powerful reduction is characteristic of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Therefore, the analog is LiAlH₄, and **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Reaction:** Let's check if the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y (D₂O) matches all the clues:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LAH with water is violent, and the same applies to its deuterated forms.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is known to be a gelatinous precipitate, insoluble in water. Therefore, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum hydroxide yields alumina and water (2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This confirms the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nNow, we must calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Atomic Number Z=13).\n\nThe question requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the calculation (D≈2, Al≈27).\n\n*   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as four atoms of deuterium (D).\n    Mass = 4 × (mass of Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** In LiAlD₄, there is one atom of aluminium (Al).\n    Mass = 1 × (mass of Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    Sum = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminium isotopes)\n    Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
