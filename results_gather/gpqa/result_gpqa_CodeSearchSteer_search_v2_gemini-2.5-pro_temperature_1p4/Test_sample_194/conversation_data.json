    "To solve this problem, we will relate the orbital parameters of the two planets through their shared orbital inclination. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Transit Condition:** A planet exhibits a transit when its orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of its star from our point of view. The geometry of this alignment is described by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For a transit to occur, the center of the planet must pass over the stellar disk, meaning its impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1. An occultation, where the planet goes behind the star, will occur if a transit happens for a circular orbit. Thus, the limiting condition for the second planet is `b_2 <= 1`.\n\n2.  **Relating Planet Parameters:** The impact parameter `b` is related to the orbit's semi-major axis `a` and its inclination `i` by the formula `b = (a/R_s) * cos(i)`, where `R_s` is the stellar radius. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is the same. The stellar radius `R_s` is also constant for the system.\n\n3.  **Using Proportionality:** From Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period `P` is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis `a` (`P^2 ∝ a^3`), which means `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n    If we substitute this into the impact parameter equation, we find that `b ∝ P^(2/3)`. This gives us a direct relationship between the impact parameters and orbital periods of the two planets.\n\n4.  **Setting up the Ratio:** We can express this proportionality as a ratio:\n    `(b_2 / b_1) = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Maximum Period:** We are given the following for Planet 1:\n    *   `P_1 = 3` days\n    *   `b_1 = 0.2`\n\n    We want to find the maximum possible orbital period for Planet 2 (`P_2_max`). This will occur at the maximum possible impact parameter that still allows for a transit, which is `b_2_max = 1`. Now we can plug these values into our ratio:\n    *   `1 / 0.2 = (P_2_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n    *   `5 = (P_2_max / 3)^(2/3)`\n\n    To solve for `P_2_max`, we first raise both sides to the power of `3/2`:\n    *   `5^(3/2) = P_2_max / 3`\n    *   `P_2_max = 3 * 5^(3/2)`\n    *   `P_2_max = 3 * √(125)`\n    *   `P_2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    *   `P_2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets were not needed for this calculation, as the standard condition for a transit event relates to the planet's center crossing the stellar disk.\n\n<<<B>>>"
