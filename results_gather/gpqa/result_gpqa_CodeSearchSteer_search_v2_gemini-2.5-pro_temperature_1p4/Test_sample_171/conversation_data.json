    "The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the correct tool for this problem and is applicable to stellar photospheres under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states.\n\nThe derivation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N_b) to a lower energy state (N_a) is given by the Boltzmann equation.\n    (N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    where `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the states, `(E_b - E_a)` is the energy difference (ΔE), `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars:** We can write this equation for star 1 (temperature T_1) and star 2 (temperature T_2). Let's define the ratio of excited atoms (N_b) to ground-state atoms (N_a) as the \"excitation level,\" R.\n    *   For star 1: R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star 2: R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:** The problem states that the excitation level in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n    *   R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n4.  **Formulating the Equation:** By substituting the Boltzmann expressions, we get:\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    The statistical weights (g_b / g_a) cancel out, leaving:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Solving for Temperature:** To solve for the temperatures, we rearrange the equation:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n    Using the exponential rule e^x / e^y = e^(x-y), we get:\n    exp[(-ΔE / kT_1) - (-ΔE / kT_2)] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n6.  **Taking the Natural Logarithm:** Taking the natural log (ln) of both sides gives:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    Combining the terms in the parenthesis gives:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substituting the Given Values:** The problem provides that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental constant with a value of approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is:\n    (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    The units work out correctly, leaving a dimensionless number on the left side of the final equation.\n\n8.  **Final Result:** Substituting this value back into the equation yields:\n    1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)] = ln(2)\n    This simplifies to:\n    ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)]\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
