    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n\n1.  **Assumption of Uniform Distribution**: We start with the premise that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant everywhere. ρ represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Volume of Space**: Consider a sphere of radius *d* centered on the Sun. The volume of this sphere is given by the formula:\n    V = (4/3)πd³\n\n3.  **Number of Stars within a Distance d**: Since the star density ρ is constant, the total number of stars (N) within this sphere of radius *d* is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    d = 1 / plx\n    (Here, distance *d* is in parsecs, and parallax *plx* is in arcseconds).\n\n5.  **Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax**: We can substitute the expression for distance (*d*) into our equation for the number of stars (N):\n    N = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³\n    N = (4/3)πρ / plx³\n\n    This equation tells us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a given value `plx`.\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with parallax. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of N with respect to parallax, or the derivative dN/d(plx).\n\n    Let's find the number of stars, *dN*, within a small shell of thickness *dd* at a distance *d*. The volume of this thin shell, *dV*, is approximately the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n    The number of stars in this shell is:\n    dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd\n\n    Now, we need to express this in terms of parallax. We use the relations d = 1/plx and its derivative, dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx). We are interested in the number of stars in a range, so we consider the magnitude: |dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx).\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for *dN*:\n    dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n7.  **Final Relationship**: To find the number of stars per unit parallax range, we look at the term dN/d(plx):\n    dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\n    Since 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\n    This relationship is a foundational concept in star-count analysis and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, where the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution shows that the probability density of a star having a certain parallax is proportional to 1/p⁴.\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
