    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Interpretation of IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The broad band at **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of the C=O stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** suggest the presence of a C=C bond within an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound (X) is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, significantly downfield, corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each for two protons, are characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals will define the structure of the alkyl substituent:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH3 group adjacent to a -CH2 group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH3 group adjacent to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to a -CH2 group, likely positioned between the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine group (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is a -CH group, which is attached to the benzene ring and also bonded to the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   Assembling the alkyl group: A methine (-CH) is attached to the ring. This -CH is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). This structure is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkanes. The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The reaction proceeds as follows: The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n    *   The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option A)\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group.\n    *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Option D)\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
