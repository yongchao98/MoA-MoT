    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided chemical reactions, the major products are determined as follows:\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically bulky. It will deprotonate the starting ketone to form an enolate.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen) and has one acidic hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, forming an enolate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to the C6 position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product is `2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`. To name this according to the options, the propanoate chain is treated as the parent, with the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent at its C3 position. The IUPAC naming rules require numbering the substituent ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6). To give the functional groups the lowest possible numbers, the carbonyl group (oxo) becomes position 2, and the ethyl/methyl-substituted carbon becomes position 3. This leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction, involving a nitroalkane as the nucleophile donor.\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate) `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. To name this, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group, which is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)–C(2)H₂–C(3)H(CH₃)–C(4)H(NO₂)–C(5)H₂–C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
