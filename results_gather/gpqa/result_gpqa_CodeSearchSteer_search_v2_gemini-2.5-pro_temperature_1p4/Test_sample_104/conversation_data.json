    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as the described star with dark spots, we must first calculate the brightness drop caused by the spots and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### Step 1: Calculating the Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of a star is related to its flux, which is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, where the flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff): F ∝ T_eff⁴.\n\nThe star has the following characteristics:\n*   **Effective Temperature (Teff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot Temperature (Tspot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spotted Hemisphere:** One hemisphere is 20% covered by dark spots.\n*   **Unspotted Hemisphere:** The other hemisphere is immaculate.\n\nThe maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature of 6000 K, is facing the observer. We can normalize this flux to 1.\n\nThe minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view. This hemisphere's surface consists of 80% photosphere (6000 K) and 20% spots (5000 K). The total flux is a weighted average of the flux from these two components:\n\n*   **Flux from photosphere (F_phot):** ∝ (6000 K)⁴\n*   **Flux from spots (F_spot):** ∝ (5000 K)⁴\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) relative to the maximum flux (F_max) is:\n\nF_min / F_max = [0.8 × (6000)⁴ + 0.2 × (5000)⁴] / (6000)⁴\nF_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 × (5000 / 6000)⁴\nF_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 × (5/6)⁴\nF_min / F_max ≈ 0.8 + 0.2 × 0.4823\nF_min / F_max ≈ 0.8 + 0.09646\nF_min / F_max ≈ 0.89646\n\nThe amplitude of the signal, which is the fractional drop in brightness, is:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\nAmplitude ≈ 1 - 0.89646 = 0.10354\n\n### Step 2: Equating to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, the depth of the transit (the drop in brightness) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is given by the formula:\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWhere:\n*   **R_pl** is the radius of the planet.\n*   **R_star** is the radius of the star.\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10354\n\n### Step 3: Solving for the Relative Radius\n\nFinally, we solve for the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root of the amplitude:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10354\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
