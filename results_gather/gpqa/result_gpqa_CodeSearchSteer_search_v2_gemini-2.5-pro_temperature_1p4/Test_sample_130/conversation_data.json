    "This is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying the reactants and products, understanding the reaction mechanism and its stereochemical outcome, and interpreting NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene containing dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This spectroscopic data is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give a single ¹H peak (in the typical range for vinylic protons), while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction and Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a quintessential **Diels-Alder reaction**, where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile. This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction typically forms two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The formation of major and minor products aligns with this expectation.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula Discrepancy:** There is a discrepancy between the stated molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) and the formula calculated from the reactants (Maleic Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ + Diene C₉H₁₂ = C₁₃H₁₄O₃). This is likely a typo in the problem statement. The core of the problem relies on the structure of the reactants and the principles of stereochemistry and NMR, so we proceed by assuming the named reactants are correct and the product is C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry and the \"Endo Rule\":** The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile usually favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (the \"endo rule\"). This product forms faster and is known as the kinetic product. However, the *exo* product is often more sterically stable (the thermodynamic product). In this specific case, the diene has two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These methyl groups cause significant steric hindrance with the approaching maleic anhydride in the *endo* transition state. This steric clash can override the electronic preference for the *endo* product, leading to the *exo* product being formed faster and thus becoming the major product.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the NOESY Spectra:** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peak indicates that two protons (or sets of protons) are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We must therefore identify a proton interaction that is unique to the *exo* adduct (the major product).\n\n    *   In the **exo adduct**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This geometry brings the protons of the anhydride portion (let's call them **H-c**, a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) close to the vinylic methyl groups (the two methyl groups attached to the double bond).\n    *   In the **endo adduct** (the minor product), the anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, far from the vinylic methyls. Instead, the anhydride protons would be close to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Assigning the NMR Signals and Identifying the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The two equivalent protons from the maleic anhydride moiety (**H-c**) are expected to appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The product has two sets of methyl groups: two equivalent *vinylic* methyls and two equivalent *bridgehead* methyls. Vinylic methyl groups are typically shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than aliphatic methyls. Therefore, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is assigned to the vinylic methyls, while another 6H singlet for the bridgehead methyls would be expected at a higher field (e.g., ~1 ppm).\n    *   Since the major product is the *exo* adduct, the distinctive NOESY cross-peak connects the protons that are spatially close in this isomer: the anhydride protons (H-c) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
