    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of symmetry like a spheroid oscillating along its z-axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The behavior of the radiation from such a dipole provides the answer to the question.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` relative to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case). The relationship is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated in the direction where `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the axis of oscillation). Therefore, the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we evaluate `sin²(30°)`:\n\n*   `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n*   `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThus, the power radiated at 30° is `A * (1/4)`. The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is **1/4**.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is also dependent on the frequency (and thus, the wavelength) of the oscillation. The power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`. This relationship is expressed as:\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSince the angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` are related by `ω = 2πc/λ` (where c is the speed of light), we can determine the dependence on `λ`:\n\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴` or `P ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is famously known as the basis for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n1.  The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  The radiated power per unit solid angle, as a function of wavelength, is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
