    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed based on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. To determine which of the listed symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze each one:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a local quantum field theory designed to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be scalars under Lorentz transformations. This symmetry is a foundational requirement.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. As a cornerstone of any relativistic quantum field theory, Poincaré symmetry must be respected by the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):** The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, which have been experimentally observed. SMEFT, as an extension, must be able to accommodate these known violations and also parameterize potential new sources of CP violation from physics at higher energy scales. Consequently, SMEFT contains many operators that are CP-violating (or CP-odd), meaning CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal):** According to the CPT theorem, any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant local effective field theory, it is built to respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
