    "Here is a breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6)** is propene (CH3-CH=CH2).\n*   **Compound B** is formed by the bromination of propene in carbon tetrachloride. This is an electrophilic addition reaction that yields 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)).\n*   **Compound C** is formed when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Using a strong base like alcoholic KOH results in the elimination of two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne. Therefore, compound C is propyne (CH3-Câ‰¡CH).\n*   **Compound D** is produced by passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube at 873 K. This process causes cyclic trimerization, where three molecules of propyne react to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene.\n*   **Compound E** is formed when mesitylene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is characteristic of nitration (conc. HNO3 and conc. H2SO4). The product is 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene.\n*   **Compound F** is formed by the reduction of the nitro group in compound E using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This reaction yields 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as mesidine).\n*   **Compound G** is formed when 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (F) reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl). This is a diazotization reaction, which produces the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.\n*   **Compound H** is formed when the diazonium salt (G) reacts with sodium hydroxide. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, a reaction known as hydroxy-de-diazoniation, to form 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.** Compound C is propyne. Propyne is indeed a flammable gas at standard temperature and pressure. This statement is correct.\n\n**B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.** Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine). Aromatic amines are key intermediates in the synthesis of azo dyes. 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, in particular, is used as a precursor for dyes. This statement is correct.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.** Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the three protons on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent and will appear as one singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and will produce a second singlet. Thus, the spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.** Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, green, or blue color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex. While the color can vary, a yellow color is generally indicative of a negative test or is not the typical result for phenols. In the case of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the ortho and para positions relative to the hydroxyl group are blocked by bulky methyl groups. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with ferric chloride. Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give the characteristic positive test (violet/blue/green color) with ferric chloride. The statement that it gives a yellow color is incorrect.\n\nThe incorrect statement is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
