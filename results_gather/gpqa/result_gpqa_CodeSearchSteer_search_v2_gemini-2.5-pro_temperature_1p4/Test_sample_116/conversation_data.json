    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each must be assessed for chirality, which is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. However, in this specific molecule, all four positions adjacent to this single bond (the ortho positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups and two methoxycarbonyl groups). This steric hindrance severely restricts rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule cannot easily become planar and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. To determine its chirality, we examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable, and thus it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses planes of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. However, it's worth noting that some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be forced into a chiral conformation, but benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with methoxycarbonyl groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (*cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
