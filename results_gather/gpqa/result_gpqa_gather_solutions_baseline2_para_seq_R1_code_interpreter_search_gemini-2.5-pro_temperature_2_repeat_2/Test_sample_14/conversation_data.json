They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P_2 = 3 * P_1\n2.  The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star: M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: R_star_1 = R_star_2\n\nSubstituting the radius information (R_star_1 = R_star_2) into our ratio equation, we get:\nRatio = (1) * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1\n\nThis means the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\nP^2 / a^3 = 4π^2 / (G * M_star)\nRearranging for 'a', we get:\na^3 = (G * M_star * P^2) / (4π^2)\na = ( (G * M_star * P^2) / (4π^2) )^(1/3)\n\nSince G and 4π^2 are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\na ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can set up the ratio for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * P_2^2) / (M_star_1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (P_2 = 3 * P_1 and M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2):\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_star_2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_star_2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n\nCancel out the common terms M_star_2 and P_1^2:\na_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\na_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096\n\nSince the probability ratio is equal to a_2 / a_1, we have:\nRatio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe transit probability for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$):\n$p_{transit} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, we can relate the semi-major axis to the orbital period ($P$) and the mass of the host star ($M_s$). Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, the law can be written as:\n$P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$\n\nSolving for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$a \\propto (M_s P^2)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $a$ back into the transit probability formula:\n$p_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_s}{(M_s P^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nTo compare the probabilities of Planet_1 ($p_1$) and Planet_2 ($p_2$), we can set up a ratio:\n$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s1} / (M_{s1} P_1^2)^{1/3}}{R_{s2} / (M_{s2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nLet's use the information given in the problem:\n1.  The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n3.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$.\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the ratio:\n$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{s2} / ( (2 M_{s2}) (P_2 / 3)^2 )^{1/3}}{R_{s2} / (M_{s2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nWe can cancel out $R_{s2}$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{(M_{s2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}{( (2 M_{s2}) (P_2^2 / 9) )^{1/3}}$\n\nNow, we can cancel the common terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_2^2$ inside the cube root:\n$\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{(1)^{1/3}}{(2/9)^{1/3}} = (\\frac{1}{2/9})^{1/3} = (\\frac{9}{2})^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\nCalculating the value:\n$(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$\n\nThis means the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the calculation performed, the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that Planet_1 is preferred for observation because it has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. This directly corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core of the question is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and determine which one is higher and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P_transit = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`P_1_transit`) to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (`P_2_transit`).\n    `Ratio = P_1_transit / P_2_transit`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:** Let's list the relationships given in the problem:\n    *   Orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`  or `P_2 / P_1 = 3`.\n    *   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` or `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`.\n    *   Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` or `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio Formula:** Since `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`, our ratio formula simplifies to:\n    `Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n    To find the probability ratio, we now need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n6.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The law states:\n    `P^2 / a^3 ∝ 1 / M_s`\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_1 / a_2`):**\n    `a_1 / a_2 = [ (P_1^2 * M_s1) / (P_2^2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n    We can group the terms:\n    `a_1 / a_2 = [ (P_1 / P_2)^2 * (M_s1 / M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n    Now, substitute the known values: `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3` and `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`.\n    `a_1 / a_2 = [ (1/3)^2 * 2 ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_1 / a_2 = [ (1/9) * 2 ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_1 / a_2 = (2/9)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Probability Ratio:** We found earlier that `Ratio = a_2 / a_1`. This is the inverse of the ratio we just calculated.\n    `Ratio = 1 / (a_1 / a_2) = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** The previous Python code execution provided the numerical result for this calculation.\n    `Ratio ≈ 1.65096`\n\n10. **Formulate the Conclusion:** The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is approximately 1.65.

The radii of the host stars are the same: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$.\n2.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}P_2$.\n3.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}$.\n\nSubstituting $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$ into our ratio equation, it simplifies to:\n$\\frac{P_{t1}}{P_{t2}} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law.

This means the ratio `R_star1 / R_star2 = 1`. The equation simplifies to:\n`p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a_2 / a_1`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) and semi-major axis (`a`) to the mass of its host star (`M_star`):\n`a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`a ∝ (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the periods and stellar masses:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_star2) / (P_1^2 * M_star1) ]^(1/3)`\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1.

Transit Probability Formula**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a random orbital inclination and a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius ($R_*$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$p_{transit} = \\frac{R_*}{a}$\n\n### **2. Using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe are not given the semi-major axis ($a$) directly. However, we can relate it to the orbital period ($P$) and the host star's mass ($M_*$) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet whose mass is much smaller than its star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_*$), the law is:\n\n$P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_*}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$a^3 \\propto M_* P^2$\n$a \\propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **3. Combining the Formulas**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $a$ back into the transit probability formula:\n\n$p_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_*}{(M_* P^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nThis shows how the transit probability depends on the given physical parameters of the system.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare Planet_1 and Planet_2, we'll calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}}$:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = \\frac{R_{*,1} / (M_{*,1} P_1^2)^{1/3}}{R_{*,2} / (M_{*,2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{*,1}}{R_{*,2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{*,2} P_2^2}{M_{*,1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **5. Substituting the Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in the relationships provided in the problem:\n\n*   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii, so $R_{*,1} = R_{*,2}$. This makes the ratio $\\frac{R_{*,1}}{R_{*,2}} = 1$.\n*   **Stellar Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2, so $M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2}$.\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2, so $P_1 = P_2 / 3$. Therefore, $P_1^2 = (P_2 / 3)^2 = P_2^2 / 9$.\n\nSubstituting these into our ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = (1) \\left(\\frac{M_{*,2} P_2^2}{(2 M_{*,2}) (P_2^2 / 9)}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **6. Simplifying and Solving**\n\nThe terms $M_{*,2}$ and $P_2^2$ cancel out from the numerator and denominator:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\times (1/9)}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2/9}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation of $(4.5)^{1/3}$:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} \\approx 1.65$\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe result shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

We need to find the ratio of their probabilities (`p_1 / p_2`).\n\n*   **Step 2: Recall the Transit Probability Formula**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   Probability formula: `p = R_s / a`\n\n*   **Step 3: Set up the Probability Ratio**\n    We can write the probabilities for each planet and then find their ratio:\n    *   Probability for Planet_1: `p_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   Probability for Planet_2: `p_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    *   Ratio: `p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the Given Information about the Stars' Radii**\n    The problem states that both host stars have the same radii, meaning `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   This simplifies the ratio because `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   Simplified ratio: `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n    To find which planet has a higher transit probability, we now need to determine the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Use Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The law can be written as:\n    `P^2 / a^3 = constant / M_s`  or  `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    From this, we can solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 5, we can set up the ratio for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 7: Substitute the Known Relationships**\n    The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3` (Period of Planet_1 is three times shorter)\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (Mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2)\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 8: Simplify the Expression**\n    Simplify the terms inside the cube root:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_2^2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n\n    The `M_s2` and `P_2^2` terms appear in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 9: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Since we found that `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we just need to compute the value of `(4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    The code output provided shows:\n    `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n    This means that `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`, or `p_1 ≈ 1.65 * p_2`.\n\n*   **Step 10: Conclusion**\n    The probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

For circular orbits, the formula is:\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following information:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\nUsing the fact that `R_s1 = R_s2`, the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` becomes 1. Our ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_s`), assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (`m_p << M_s`):\n`P^2 = (4π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n`a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4π^2)`\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\nNow, we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (`P_2 = 3 * P_1` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`) into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nCancel the common terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Consequently, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe transit probability is given by the formula P = R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the host star and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to compare the probability of Planet_1 (P1) with that of Planet_2 (P2):\nRatio = P1 / P2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n\nGiven that both host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2), the formula simplifies to:\nRatio = a2 / a1\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law:\nP^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star  => a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the ratio a2 / a1 can be written as:\na2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)\n\nNow, we substitute the given information:\n*   M_s1 = 2 * M_s2\n*   P1 = P2 / 3  => P1^2 = P2^2 / 9\n\na2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * (P2^2 / 9)) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe terms M_s2 and P2^2 cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\n(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nSince the probability ratio (P1 / P2) is equal to a2 / a1, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

This means calculating the ratio `p_transit1 / p_transit2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis.\n    `p_transit = R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Planets:**\n    *   For Planet_1: `p_transit1 = R_star1 / a_1`\n    *   For Planet_2: `p_transit2 = R_star2 / a_2`\n\n    The ratio of the probabilities is:\n    `p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (R_star1 / a_1) / (R_star2 / a_2) = (R_star1 / R_star2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`.\n    *   This simplifies the ratio to: `p_transit1 / p_transit2 = a_2 / a_1`.\n\n5.  **Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** To find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, I need to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the given parameters: orbital period (`P`) and host star mass (`M_star`). Kepler's Third Law provides this relationship.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    `P^2 / a^3 = 4 * π^2 / (G * (M_star + M_planet))`\n    Since the planets are Earth-like, their mass (`M_planet`) is negligible compared to the star's mass (`M_star`). So, `M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star`.\n    `P^2 / a^3 ≈ 4 * π^2 / (G * M_star)`\n\n    Rearranging for `a`:\n    `a^3 ≈ (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a ≈ [ (G / (4 * π^2)) * M_star * P^2 ]^(1/3)`\n\n    Since `G` and `4 * π^2` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star2 * P_2^2) / (M_star1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_star2 / M_star1)^(1/3) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Specific Values Given in the Problem:**\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3  =>  P_2 / P_1 = 3`\n    *   `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2  =>  M_star2 / M_star1 = 1/2`\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (1 * 3^2)^(1/3) / (2^(1/3))`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9)^(1/3) / (2^(1/3))`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    The ratio of probabilities is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `p_transit1 / p_transit2 = a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find the numerical value, I will use a calculator.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities\n    # p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n    ratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields approximately `1.65`.\n\n10. **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   `p_transit1 / p_transit2 ≈ 1.65`\n    *   This means `p_transit1 ≈ 1.65 * p_transit2`.\n    *   The transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n    *   Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n11. **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

However, it can be related to the orbital period ($P$) and the host star's mass ($M_*$) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet, its mass is negligible compared to the star's, so the law simplifies to $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_*}$. Solving for $a$, we get:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_* P^2$\n    $a \\propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n3.  **Express Probability in Terms of Given Variables:** By substituting the expression for $a$ into the probability formula, we find how the probability depends on the given parameters:\n    $p_{tr} \\propto \\frac{R_*}{(M_* P^2)^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio:** To compare the two planets, we'll calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_{tr,1} / p_{tr,2}$:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\frac{R_{*1} / (M_{*1} P_1^2)^{1/3}}{R_{*2} / (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{*1}}{R_{*2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{*2} P_2^2}{M_{*1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Information:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{*1} = R_{*2}$, so $\\frac{R_{*1}}{R_{*2}} = 1$.\n    *   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the other: $M_{*1} = 2 M_{*2}$, so $\\frac{M_{*2}}{M_{*1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, so $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 3$, and $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, substitute these values back into the ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = (1) \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot (9) \\right)^{1/3}$\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:** The code execution provided the value for $(4.5)^{1/3}$:\n    $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The result shows that $p_{tr,1} \\approx 1.65 \\times p_{tr,2}$.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P_2 = 3 * P_1\n2.  The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star: M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: R_star_1 = R_star_2\n\nSubstituting the radius information (R_star_1 = R_star_2) into our ratio equation, we get:\nRatio = (1) * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1\n\nThis means the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\nP^2 / a^3 = 4π^2 / (G * M_star)\nRearranging for 'a', we get:\na^3 = (G * M_star * P^2) / (4π^2)\na = ( (G * M_star * P^2) / (4π^2) )^(1/3)\n\nSince G and 4π^2 are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\na ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can set up the ratio for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * P_2^2) / (M_star_1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (P_2 = 3 * P_1 and M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2):\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_star_2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_star_2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_star_2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n\nCancel out the common terms M_star_2 and P_1^2:\na_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\na_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096\n\nSince the probability ratio is equal to a_2 / a_1, we have:\nRatio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting.

Using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nWe are not given the semi-major axis ($a$) directly. However, we can relate it to the orbital period ($P$) and the host star's mass ($M_*$) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet whose mass is much smaller than its star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_*$), the law is:\n\n$P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_*}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$a^3 \\propto M_* P^2$\n$a \\propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n### **3. Combining the Formulas**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $a$ back into the transit probability formula:\n\n$p_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_*}{(M_* P^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nThis shows how the transit probability depends on the given physical parameters of the system.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities**\n\nTo compare Planet_1 and Planet_2, we'll calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}}$:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = \\frac{R_{*,1} / (M_{*,1} P_1^2)^{1/3}}{R_{*,2} / (M_{*,2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{*,1}}{R_{*,2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{*,2} P_2^2}{M_{*,1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **5. Substituting the Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in the relationships provided in the problem:\n\n*   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii, so $R_{*,1} = R_{*,2}$. This makes the ratio $\\frac{R_{*,1}}{R_{*,2}} = 1$.\n*   **Stellar Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2, so $M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2}$.\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2, so $P_1 = P_2 / 3$. Therefore, $P_1^2 = (P_2 / 3)^2 = P_2^2 / 9$.\n\nSubstituting these into our ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{p_{transit,1}}{p_{transit,2}} = (1) \\left(\\frac{M_{*,2} P_2^2}{(2 M_{*,2}) (P_2^2 / 9)}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **6.

The law can be written as:\n    `P^2 / a^3 = constant / M_s`  or  `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n    From this, we can solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Using the proportionality from Step 5, we can set up the ratio for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 7: Substitute the Known Relationships**\n    The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   `P_1 = P_2 / 3` (Period of Planet_1 is three times shorter)\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (Mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2)\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 8: Simplify the Expression**\n    Simplify the terms inside the cube root:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_2^2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n\n    The `M_s2` and `P_2^2` terms appear in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Step 9: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Since we found that `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`, we just need to compute the value of `(4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    The code output provided shows:\n    `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n    This means that `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`, or `p_1 ≈ 1.65 * p_2`.\n\n*   **Step 10: Conclusion**\n    The probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\nUsing the fact that `R_s1 = R_s2`, the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` becomes 1. Our ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_s`), assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (`m_p << M_s`):\n`P^2 = (4π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n`a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4π^2)`\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\nNow, we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (`P_2 = 3 * P_1` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`) into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nCancel the common terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

However, it can be related to the orbital period ($P$) and the host star's mass ($M_*$) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet, its mass is negligible compared to the star's, so the law simplifies to $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_*}$. Solving for $a$, we get:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_* P^2$\n    $a \\propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n3.  **Express Probability in Terms of Given Variables:** By substituting the expression for $a$ into the probability formula, we find how the probability depends on the given parameters:\n    $p_{tr} \\propto \\frac{R_*}{(M_* P^2)^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio:** To compare the two planets, we'll calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities, $p_{tr,1} / p_{tr,2}$:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\frac{R_{*1} / (M_{*1} P_1^2)^{1/3}}{R_{*2} / (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}}$\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{*1}}{R_{*2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{*2} P_2^2}{M_{*1} P_1^2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Information:** The problem provides the following relationships:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{*1} = R_{*2}$, so $\\frac{R_{*1}}{R_{*2}} = 1$.\n    *   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the other: $M_{*1} = 2 M_{*2}$, so $\\frac{M_{*2}}{M_{*1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, so $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 3$, and $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, substitute these values back into the ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = (1) \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot (9) \\right)^{1/3}$\n    $\\frac{p_{tr,1}}{p_{tr,2}} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:** The code execution provided the value for $(4.5)^{1/3}$:\n    $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The result shows that $p_{tr,1} \\approx 1.65 \\times p_{tr,2}$.
