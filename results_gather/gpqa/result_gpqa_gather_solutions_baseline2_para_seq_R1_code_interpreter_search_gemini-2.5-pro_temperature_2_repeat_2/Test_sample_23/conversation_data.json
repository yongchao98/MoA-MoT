This is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction can be expressed as: `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use atomic masses of H=1 and C=12.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is a very close match. So, let's assume `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed from hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, despite being unsaturated, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions due to its aromatic stability.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y1 (cyclohexane) does not react. Y2 must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it could be another saturated C6 isomer or an aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer like methylcyclopentane, severe hydrogenation would cause ring-opening to form alkanes (like n-hexane or methylpentane), not just cyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only* Z is formed.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12`.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. Since the products are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 on both sides.\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can balance the atoms.\n    *   Carbon: C atoms in (X1 + X2) = C atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Hydrogen: H atoms in (X1 + X2) = H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 must have a six-carbon ring structure. So, their formulas are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   We know `x + y = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Non-conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds, which are not conjugated.\n    *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated bonds, so it is ruled out).\n*   Let's test if these two compounds fit our hydrogen count:\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n    `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n    In this reaction, the diene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2H. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   We can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For a saturated hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   Let's calculate the mass fraction of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of CnH2n ≈ 12n + 2n = 14n\n    *   Mass of hydrogen = 2n\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (14n) = 2/14 = 1/7\n*   Converting 1/7 to a percentage: (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let Y = (Cyclohexane + Compound D).\n    *   Cyclohexane does not react with hydrogen.\n    *   So, hydrogenation of Compound D must produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Compound D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n*   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would have a different carbon skeleton. While severe hydrogenation might cause rearrangement, a more direct interpretation is needed.\n*   Let's consider D being an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions but can be hydrogenated.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, severe)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a well-known reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane would yield only cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst:\n    A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for the reaction:\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    H(A) + H(B) = H(Benzene) + H(Cyclohexane)\n    H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18\n*   Now we need to find two unsaturated C6-ring compounds (A and B) that are not conjugated and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has 10 H atoms. It is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8): Has 8 H atoms, but its double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has 8 H atoms. Its double bonds are separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's see if A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene fit the criteria.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = H(C6H10) + H(C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n    *   The reaction would be:\n        C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible disproportionation (catalytic hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the chemical formula and structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass.\n*   Using Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, `1/7 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds. This means Z must be a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This implies that all the compounds in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   As we will see later, the reaction involves benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12). This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane: `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437`, which is close enough to 14.28% considering rounding. The `y=2x` derivation is more definitive.\n*   Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent, which matches the description.\n\n**2. Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. So, let C = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This means D must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   D must not decolorize bromine water. This rules out unsaturated compounds like cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes. This leaves saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Since D must be different from C (cyclohexane), the only plausible candidate is an aromatic compound: benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the components of mixture X.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   The overall transformation is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). The total number of C and H atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total atoms in products: C = 6+6=12, H = 12+6=18.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must together contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   Now let's use the properties of mixture X:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, confirming the C6 ring skeleton for both A and B.\n*   Let's identify possible structures for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond, not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 10).\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two double bonds, but they are conjugated. The problem statement explicitly excludes this.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 8).\n*   Let's test the pair A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction stoichiometry.\n*   All other conditions are met: equimolar mixture of two C6-ring liquids, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and the reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` represents a valid hydrogen transfer.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, which can be either an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's test the general formulas using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2).\n        If we set this to 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7), we get:\n        (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7\n        7 * (2n + 2) = 1 * (14n + 2)\n        14n + 14 = 14n + 2\n        14 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkane.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7.\n        1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. This is a match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. This fits the general formula CnH2n for n=6. We can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid in Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has the same six-carbon cyclic skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot have any C=C double bonds in a ring or side chain. The only remaining possibility for a C6 cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with aqueous bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B contain one or more C=C double bonds.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall reaction is:\n    A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Since the products have a C6 ring, and hydrogenation of X also yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6. The reactants A and B must collectively have C12H18 (12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms). Since A and B are both C6 compounds, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the components of mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H). This is a valid hydrogen transfer.\n*   The final condition is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated, non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12): `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula and H percentage:\n        *   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n with n=6.\n        *   %H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches perfectly.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (components A and B) and mixture Y (components C and D) under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means that hydrogenation of each of the four substances (A, B, C, D) must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   This implies that all four substances A, B, C, and D must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring. Any side chains or different ring structures would yield different products upon hydrogenation. For example, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane yields methylcyclopentane, not cyclohexane (though isomerization can occur under specific reforming conditions, the problem implies a common skeleton for all precursors).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say **C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   What is D? D must also have a C6 ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation must yield cyclohexane. It also must not decolorize bromine water. The most common chemical species that fits this description is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This mixture Y is formed by a \"disproportionation\" reaction when mixture X is heated with platinum. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A+B) -> Mixture Y (C+D)`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total composition of A+B must be C12H18.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. Both must have a C6-ring skeleton. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From `A+B = C12H18`, we have `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation issue.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8). It has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement `x+y=18`.\n    *   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --Pt, heat--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced by gaining 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is oxidized by losing 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   Thus, **Mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene) and one molecule of the second liquid (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Calculating `1/7` as a percentage gives `(1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%`. This is a perfect match for the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a liquid widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen (it's saturated). The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of Y must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component, Y₂, must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only common C₆ compound that is not an alkene but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) is converted into mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) through a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   We are also told that hydrogenating mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ are C₆ hydrocarbons with a ring structure, which become C₆H₁₂ upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   The reaction involves molecules that all have 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by applying the law of conservation of mass to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(For a complete picture, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). They both decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) * 100`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the fraction of hydrogen mass is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 100/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for CnH2n using integer masses:\n        `Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) * 100 = 2n / 14n * 100 = (1/7) * 100 = 14.2857...%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now and check if it fits all other conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let mixture Y = {Y1, Y2}. We can set Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenating Y, which is {Cyclohexane, Y2}, gives only Cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating Y2 must also yield Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that fit the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both X1 and X2 have a six-membered ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2 (equimolar)\n        Substituting our findings:\n        X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gaining hydrogen) and the other is dehydrogenated (losing hydrogen). To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H12) + H_atoms(C6H6)\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton, they must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes.\n        *   Cyclohexane: C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8\n    *   We need two different compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only possible combination is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene has only one double bond. For the cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --[Pt, heat]--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). Alkanes have the formula C_n H_{2n+2}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This means D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenating D must therefore also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z but be unsaturated. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a typical alkene or alkyne. This strongly indicates that D is an aromatic compound (an arene). Aromatic compounds only react with hydrogen under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) and do not react with bromine water.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n}, and D is the corresponding aromatic compound (arene) with the formula C_n H_{2n-6} (for a single benzene ring structure).\n    *   This structure requires n ≥ 6, as the smallest aromatic ring is benzene (C₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z. This means both A and B, when hydrogenated, form Z. Thus, A and B must also have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and D. They must be cycloalkenes or cyclodienes.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   Since A and B are cycloalkenes/dienes that form the cycloalkane Z, and D is an aromatic compound, the most logical composition for A and B is one cycloalkene and one cyclodiene.\n        *   Let A be the cycloalkene: C_n H_{2n-2}.\n        *   Let B be the cyclodiene: C_n H_{2n-4}.\n    *   The reaction becomes: C_n H_{2n-2} (A) + C_n H_{2n-4} (B) → C_n H_{2n} (Z) + C_n H_{2n-6} (D).\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: Left side = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. Right side = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n        *   The cycloalkene (A) is hydrogenated to the cycloalkane (Z), and the cyclodiene (B) is dehydrogenated to the aromatic compound (D). This is a plausible disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) that produces an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X.\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. This means the cyclodiene (B) must have isolated double bonds (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in A and B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The problem is constructed such that the answer should be one of the options. Let's test the options that correspond to integer values of n.\n        *   A) 18: If 4n-6 = 18, then 4n = 24, which gives n=6. This is a valid solution.\n        *   B) 12: If 4n-6 = 12, then 4n = 18, which gives n=4.5 (not an integer).\n        *   C) 22: If 4n-6 = 22, then 4n = 28, which gives n=7. This is also a valid solution.\n        *   D) 16: If 4n-6 = 16, then 4n = 22, which gives n=5.5 (not an integer).\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Scenario n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), D is benzene (C₆H₆). A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), and B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Scenario n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), D is toluene (C₇H₈). A is methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), and B is a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀). Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of further information, chemistry problems of this type usually refer to the most fundamental parent compounds. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the quintessential example of this type of chemistry, often used as the primary illustration in textbooks. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's find the ratio of moles of H to C. Assuming 100g of substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   Alternatively, using the approximation C=12 and H=1, a mass fraction of H of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CnHx, the mass fraction of H is `x / (12n + x)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7x = 12n + x`, which simplifies to `6x = 12n`, or `x = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). An acyclic saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane (CnH2n+2), and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids, let's call them C and D, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds. However, aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions, so they are a possibility.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) naturally gives Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. If D were a saturated isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane is to cyclohexane), this would be possible via isomerization under severe conditions. However, a more elegant solution exists if we consider aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are \"unsaturated\" in structure but \"saturated\" in the bromine water test. They readily hydrogenate to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that D is the aromatic derivative corresponding to the cycloalkane Z.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D would be benzene (C6H6).\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D would be toluene (C7H8).\n    *   This hypothesis is strong because hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Thus, hydrogenation of Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene} gives only methylcyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids, A and B, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton, and this skeleton is that of Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n\n4.  **Construct the Reaction**\n    *   Let's combine our findings. We have a reaction where A and B react to form C and D in a 1:1 ratio.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Let's test the C6 case: Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane (C), benzene (D)}. So C = C6H12 and D = C6H6.\n        *   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. To balance atoms, A and B must be C6 compounds, and the total atom count must match. The products have C12 and H18. So A+B must be C12H18.\n        *   Since A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring. Let's find two such compounds whose formulas sum to C12H18. The most plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `C6H10 + C6H8` gives C12H18. This matches.\n        *   The specific diene must be non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. So, B must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n        *   Let's propose the final set of compounds:\n            *   X = {cyclohexene (A, C6H10), cyclohexa-1,4-diene (B, C6H8)}\n            *   Y = {cyclohexane (C, C6H12), benzene (D, C6H6)}\n            *   Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem perfectly. The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known type of hydrogen transfer reaction, driven by the formation of the stable aromatic ring, and it qualifies as a disproportionation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*(Self-correction: A similar consistent scenario can be constructed for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane), leading to a total H count of 22. However, the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of transformation, making it the most likely intended answer in a chemistry problem of this nature.)*\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (y * mass_H) / (x * mass_C + y * mass_H).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n        y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n        7y = 12x + y\n        6y = 12x\n        y = 2x\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. Alkenes react with hydrogen (hydrogenation), but saturated cycloalkanes do not (under most conditions). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the mass percent for C6H12 with more precise atomic masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.01):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.01 = 12.12\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.01 = 72.06\n        Total Mass = 84.18\n        %H = (12.12 / 84.18) * 100% ≈ 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. The y=2x relationship is very strong.\n    *   The entire reaction scheme involves conversions that give a single product Z upon hydrogenation. This strongly implies all key compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the C6 skeleton of cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating it gives itself.\n    *   Now for substance D: It must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), meaning it has a C6 skeleton. It must not decolorize bromine water. The most common compound fitting this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of liquids A and B) is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it implies a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as a 1:1 reaction between the components of the equimolar mixture X to form the components of the equimolar mixture Y:\n        A + B → C + D\n        A + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   All compounds (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton. Let the formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation:\n        Number of H in (A + B) = Number of H in (C6H12 + C6H6)\n        a + b = 12 + 6\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is a + b, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does mixture X decolorize bromine water? This means A or B (or both) must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Are there no conjugated multiple bonds in X?\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for A and B. We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) with a total of 18 hydrogens. A good candidate pair would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   a = 10, b = 8. So a + b = 18. This fits.\n        *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This fits the condition. 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be ruled out because it is conjugated.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: C6H10 (acceptor) + C6H8 (donor) → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a known type of reaction.\n    *   The existence of this plausible pair confirms our reasoning is sound. The core calculation (a+b=18) is independent of finding the exact structures but is reinforced by it.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28% = 0.1428\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   Molar ratio C:H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) = 7.13 : 14.17 ≈ 1:2.\n*   The empirical formula is CH2.\n*   The molecular formula of a stable hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and a liquid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   We know one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation, which in this context (Pt catalyst, formation of a saturated compound) implies a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One substance is hydrogenated (reduced) to Z, and another must be dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   For the resulting mixture Y to not decolorize bromine water, the dehydrogenated product must be stable and unreactive to Br2 water. The most common examples are aromatic compounds.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, which is formed upon its full hydrogenation.\n\n**3. Identify the Carbon Skeleton and the Components**\n*   The hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y yields *only* substance Z. This is a crucial point that confirms all compounds in X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's consider the most common example of this type of reaction, which involves a six-membered ring.\n    *   If n=6, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, is a very common solvent, and is a liquid.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B must both yield Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are unsaturated compounds with a C6H12 carbon skeleton. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n*   The transformation from X to Y is a reaction where the components of X form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction can be written as:\n    A + B → C6H6 + C6H12\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms must balance. Both A and B have 6 carbons, so the carbon atoms are balanced (6+6 → 6+6). Let the formula of A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. The hydrogen atoms must also balance:\n    x + y = 6 + 12\n    x + y = 18\n*   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B is 18.\n*   Let's find plausible identities for A and B.\n    *   They are unsaturated cyclohexanes. A stable unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbon can be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   If A is C6H10 and B is C6H8, then the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits our deduction.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The problem states there are *no conjugated multiple bonds* in the compounds of mixture X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids and will decolorize bromine water.\n\n**5. Final Verification**\n*   **X** = {C6H10, C6H8} (equimolar, liquids, unsaturated, non-conjugated). Check.\n*   **Reaction** X → Y: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated. It produces an equimolar mixture. Check.\n*   **Y** = {C6H12, C6H6} (equimolar, do not decolorize Br2 water). Check.\n*   **Z** = C6H12 (constituent of Y, widely used solvent, CnH2n, %H=14.28%). Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 and C6H8 both hydrogenate to C6H12. Gives only Z. Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H6 and C6H12 both yield C6H12 under hydrogenation. Gives only Z. Check.\n\nThe logic is consistent. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n\nNumber of H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=1, 4/16=25%. For large n, H% approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ): H% = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n        *   Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂): H% will be lower.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Relate all compounds via the carbon skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (compounds A and B) and mixture Y (compounds C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D, as well as Z itself, share the same carbon skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over a heated platinum catalyst. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum (a reaction known as Zelinzky irreversible catalysis) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated to form a stable aromatic system.\n    *   Substance Z is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) and is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since C is the hydrogenated product, its partner D must be the dehydrogenated product. The final, most stable dehydrogenated product of a cycloalkane skeleton is the corresponding aromatic compound.\n    *   Mixture Y = {a cycloalkane (Z), an aromatic compound}.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   Z would be **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent with formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n        *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (Z) and benzene**.\n        *   Let's check: Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Both are liquids. Neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits the description of Y perfectly. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, so hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This also fits.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D` must be balanced. With Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)}, the total formula of the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the reactants A+B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B must have the same C₆ ring skeleton. We are looking for two different unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated ring compounds (non-conjugated):\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: one double bond.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: two isolated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check the sum of their hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches exactly.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n        In this hydrogen transfer, the diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the monoene gains those 2H to become cyclohexane. This reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.\n\n5.  **Verify all conditions**\n    *   X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}. Equimolar mixture of two liquids. Both have C=C bonds, so they decolorize Br₂ water. 1,4-CHD has no conjugated bonds. ✓\n    *   Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Equimolar mixture formed from X. Both are liquids that do not decolorize Br₂ water. ✓\n    *   Z = C₆H₁₂. Has H% of 14.3%, is a constituent of Y, is a widely used solvent, is saturated. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of X ({C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y ({C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   All conditions are satisfied by this C₆-based system. An analogous C₇-based system {methylcyclohexene, methylcyclohexadiene} is also possible and would lead to an answer of 22, but the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `14.28%` is equivalent to `0.1428`, which is very close to the fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` => `7m = 12n + m` => `6m = 12n` => `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The crucial clue is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means that all reactive components in both mixtures must share the same carbon skeleton, which upon saturation, yields Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which typically means it contains saturated compounds (alkanes or cycloalkanes) and is not aromatic, or at least does not contain simple alkenes/alkynes.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. If Y consists of `Y1` and `Y2`, and `Y1 = Z`, then hydrogenation of `Y2` must also yield Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is transformed into mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in organic chemistry is typically a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen or gains oxygen) and reduced (gains hydrogen or loses oxygen). For hydrocarbons, this usually means hydrogen transfer.\n    *   So, some component(s) in X are reduced, and some are oxidized to form the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of X be `X1 (CnH_a)` and `X2 (CnH_b)`.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be `Y1 (CnH_c)` and `Y2 (CnH_d)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction stoichiometry is likely `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. `C(2n)H(a+b) → C(2n)H(c+d)`. This means `a + b = c + d`.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Mixture Y and a Key Interpretation**\n    *   Initially, one might assume that because Y is \"saturated,\" both components must be cycloalkanes (e.g., Y1=cyclohexane, Y2=methylcyclopentane). This would mean `c=d=2n`. This leads to `a+b = 4n`.\n    *   However, mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components are unsaturated. Thus, `a < 2n` and `b < 2n`. This leads to a contradiction: `a+b` must be less than `4n`.\n    *   This contradiction suggests a flaw in the interpretation. The key lies in the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this strictly means saturated, in the context of many chemistry problems, it's used to distinguish reactive alkenes/alkynes from the less reactive aromatic compounds. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). Let's test the hypothesis that one of the products in Y is aromatic.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer producing a cycloalkane and an aromatic ring.\n    *   Let `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Let `Y2` be the corresponding aromatic compound, `Cn H(n)` (e.g., if n=6, benzene C6H6). This fits the `m=n` for typical aromatic rings like benzene, though more accurately `C6H6` hydrogenates to `C6H12`. Let's test with `n=6`, which is the most common for these reactions.\n    *   So let's hypothesize: `Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   And `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`.\n    *   Let's check if this Y fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n        *   \"Does not decolorize bromine water\": Plausible under this interpretation.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Yes, this works.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Yes, cyclohexane is present.\n\n5.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   If `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`, the total formula of the products (`Y1+Y2`) is `C12H18`.\n    *   Therefore, the total formula of the reactants (`X1+X2`) must also be `C12H18`.\n    *   So, for `X1 (C6Ha)` and `X2 (C6Hb)`, we must have `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Now we need to find two different liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the remaining conditions:\n        *   They must be C6 compounds.\n        *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).\n        *   They must not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's choose a pair of molecules with `a+b=18`. A good candidate pair is one with 10 hydrogens and one with 8 hydrogens.\n        *   **X1 = C6H10**: A C6 alkene. **Cyclohexene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, not conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n        *   **X2 = C6H8**: A C6 diene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, we can't use cyclohexa-1,3-diene. However, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, non-conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   So, a viable composition for mixture X is `{cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene}`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction**\n    *   The proposed transformation is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This reaction is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Our calculated value is 18, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z (CxHy).\n        The mass fraction of H is given by: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`.\n        Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get: `0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)`.\n        This fraction is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   This formula corresponds to either an alkene (C=C bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane** with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z itself, which is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n). Let's call this Y1. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by \"disproportionation\" using a platinum catalyst and heat. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z. This means the other component of Y (let's call it Y2) must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon hydrogenation, Y2 becomes Z.\n    *   Since Y2 has the same carbon skeleton (a C-n ring) and must be formed by dehydrogenation, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The formula for a simple aromatic compound derived from a CnH2n cycloalkane is **CnH2n-6**. For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) is related to benzene (C6H6). Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is related to toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). Aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of **CnH2n** (Z) and **CnH2n-6** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components have C=C double bonds. They are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that X1 and X2 also have the same CnH- carbon skeleton as Z. They are therefore cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The problem states \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\". This gives a specific structural constraint.\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a 1:1 molar reaction, as an *equimolar* mixture X forms an *equimolar* mixture Y. This implies the stoichiometry is `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n        `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to CnH2n, while the other is oxidized to CnH2n-6. For this to work, X1 must be more hydrogenated than Y2 (the aromatic) and X2 must be more hydrogenated than Y2. Also, X1 must be less hydrogenated than Y1 (the cycloalkane). The most logical combination for X1 and X2, which are non-conjugated and have a CnH- skeleton, is a cycloalkene (**CnH2n-2**) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (**CnH2n-4**).\n\n4.  **Balance the Reaction and Find the Solution**\n    *   Let's check if this combination works:\n        `X1 (CnH2n-4) + X2 (CnH2n-2) -> Y1 (CnH2n) + Y2 (CnH2n-6)` (The order of X1, X2 is arbitrary).\n        This does not balance.\n    *   Let's rethink the hydrogen transfer. The overall process must be balanced. Let the hydrogen counts in X1 and X2 be `a` and `b`. The reaction is:\n        `CnH_a + CnH_b -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n        The hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to `a + b`. So we need to find the value of `4n - 6`.\n    *   We have to determine 'n'. The problem mentions Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) fit this description and the CnH2n formula with H% ≈ 14.3%. The reaction scheme is plausible for both. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and simplest example is usually intended. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent system for this type of chemistry. Let's assume **n=6**.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C6H12\n        *   Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   X must be an equimolar mixture of C6 compounds that can react to form Y. Based on our model:\n            *   `X1` would be a cyclohexadiene, C6H8. To be non-conjugated, it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n            *   `X2` would be a cyclohexene, C6H10. The only one is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   The reaction is: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in C6H8 and C6H10.\n        *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the formula `4n - 6`:\n        For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Check the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 18.\n    *   The given options are A) 18, B) 22, C) 16, D) 12.\n    *   Our result matches option A.\n\n    (Note: If we had chosen n=7, the total H atoms would be 4(7) - 6 = 22, which is option B. However, the C6 system is the most classic and fundamental example for this type of problem.)\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1.\n    *   For a general hydrocarbon `CnHm`, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Let's test the given percentage: 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let's see which hydrocarbon formula class fits `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula `CnH2n` corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenating other substances and that Z itself \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, while a cycloalkane is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula `CnH2n`.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z itself is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also hydrogenate to Z (`CnH2n`). This means Y2 must have the same carbon skeleton (n carbon atoms in a ring).\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which matches the problem description.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic ring structure is benzene (C6H6). If Y2 is benzene, then n=6.\n    *   This implies that `Z = C6H12` (cyclohexane) and `Y2 = C6H6` (benzene).\n    *   This is a very plausible scenario: Z=cyclohexane is a widely used solvent, and its hydrogenation gives itself. Y2=benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. A disproportionation is a redox reaction where a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (Pt catalyst), it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2 -> 1 molecule of Y1 + 1 molecule of Y2`.\n    *   Substituting the components of Y we identified: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have the same C6-ring carbon skeleton as cyclohexane. So their formulas are `C6Hx` and `C6Hy`.\n    *   Based on the principle of conservation of mass for the disproportionation reaction, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in X1) + (Number of H in X2) = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)`.\n    *   Total H in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended)**\n    *   Let's check if we can find plausible structures for X1 and X2.\n    *   `X1 = C6Hx`, `X2 = C6Hy`, with `x+y=18`.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Let's try `X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10)` and `X2 = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)`.\n        *   Does x+y=18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Does cyclohexene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does it have conjugated bonds? No, the double bonds at positions 1 and 4 are isolated. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the diene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is chemically reasonable over a Pt catalyst.\n    *   This successful identification of X1 and X2 confirms our stoichiometric calculation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   The hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CₓHᵧ.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using integer atomic masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Additionally, Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. The entire reaction scheme involving hydrogenation to a single product also strongly implies a six-membered ring is the common carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other be Y₂.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* cyclohexane. This means that Y₂ must also hydrogenate to give cyclohexane, implying it shares the C₆-ring skeleton.\n*   A C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Aromatic rings are unreactive with Br₂ water but are hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Find the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since Mixture X and Mixture Y are both equimolar, the overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check (Optional)**\n*   Let's verify that a valid Mixture X exists. Mixture X is composed of two C₆-ring compounds that decolorize bromine water and have no conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A perfect pair of candidates is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds (unlike the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Both hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer, fitting the description of the disproportionation.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms the result from Step 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction can be expressed as: `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use atomic masses of H=1 and C=12.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is a very close match. So, let's assume `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed from hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, despite being unsaturated, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions due to its aromatic stability.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y1 (cyclohexane) does not react. Y2 must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it could be another saturated C6 isomer or an aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer like methylcyclopentane, severe hydrogenation would cause ring-opening to form alkanes (like n-hexane or methylpentane), not just cyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only* Z is formed.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12`.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. Since the products are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 on both sides.\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can balance the atoms.\n    *   Carbon: C atoms in (X1 + X2) = C atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Hydrogen: H atoms in (X1 + X2) = H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 must have a six-carbon ring structure. So, their formulas are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   We know `x + y = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Non-conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds, which are not conjugated.\n    *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated bonds, so it is ruled out).\n*   Let's test if these two compounds fit our hydrogen count:\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n    `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n    In this reaction, the diene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2H. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   We can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For a saturated hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   Let's calculate the mass fraction of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of CnH2n ≈ 12n + 2n = 14n\n    *   Mass of hydrogen = 2n\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (14n) = 2/14 = 1/7\n*   Converting 1/7 to a percentage: (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let Y = (Cyclohexane + Compound D).\n    *   Cyclohexane does not react with hydrogen.\n    *   So, hydrogenation of Compound D must produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Compound D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n*   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would have a different carbon skeleton. While severe hydrogenation might cause rearrangement, a more direct interpretation is needed.\n*   Let's consider D being an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions but can be hydrogenated.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, severe)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a well-known reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane would yield only cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst:\n    A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for the reaction:\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    H(A) + H(B) = H(Benzene) + H(Cyclohexane)\n    H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18\n*   Now we need to find two unsaturated C6-ring compounds (A and B) that are not conjugated and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has 10 H atoms. It is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8): Has 8 H atoms, but its double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has 8 H atoms. Its double bonds are separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's see if A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene fit the criteria.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = H(C6H10) + H(C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n    *   The reaction would be:\n        C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible disproportionation (catalytic hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the chemical formula and structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass.\n*   Using Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, `1/7 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds. This means Z must be a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This implies that all the compounds in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   As we will see later, the reaction involves benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12). This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane: `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437`, which is close enough to 14.28% considering rounding. The `y=2x` derivation is more definitive.\n*   Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent, which matches the description.\n\n**2. Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. So, let C = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This means D must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   D must not decolorize bromine water. This rules out unsaturated compounds like cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes. This leaves saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Since D must be different from C (cyclohexane), the only plausible candidate is an aromatic compound: benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the components of mixture X.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   The overall transformation is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). The total number of C and H atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total atoms in products: C = 6+6=12, H = 12+6=18.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must together contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   Now let's use the properties of mixture X:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, confirming the C6 ring skeleton for both A and B.\n*   Let's identify possible structures for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond, not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 10).\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two double bonds, but they are conjugated. The problem statement explicitly excludes this.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 8).\n*   Let's test the pair A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction stoichiometry.\n*   All other conditions are met: equimolar mixture of two C6-ring liquids, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and the reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` represents a valid hydrogen transfer.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, which can be either an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's test the general formulas using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2).\n        If we set this to 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7), we get:\n        (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7\n        7 * (2n + 2) = 1 * (14n + 2)\n        14n + 14 = 14n + 2\n        14 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkane.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7.\n        1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. This is a match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. This fits the general formula CnH2n for n=6. We can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid in Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has the same six-carbon cyclic skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot have any C=C double bonds in a ring or side chain. The only remaining possibility for a C6 cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with aqueous bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B contain one or more C=C double bonds.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall reaction is:\n    A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Since the products have a C6 ring, and hydrogenation of X also yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6. The reactants A and B must collectively have C12H18 (12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms). Since A and B are both C6 compounds, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the components of mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H). This is a valid hydrogen transfer.\n*   The final condition is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated, non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12): `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula and H percentage:\n        *   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n with n=6.\n        *   %H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches perfectly.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (components A and B) and mixture Y (components C and D) under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means that hydrogenation of each of the four substances (A, B, C, D) must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   This implies that all four substances A, B, C, and D must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring. Any side chains or different ring structures would yield different products upon hydrogenation. For example, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane yields methylcyclopentane, not cyclohexane (though isomerization can occur under specific reforming conditions, the problem implies a common skeleton for all precursors).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say **C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   What is D? D must also have a C6 ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation must yield cyclohexane. It also must not decolorize bromine water. The most common chemical species that fits this description is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This mixture Y is formed by a \"disproportionation\" reaction when mixture X is heated with platinum. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A+B) -> Mixture Y (C+D)`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total composition of A+B must be C12H18.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. Both must have a C6-ring skeleton. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From `A+B = C12H18`, we have `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10).

It has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement `x+y=18`.\n    *   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --Pt, heat--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced by gaining 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is oxidized by losing 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   Thus, **Mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene) and one molecule of the second liquid (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Calculating `1/7` as a percentage gives `(1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%`. This is a perfect match for the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a liquid widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen (it's saturated). The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of Y must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component, Y₂, must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only common C₆ compound that is not an alkene but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) is converted into mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) through a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   We are also told that hydrogenating mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ are C₆ hydrocarbons with a ring structure, which become C₆H₁₂ upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   The reaction involves molecules that all have 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by applying the law of conservation of mass to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(For a complete picture, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). They both decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) * 100`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the fraction of hydrogen mass is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 100/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for CnH2n using integer masses:\n        `Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) * 100 = 2n / 14n * 100 = (1/7) * 100 = 14.2857...%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now and check if it fits all other conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let mixture Y = {Y1, Y2}. We can set Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenating Y, which is {Cyclohexane, Y2}, gives only Cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating Y2 must also yield Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that fit the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both X1 and X2 have a six-membered ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2 (equimolar)\n        Substituting our findings:\n        X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gaining hydrogen) and the other is dehydrogenated (losing hydrogen). To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H12) + H_atoms(C6H6)\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton, they must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes.\n        *   Cyclohexane: C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8\n    *   We need two different compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only possible combination is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene has only one double bond. For the cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --[Pt, heat]--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). Alkanes have the formula C_n H_{2n+2}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This means D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenating D must therefore also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z but be unsaturated. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a typical alkene or alkyne. This strongly indicates that D is an aromatic compound (an arene). Aromatic compounds only react with hydrogen under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) and do not react with bromine water.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n}, and D is the corresponding aromatic compound (arene) with the formula C_n H_{2n-6} (for a single benzene ring structure).\n    *   This structure requires n ≥ 6, as the smallest aromatic ring is benzene (C₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z. This means both A and B, when hydrogenated, form Z. Thus, A and B must also have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and D. They must be cycloalkenes or cyclodienes.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   Since A and B are cycloalkenes/dienes that form the cycloalkane Z, and D is an aromatic compound, the most logical composition for A and B is one cycloalkene and one cyclodiene.\n        *   Let A be the cycloalkene: C_n H_{2n-2}.\n        *   Let B be the cyclodiene: C_n H_{2n-4}.\n    *   The reaction becomes: C_n H_{2n-2} (A) + C_n H_{2n-4} (B) → C_n H_{2n} (Z) + C_n H_{2n-6} (D).\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: Left side = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. Right side = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n        *   The cycloalkene (A) is hydrogenated to the cycloalkane (Z), and the cyclodiene (B) is dehydrogenated to the aromatic compound (D). This is a plausible disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) that produces an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X.\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. This means the cyclodiene (B) must have isolated double bonds (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in A and B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The problem is constructed such that the answer should be one of the options. Let's test the options that correspond to integer values of n.\n        *   A) 18: If 4n-6 = 18, then 4n = 24, which gives n=6. This is a valid solution.\n        *   B) 12: If 4n-6 = 12, then 4n = 18, which gives n=4.5 (not an integer).\n        *   C) 22: If 4n-6 = 22, then 4n = 28, which gives n=7. This is also a valid solution.\n        *   D) 16: If 4n-6 = 16, then 4n = 22, which gives n=5.5 (not an integer).\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Scenario n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), D is benzene (C₆H₆). A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), and B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Scenario n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), D is toluene (C₇H₈). A is methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), and B is a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀). Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of further information, chemistry problems of this type usually refer to the most fundamental parent compounds. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the quintessential example of this type of chemistry, often used as the primary illustration in textbooks. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's find the ratio of moles of H to C. Assuming 100g of substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   Alternatively, using the approximation C=12 and H=1, a mass fraction of H of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CnHx, the mass fraction of H is `x / (12n + x)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7x = 12n + x`, which simplifies to `6x = 12n`, or `x = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). An acyclic saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane (CnH2n+2), and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids, let's call them C and D, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds. However, aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions, so they are a possibility.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) naturally gives Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. If D were a saturated isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane is to cyclohexane), this would be possible via isomerization under severe conditions. However, a more elegant solution exists if we consider aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are \"unsaturated\" in structure but \"saturated\" in the bromine water test. They readily hydrogenate to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that D is the aromatic derivative corresponding to the cycloalkane Z.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D would be benzene (C6H6).\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D would be toluene (C7H8).\n    *   This hypothesis is strong because hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Thus, hydrogenation of Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene} gives only methylcyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids, A and B, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton, and this skeleton is that of Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n\n4.  **Construct the Reaction**\n    *   Let's combine our findings. We have a reaction where A and B react to form C and D in a 1:1 ratio.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Let's test the C6 case: Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane (C), benzene (D)}. So C = C6H12 and D = C6H6.\n        *   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. To balance atoms, A and B must be C6 compounds, and the total atom count must match. The products have C12 and H18. So A+B must be C12H18.\n        *   Since A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring. Let's find two such compounds whose formulas sum to C12H18. The most plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `C6H10 + C6H8` gives C12H18. This matches.\n        *   The specific diene must be non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. So, B must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n        *   Let's propose the final set of compounds:\n            *   X = {cyclohexene (A, C6H10), cyclohexa-1,4-diene (B, C6H8)}\n            *   Y = {cyclohexane (C, C6H12), benzene (D, C6H6)}\n            *   Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem perfectly. The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known type of hydrogen transfer reaction, driven by the formation of the stable aromatic ring, and it qualifies as a disproportionation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*(Self-correction: A similar consistent scenario can be constructed for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane), leading to a total H count of 22. However, the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of transformation, making it the most likely intended answer in a chemistry problem of this nature.)*\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (y * mass_H) / (x * mass_C + y * mass_H).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n        y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n        7y = 12x + y\n        6y = 12x\n        y = 2x\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. Alkenes react with hydrogen (hydrogenation), but saturated cycloalkanes do not (under most conditions). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the mass percent for C6H12 with more precise atomic masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.01):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.01 = 12.12\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.01 = 72.06\n        Total Mass = 84.18\n        %H = (12.12 / 84.18) * 100% ≈ 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. The y=2x relationship is very strong.\n    *   The entire reaction scheme involves conversions that give a single product Z upon hydrogenation. This strongly implies all key compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the C6 skeleton of cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating it gives itself.\n    *   Now for substance D: It must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), meaning it has a C6 skeleton. It must not decolorize bromine water. The most common compound fitting this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of liquids A and B) is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it implies a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as a 1:1 reaction between the components of the equimolar mixture X to form the components of the equimolar mixture Y:\n        A + B → C + D\n        A + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   All compounds (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton. Let the formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation:\n        Number of H in (A + B) = Number of H in (C6H12 + C6H6)\n        a + b = 12 + 6\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is a + b, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does mixture X decolorize bromine water? This means A or B (or both) must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Are there no conjugated multiple bonds in X?\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for A and B. We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) with a total of 18 hydrogens. A good candidate pair would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   a = 10, b = 8. So a + b = 18. This fits.\n        *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This fits the condition. 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be ruled out because it is conjugated.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: C6H10 (acceptor) + C6H8 (donor) → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a known type of reaction.\n    *   The existence of this plausible pair confirms our reasoning is sound. The core calculation (a+b=18) is independent of finding the exact structures but is reinforced by it.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28% = 0.1428\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   Molar ratio C:H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) = 7.13 : 14.17 ≈ 1:2.\n*   The empirical formula is CH2.\n*   The molecular formula of a stable hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and a liquid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   We know one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation, which in this context (Pt catalyst, formation of a saturated compound) implies a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One substance is hydrogenated (reduced) to Z, and another must be dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   For the resulting mixture Y to not decolorize bromine water, the dehydrogenated product must be stable and unreactive to Br2 water. The most common examples are aromatic compounds.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, which is formed upon its full hydrogenation.\n\n**3. Identify the Carbon Skeleton and the Components**\n*   The hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y yields *only* substance Z. This is a crucial point that confirms all compounds in X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's consider the most common example of this type of reaction, which involves a six-membered ring.\n    *   If n=6, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, is a very common solvent, and is a liquid.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B must both yield Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are unsaturated compounds with a C6H12 carbon skeleton. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n*   The transformation from X to Y is a reaction where the components of X form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction can be written as:\n    A + B → C6H6 + C6H12\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms must balance. Both A and B have 6 carbons, so the carbon atoms are balanced (6+6 → 6+6). Let the formula of A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. The hydrogen atoms must also balance:\n    x + y = 6 + 12\n    x + y = 18\n*   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B is 18.\n*   Let's find plausible identities for A and B.\n    *   They are unsaturated cyclohexanes. A stable unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbon can be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   If A is C6H10 and B is C6H8, then the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits our deduction.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The problem states there are *no conjugated multiple bonds* in the compounds of mixture X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids and will decolorize bromine water.\n\n**5. Final Verification**\n*   **X** = {C6H10, C6H8} (equimolar, liquids, unsaturated, non-conjugated). Check.\n*   **Reaction** X → Y: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated. It produces an equimolar mixture. Check.\n*   **Y** = {C6H12, C6H6} (equimolar, do not decolorize Br2 water). Check.\n*   **Z** = C6H12 (constituent of Y, widely used solvent, CnH2n, %H=14.28%). Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 and C6H8 both hydrogenate to C6H12. Gives only Z. Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H6 and C6H12 both yield C6H12 under hydrogenation. Gives only Z. Check.\n\nThe logic is consistent. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n\nNumber of H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=1, 4/16=25%. For large n, H% approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ): H% = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n        *   Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂): H% will be lower.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Relate all compounds via the carbon skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (compounds A and B) and mixture Y (compounds C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D, as well as Z itself, share the same carbon skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over a heated platinum catalyst. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum (a reaction known as Zelinzky irreversible catalysis) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated to form a stable aromatic system.\n    *   Substance Z is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) and is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since C is the hydrogenated product, its partner D must be the dehydrogenated product. The final, most stable dehydrogenated product of a cycloalkane skeleton is the corresponding aromatic compound.\n    *   Mixture Y = {a cycloalkane (Z), an aromatic compound}.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   Z would be **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent with formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n        *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (Z) and benzene**.\n        *   Let's check: Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Both are liquids. Neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits the description of Y perfectly. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, so hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This also fits.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D` must be balanced. With Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)}, the total formula of the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the reactants A+B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B must have the same C₆ ring skeleton. We are looking for two different unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated ring compounds (non-conjugated):\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: one double bond.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: two isolated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check the sum of their hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches exactly.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n        In this hydrogen transfer, the diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the monoene gains those 2H to become cyclohexane. This reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.\n\n5.  **Verify all conditions**\n    *   X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}. Equimolar mixture of two liquids. Both have C=C bonds, so they decolorize Br₂ water. 1,4-CHD has no conjugated bonds. ✓\n    *   Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Equimolar mixture formed from X. Both are liquids that do not decolorize Br₂ water. ✓\n    *   Z = C₆H₁₂. Has H% of 14.3%, is a constituent of Y, is a widely used solvent, is saturated. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of X ({C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y ({C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   All conditions are satisfied by this C₆-based system. An analogous C₇-based system {methylcyclohexene, methylcyclohexadiene} is also possible and would lead to an answer of 22, but the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `14.28%` is equivalent to `0.1428`, which is very close to the fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` => `7m = 12n + m` => `6m = 12n` => `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The crucial clue is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means that all reactive components in both mixtures must share the same carbon skeleton, which upon saturation, yields Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which typically means it contains saturated compounds (alkanes or cycloalkanes) and is not aromatic, or at least does not contain simple alkenes/alkynes.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. If Y consists of `Y1` and `Y2`, and `Y1 = Z`, then hydrogenation of `Y2` must also yield Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is transformed into mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in organic chemistry is typically a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen or gains oxygen) and reduced (gains hydrogen or loses oxygen). For hydrocarbons, this usually means hydrogen transfer.\n    *   So, some component(s) in X are reduced, and some are oxidized to form the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of X be `X1 (CnH_a)` and `X2 (CnH_b)`.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be `Y1 (CnH_c)` and `Y2 (CnH_d)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction stoichiometry is likely `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. `C(2n)H(a+b) → C(2n)H(c+d)`. This means `a + b = c + d`.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Mixture Y and a Key Interpretation**\n    *   Initially, one might assume that because Y is \"saturated,\" both components must be cycloalkanes (e.g., Y1=cyclohexane, Y2=methylcyclopentane). This would mean `c=d=2n`. This leads to `a+b = 4n`.\n    *   However, mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components are unsaturated. Thus, `a < 2n` and `b < 2n`. This leads to a contradiction: `a+b` must be less than `4n`.\n    *   This contradiction suggests a flaw in the interpretation. The key lies in the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this strictly means saturated, in the context of many chemistry problems, it's used to distinguish reactive alkenes/alkynes from the less reactive aromatic compounds. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). Let's test the hypothesis that one of the products in Y is aromatic.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer producing a cycloalkane and an aromatic ring.\n    *   Let `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Let `Y2` be the corresponding aromatic compound, `Cn H(n)` (e.g., if n=6, benzene C6H6). This fits the `m=n` for typical aromatic rings like benzene, though more accurately `C6H6` hydrogenates to `C6H12`. Let's test with `n=6`, which is the most common for these reactions.\n    *   So let's hypothesize: `Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   And `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`.\n    *   Let's check if this Y fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n        *   \"Does not decolorize bromine water\": Plausible under this interpretation.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Yes, this works.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Yes, cyclohexane is present.\n\n5.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   If `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`, the total formula of the products (`Y1+Y2`) is `C12H18`.\n    *   Therefore, the total formula of the reactants (`X1+X2`) must also be `C12H18`.\n    *   So, for `X1 (C6Ha)` and `X2 (C6Hb)`, we must have `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Now we need to find two different liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the remaining conditions:\n        *   They must be C6 compounds.\n        *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).\n        *   They must not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's choose a pair of molecules with `a+b=18`. A good candidate pair is one with 10 hydrogens and one with 8 hydrogens.\n        *   **X1 = C6H10**: A C6 alkene. **Cyclohexene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, not conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n        *   **X2 = C6H8**: A C6 diene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, we can't use cyclohexa-1,3-diene. However, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, non-conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   So, a viable composition for mixture X is `{cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene}`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction**\n    *   The proposed transformation is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This reaction is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Our calculated value is 18, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z (CxHy).\n        The mass fraction of H is given by: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`.\n        Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get: `0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)`.\n        This fraction is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   This formula corresponds to either an alkene (C=C bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane** with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z itself, which is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n). Let's call this Y1. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by \"disproportionation\" using a platinum catalyst and heat. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z. This means the other component of Y (let's call it Y2) must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon hydrogenation, Y2 becomes Z.\n    *   Since Y2 has the same carbon skeleton (a C-n ring) and must be formed by dehydrogenation, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The formula for a simple aromatic compound derived from a CnH2n cycloalkane is **CnH2n-6**. For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) is related to benzene (C6H6). Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is related to toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). Aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of **CnH2n** (Z) and **CnH2n-6** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components have C=C double bonds. They are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that X1 and X2 also have the same CnH- carbon skeleton as Z. They are therefore cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The problem states \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\". This gives a specific structural constraint.\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a 1:1 molar reaction, as an *equimolar* mixture X forms an *equimolar* mixture Y. This implies the stoichiometry is `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n        `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to CnH2n, while the other is oxidized to CnH2n-6. For this to work, X1 must be more hydrogenated than Y2 (the aromatic) and X2 must be more hydrogenated than Y2. Also, X1 must be less hydrogenated than Y1 (the cycloalkane). The most logical combination for X1 and X2, which are non-conjugated and have a CnH- skeleton, is a cycloalkene (**CnH2n-2**) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (**CnH2n-4**).\n\n4.  **Balance the Reaction and Find the Solution**\n    *   Let's check if this combination works:\n        `X1 (CnH2n-4) + X2 (CnH2n-2) -> Y1 (CnH2n) + Y2 (CnH2n-6)` (The order of X1, X2 is arbitrary).\n        This does not balance.\n    *   Let's rethink the hydrogen transfer. The overall process must be balanced. Let the hydrogen counts in X1 and X2 be `a` and `b`. The reaction is:\n        `CnH_a + CnH_b -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n        The hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to `a + b`. So we need to find the value of `4n - 6`.\n    *   We have to determine 'n'. The problem mentions Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) fit this description and the CnH2n formula with H% ≈ 14.3%. The reaction scheme is plausible for both. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and simplest example is usually intended. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent system for this type of chemistry. Let's assume **n=6**.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C6H12\n        *   Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   X must be an equimolar mixture of C6 compounds that can react to form Y. Based on our model:\n            *   `X1` would be a cyclohexadiene, C6H8. To be non-conjugated, it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n            *   `X2` would be a cyclohexene, C6H10. The only one is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   The reaction is: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in C6H8 and C6H10.\n        *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the formula `4n - 6`:\n        For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Check the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 18.\n    *   The given options are A) 18, B) 22, C) 16, D) 12.\n    *   Our result matches option A.\n\n    (Note: If we had chosen n=7, the total H atoms would be 4(7) - 6 = 22, which is option B. However, the C6 system is the most classic and fundamental example for this type of problem.)\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1.\n    *   For a general hydrocarbon `CnHm`, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Let's test the given percentage: 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let's see which hydrocarbon formula class fits `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula `CnH2n` corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenating other substances and that Z itself \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, while a cycloalkane is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula `CnH2n`.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z itself is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also hydrogenate to Z (`CnH2n`). This means Y2 must have the same carbon skeleton (n carbon atoms in a ring).\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which matches the problem description.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic ring structure is benzene (C6H6). If Y2 is benzene, then n=6.\n    *   This implies that `Z = C6H12` (cyclohexane) and `Y2 = C6H6` (benzene).\n    *   This is a very plausible scenario: Z=cyclohexane is a widely used solvent, and its hydrogenation gives itself. Y2=benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. A disproportionation is a redox reaction where a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (Pt catalyst), it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2 -> 1 molecule of Y1 + 1 molecule of Y2`.\n    *   Substituting the components of Y we identified: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have the same C6-ring carbon skeleton as cyclohexane. So their formulas are `C6Hx` and `C6Hy`.\n    *   Based on the principle of conservation of mass for the disproportionation reaction, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in X1) + (Number of H in X2) = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)`.\n    *   Total H in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended)**\n    *   Let's check if we can find plausible structures for X1 and X2.\n    *   `X1 = C6Hx`, `X2 = C6Hy`, with `x+y=18`.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Let's try `X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10)` and `X2 = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)`.\n        *   Does x+y=18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Does cyclohexene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does it have conjugated bonds? No, the double bonds at positions 1 and 4 are isolated. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the diene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is chemically reasonable over a Pt catalyst.\n    *   This successful identification of X1 and X2 confirms our stoichiometric calculation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
