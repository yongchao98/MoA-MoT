This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. The enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the Michael acceptor and acts as the electrophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group at C1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-hydrogens**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-hydrogen, the strong base (t-BuOK) must abstract this proton to form the enolate. The negative charge will be delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed acts as a nucleophile, with the electron density concentrated on the C6 carbon.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group).\n    *   `Enolate (from C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → New C-C bond between C6 and the β-carbon (CH₂)`\n    *   The intermediate formed is then protonated (typically by the solvent, t-BuOH, or during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring remains intact. A new substituent is added to the C6 position.\n    *   The new substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The product structure is the 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one skeleton with a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group attached at C6.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate.\n    *   Let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The attachment point to the main chain is designated as C1' of the substituent ring. The principal functional group on the ring (the keto group) should get the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1' is the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering from C1' towards the keto group gives the keto group position C2'. The original C1 of the ketone is now C2' of the substituent.\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone is now C3' of the substituent. It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, formed from a nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**NO₂). Protons on this carbon are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. The resulting carbanion (nitronate ion) is the nucleophile: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon of the double bond that is further from the nitrile group).\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + CH₃-CH=CH-CN → New C-C bond between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.`\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond forms between the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group and the `CH(CH₃)` group of the original nitrile.\n    *   The product structure is:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH-CH₂-CN\n                       |\n                       CH₃\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The parent alkane is hexane, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We identify and number the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl** group is on C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group is on C4.\n    *   Combining these parts, the full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nThe calculated products for both reactions match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an alpha-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is the electrophile, specifically a Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation (enolate formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl carbon is C1.\n    *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C2 is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no alpha-protons**.\n    *   Carbon C6 is bonded to a methyl group and has **one alpha-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the strong base t-BuOK will exclusively deprotonate C6 to form the thermodynamic enolate.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The negatively charged C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A subsequent protonation step (e.g., from the t-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) neutralizes the intermediate to yield the final product, A.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Name the product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the three-carbon ester chain: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (the original C6 of the ketone) has a **methyl** group.\n        *   C2 (the original C1 of the ketone) has an **oxo** group.\n        *   C3 (the original C2 of the ketone) has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents on the ring gives: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane are acidic. The base, KOH, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the nucleophile.\n        *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   The (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water yields the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Name the product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon contains 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will act as the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the CH₂ group of CH₂=CHCOOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an ester enolate, which is then protonated during the workup step to give the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   To name the product, we can treat the propanoate as the parent chain, as done in the options.\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   We must now name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as position 1 of the substituent.\n        *   **Position 1 (old C6):** Point of attachment, has a **methyl** group.\n        *   **Position 2 (old C1):** Has the carbonyl group (**oxo**).\n        *   **Position 3 (old C2):** Has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   This reaction is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group).\n    *   This forms a nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (CH₃-**CH**=CHCN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the original nitropropane and the β-carbon of the original butenenitrile.\n    *   The intermediate carbanion (at the α-position to the nitrile) is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long.

This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one **α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate. The negative charge is delocalized between C6 and the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The resulting product structure has the -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product A:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`, which means a cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain. This matches our connectivity: `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules for such complex substituents, the ring is numbered starting from the point of attachment.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexanone ring for naming the substituent:\n        *   **New C1:** This is the old C6, the point of attachment.

It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### Reaction B Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).

This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon (the CH group bonded to the methyl group) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the original butene chain.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Naming the Product B:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (by H₂O) to give the final product.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `(CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)CH₂(α)CN)`.\n    *   The linear structure is: **CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C-6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C-6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the new group at C-6.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo (=O) group at C-1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C-2.\n        *   A methyl group and a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part is treated as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1' (attachment point):** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2' (original C-1):** Has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   **C-3' (original C-2):** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile then attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group), which is C-1.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile (C-3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the 1-nitropropane and C-3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment, after attack and protonation by water, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH-CH₂-CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this is the basis of the name.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C-1).\n    *   The chain is: CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C-3 and a **nitro** group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   **D) A = correct, B = correct**\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will be the nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). A strong, bulky base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6 relative to the carbonyl group (C1).\n    *   Let's analyze the substitution at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** is substituted with one ethyl group and one methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is substituted with one methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there are α-protons only at the C6 position, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate is the nucleophilic center. It will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the product. The product is an ethyl ester, specifically an ethyl propanoate derivative. The main chain is the propanoate.\n        *   Chain: ethyl O-C(=O)¹-CH₂²-CH₂³-\n    *   A substituted cyclohexyl group is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain. We need to name this cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   **C1'**: The attachment point (the original C6 of the ketone). It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (the original C1). It is an \"oxo\" group.\n        *   **C3'**: The next carbon (the original C2). It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting the substituent name together: (3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. An α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition**. The base deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ ↔ CH₃-CH₂-CH=N⁺(O⁻)O⁻. The nucleophilic attack occurs through the carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-2-enenitrile (C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N). The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting carbanion at C2 is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure from the two parts:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂)\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)\n        *   Connecting them: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   C¹N - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) on C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   First, let's draw the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The IUPAC name indicates the following structure:\n        *   A cyclohexanone ring (C=O at C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are on C2.\n        *   A methyl group is on C6.\n        ```\n              O\n             //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n       C6(Me)-C5--C4--C3\n        \\______/\n        (CH₂ groups at C3, C4, C5)\n        ```\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since deprotonation can only occur where there are α-protons, the base (t-BuOK) must abstract the single proton from C6. There is no other possibility for enolate formation. The \"steric hindrance\" consideration mentioned in the prompt is moot here, as there's no choice of proton to remove.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate forms with the negative charge effectively on C6. This nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The group added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The intermediate is protonated (by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to yield the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain. So the name will be **ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' corresponds to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's locate the other groups relative to C1':\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The keto group (=O) was at C1, which is adjacent to C6. So, the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, they are on C3'.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 1'-methyl, 2'-oxo, 3'-ethyl, 3'-methyl. In alphabetical order (excluding numerical prefixes), this gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches the one provided in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion, which attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) to form the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** In but-2-enenitrile (N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃), the electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond electrophilic. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is C3.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give product B.\n    *   The product structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's check the carbon count.

This is incorrect.\n        *   `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`: 6 (hexane) + 1 (methyl) = 7 carbons. This is correct.\n    *   This analysis alone eliminates options A and C.\n    *   To confirm, let's name our derived structure: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (`NC¹-C²-C³(CH₃)-C⁴(NO₂)-C⁵-C⁶`). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n**B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   This nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). Ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, a new enolate is formed on the acrylate moiety, which is then protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product A**\n    *   The starting ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one) is modified by the addition of a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group at the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the naming convention in the options, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring. We need to number the ring for naming, starting from the point of attachment. Let's call the attachment carbon C1'.\n        *   The original C6 of the ketone is now C1'. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon, C=O) is now C2'. So, it is a 2'-oxo group.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   So the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This structure for product A matches the one given in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is subsequently protonated by water.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting the C1 of the 1-nitropropyl group to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

This eliminates option D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction, a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can *only* occur at C6. The base removes the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or tert-butanol, which is formed in the first step) to yield the final product.\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name the final product, we must identify the principal functional group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the 3-carbon ester chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is treated as a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as locant 1. This is the carbon that was C6 in the starting ketone.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (oxo group, ethyl group, methyl groups).\n    *   Following the connectivity from the starting material:\n        *   New C1 (the attachment point, formerly C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering from C1 towards the oxo group at C2 gives the locant set {1, 2, 3, 3} for the methyl, oxo, ethyl, and methyl groups respectively.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Comparing this with the options, this matches the name for A in options C and D. The name for A in options A and B (`...3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl...`) is structurally inconsistent with the outcome of this reaction.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n2.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   `CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN + H₂O → CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN + OH⁻`\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's identify the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified. The chain runs from the nitrile carbon through the main backbone to the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.\n    *   `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and a nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the product is 7 (3 from 1-nitropropane and 4 from but-2-enenitrile). Our named product, `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (6 in chain + 1 in methyl group), has 7 carbons.\n    *   The alternative name for B in the options is `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. A butanenitrile with two methyl groups would have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 carbons, which is inconsistent with the reactants. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to determine the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To act as a nucleophile, it must first be deprotonated by a base to form an enolate. The possible positions for deprotonation are the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will readily deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at C6.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate Formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the ketone, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate. The nucleophilic character resides on C6.\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate from the acrylate moiety.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate to yield the final product, A.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   This name treats the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's check if the substituent name, `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`, matches our product. The `-yl` indicates the point of attachment is C1 of the ring.\n            *   Attachment point (our old C6) is numbered as C1. It has a methyl group. This matches \"**1-methyl**\".\n            *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (our old C1) is numbered as C2. This matches \"**2-oxo**\".\n            *   The next carbon (our old C2), which has an ethyl and a methyl group, is numbered C3. This matches \"**3-ethyl**\" and \"**3-methyl**\".\n        *   The name is a valid, though complex, IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The name provided in options B and D, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, suggests a 1,4-relationship between the attachment point and the oxo group, which is inconsistent with a Michael addition starting from an enolate formed adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH group attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n        *   Combining them gives the skeleton: `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n        *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n        *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B given in options A and D. The name in options B and C, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different molecular structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will form an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Identify the site of enolate formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to find the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there is only one possible proton to remove, the base `t-BuOK` will deprotonate C6 to form a single regiochemical enolate.\n\n3.  **Determine the product structure:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This results in a new C-C bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal `CH2` of the acrylate moiety. After workup (protonation), the product will have an `-CH2CH2COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is as follows:\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring with C=O at position 1.\n    *   An ethyl and a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   A methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) at position 6.\n\n4.  **Name the product (Product A):** The options provide names in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated C1. Numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the `oxo` group) the lowest possible number.\n    *   The attachment point (C1) is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 makes the original ketone carbonyl (C1 of the ketone) the C2 of the substituent name (i.e., `2-oxo`).\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The `oxo` group is at C2.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent name.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10), so the base KOH will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent).\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is `(NC-CH2-CH(CH3)) - (CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3)`.\n    *   Let's write this as a single chain: `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** We apply IUPAC rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   This combination of reactants points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group.

It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only the C6 carbon has a proton, the base can only deprotonate at this position. This forms a single regiochemical enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (specifically, the C6 carbon) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (A):**\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated (likely by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base, or during workup) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   The original ketone: C1 is the carbonyl, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The added group at C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C1 is the carbonyl, C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, and C6 has a methyl group AND a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n    *   Now, let's match this structure with the IUPAC names provided in the options. The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This requires re-numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent.\n        *   Parent name: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`\n        *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached to the propanoate chain at the carbon that was C6 in the original ketone. In the substituent naming convention, this attachment point is designated C1 of the ring.\n        *   Let's re-number the ring based on this new C1:\n            *   **New C1:** Point of attachment (was original C6). It also has a methyl group.\n            *   **New C2:** The carbonyl carbon (was original C1). Thus, we have a \"2-oxo\" substituent.\n            *   **New C3:** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group (was original C2).\n        *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B. Options C and D, which suggest a different connectivity (\"4-oxo\"), are incorrect.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH, H₂O → B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael Addition**. We have a nitroalkane (Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts a proton from the carbon α to the nitro group. These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group and resonance stabilization of the resulting anion (the nitronate).\n    *   For 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂), the α-carbon has two acidic protons. Deprotonation forms the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   Nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks `CH₃-`**`CH`**`=CH-CN` at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` from 1-nitropropane is now bonded to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long: N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃.\n        *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and C. The name in options B and D (\"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\") is incorrect; it has the wrong carbon count (6 carbons instead of 7) and structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results points to option A as the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is an enolate generated from the ketone.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** (electrophile) is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The **base** is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). The α-carbons are at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1, and C-3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C-6 position has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the C-6 position. This regioselectivity means only one enolate is formed, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 of the ketone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to regenerate the carbonyl group and neutralize the molecule, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone ring is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's use the standard numbering where C=O is C-1.\n    *   The substituents are: C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C-6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The new group added to C-6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate).\n    *   To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the ester can be treated as the parent chain: `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The chain is `Substituent-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. It's an ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate.\n    *   Now let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The ring is attached to the propanoate chain at what was originally C-6 of the ketone. For naming purposes, this attachment point on the ring is designated as C-1'.\n        *   C-1' (the attachment point) has a methyl group.\n        *   C-2' is the carbon with the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        *   C-3' has the ethyl and methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(1,3-dimethyl-3-ethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**, which can be alphabetized to **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is a carbanion (specifically a nitronate ion) formed from 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The **base** is potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂) acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-protons to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: CH₃CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the carbon backbones:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (NO₂)-CH-(CH₂CH₃)\n        *   From (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃-CH-(CH₂CN)\n    *   Combining these at the newly formed bond gives the structure: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C-1:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C-3 and a nitro group at C-4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for product B in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these with the given options, the only option that matches both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, will be deprotonated by the strong base t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) to form an enolate. This enolate is the **Michael donor** (nucleophile).\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester and will act as the **Michael acceptor** (electrophile).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n        *   C1 is the carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   The bulky, non-nucleophilic base t-BuOK will abstract the only available acidic α-proton, which is at the C6 position. This regioselectively forms the enolate where the negative charge (or the C=C double bond in the enolate form) is associated with C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety.\n    *   After workup (protonation, likely by t-butanol formed in the first step), the product is formed. The ethyl acrylate fragment becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl and methyl groups\n        *   C6: a methyl group AND the new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   To name this product in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, we treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is numbered as position 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   This C1' has a methyl group.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The path going towards the original C1 (the ketone) is C1' → C2'(=O) → C3'(Et, Me). This gives locants {1-Me, 2-oxo, 3-Et, 3-Me}. The alternative numbering gives a higher set of locants.\n    *   Combining these pieces alphabetically, the cyclohexyl substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A description in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis reaction is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH will deprotonate it to form a carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the **Michael donor**. The specific carbanion is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile and serves as the **Michael acceptor**.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion at the α-carbon (C2) of the nitrile is then protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product from the fragments:\n        *   Nitrile fragment: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`\n        *   Nitroalkane fragment: `-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a Michael Addition. The ketone will be deprotonated by the strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O at C1): C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (it is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (it is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5) and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base must abstract the single available proton from C6. This forms a specific enolate with the negative charge localized at C6.\n\n3.  **Perform Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the terminal CH₂ of the acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n\n4.  **Name Product A:** The product is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate, as per the options. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Parent Chain: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Substituent Name: We must name the cyclohexyl ring. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain (the original C6) is numbered as C1' for naming purposes. This C1' has a methyl group. Numbering towards the carbonyl group makes the original C1 of the ketone into C2'. So, the name has a \"2'-oxo\" component. The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) becomes C3'.\n    *   Putting the substituent parts together and alphabetizing gives **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Thus, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

The principal functional group on the ring (the keto group) should get the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1' is the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering from C1' towards the keto group gives the keto group position C2'. The original C1 of the ketone is now C2' of the substituent.\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone is now C3' of the substituent.

This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane are acidic. The base, KOH, will deprotonate this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the nucleophile.\n        *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   The (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is the Michael acceptor.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water yields the final product, B.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Name the product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon contains 6 carbons.

The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone.

It has **no α-hydrogens**.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one **α-hydrogen**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position to form the enolate.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C-6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C-6 attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the ethyl acrylate moiety becomes a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached to C-6.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the cyclohexanone core with its original substituents, plus the new group at C-6.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with:\n        *   An oxo (=O) group at C-1.\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C-2.\n        *   A methyl group and a -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group at C-6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This means the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` part is treated as the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C-6).\n        *   **C-1' (attachment point):** Has a methyl group.\n        *   **C-2' (original C-1):** Has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   **C-3' (original C-2):** Has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The α-protons of a nitroalkane are acidic and can be removed by a base like KOH to form a nitronate anion, which is a potent carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile then attacks the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group), which is C-1.\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile (C-3 of the butene chain).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C-1 of the 1-nitropropane and C-3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The nitropropane fragment is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The butenenitrile fragment, after attack and protonation by water, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH-CH₂-CN\n                        |\n                        CH₃\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this is the basis of the name.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C-1).\n    *   The chain is: CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C-3 and a **nitro** group at C-4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   **D) A = correct, B = correct**\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will be the nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). A strong, bulky base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6 relative to the carbonyl group (C1).\n    *   Let's analyze the substitution at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** is substituted with one ethyl group and one methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is substituted with one methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there are α-protons only at the C6 position, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate is the nucleophilic center. It will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the product. The product is an ethyl ester, specifically an ethyl propanoate derivative. The main chain is the propanoate.\n        *   Chain: ethyl O-C(=O)¹-CH₂²-CH₂³-\n    *   A substituted cyclohexyl group is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain. We need to name this cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   **C1'**: The attachment point (the original C6 of the ketone). It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (the original C1). It is an \"oxo\" group.\n        *   **C3'**: The next carbon (the original C2). It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting the substituent name together: (3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. An α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition**. The base deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ ↔ CH₃-CH₂-CH=N⁺(O⁻)O⁻. The nucleophilic attack occurs through the carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-2-enenitrile (C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N). The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting carbanion at C2 is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure from the two parts:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂)\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)\n        *   Connecting them: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   C¹N - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) on C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition. The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate, which will then attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   First, let's draw the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The IUPAC name indicates the following structure:\n        *   A cyclohexanone ring (C=O at C1).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are on C2.\n        *   A methyl group is on C6.\n        ```\n              O\n             //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n       C6(Me)-C5--C4--C3\n        \\______/\n        (CH₂ groups at C3, C4, C5)\n        ```\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and a hydrogen). It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since deprotonation can only occur where there are α-protons, the base (t-BuOK) must abstract the single proton from C6. There is no other possibility for enolate formation. The \"steric hindrance\" consideration mentioned in the prompt is moot here, as there's no choice of proton to remove.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate forms with the negative charge effectively on C6. This nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The group added to C6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`.\n    *   The intermediate is protonated (by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to yield the final product, A.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule has the `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain. So the name will be **ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1' of the substituent ring. This C1' corresponds to C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's locate the other groups relative to C1':\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1'.\n        *   The keto group (=O) was at C1, which is adjacent to C6. So, the keto group is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, they are on C3'.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 1'-methyl, 2'-oxo, 3'-ethyl, 3'-methyl. In alphabetical order (excluding numerical prefixes), this gives `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This name matches the one provided in options B and C.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic α-protons.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition. The base deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group, creating a nucleophilic nitronate anion, which attacks the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) to form the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Electrophile:** In but-2-enenitrile (N≡C¹-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₃), the electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond electrophilic. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, which is C3.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion of the nitronate attacks C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give product B.\n    *   The product structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's check the carbon count.

This is incorrect.\n        *   `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`: 6 (hexane) + 1 (methyl) = 7 carbons. This is correct.\n    *   This analysis alone eliminates options A and C.\n    *   To confirm, let's name our derived structure: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile, so its carbon is C1. The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (`NC¹-C²-C³(CH₃)-C⁴(NO₂)-C⁵-C⁶`). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name in options B and D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n**B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   This nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).

It has a methyl group.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon, C=O) is now C2'. So, it is a 2'-oxo group.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   So the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This structure for product A matches the one given in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`.

The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is subsequently protonated by water.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting the C1 of the 1-nitropropyl group to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).

The base removes the proton from C6, forming the corresponding enolate.\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the carbon further from the ester group). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate anion is protonated (likely by abstracting a proton from the solvent or tert-butanol, which is formed in the first step) to yield the final product.\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂CH₂COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name the final product, we must identify the principal functional group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The ester group has higher priority than the ketone group.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted ethyl propanoate. The main chain is the 3-carbon ester chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring system is treated as a substituent on carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as locant 1. This is the carbon that was C6 in the starting ketone.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents (oxo group, ethyl group, methyl groups).\n    *   Following the connectivity from the starting material:\n        *   New C1 (the attachment point, formerly C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   New C2 (formerly C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (formerly C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Numbering from C1 towards the oxo group at C2 gives the locant set {1, 2, 3, 3} for the methyl, oxo, ethyl, and methyl groups respectively.\n    *   The name of the substituent is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Comparing this with the options, this matches the name for A in options C and D.

The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n4.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (the carbon bonded to the methyl group). A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ + CH₃CH=CHCN  →  CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN`\n5.  **Protonation:** The intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   `CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH⁻CN + H₂O → CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN + OH⁻`\n6.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   Let's identify the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is identified. The chain runs from the nitrile carbon through the main backbone to the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.\n    *   `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and a nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetically, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the product is 7 (3 from 1-nitropropane and 4 from but-2-enenitrile). Our named product, `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` (6 in chain + 1 in methyl group), has 7 carbons.\n    *   The alternative name for B in the options is `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`. A butanenitrile with two methyl groups would have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 carbons, which is inconsistent with the reactants. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to determine the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. To act as a nucleophile, it must first be deprotonated by a base to form an enolate. The possible positions for deprotonation are the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon. It has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will readily deprotonate the only available α-hydrogen at C6.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the CH₂ group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate Formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the ketone, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate. The nucleophilic character resides on C6.\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate from the acrylate moiety.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated (e.g., by tert-butanol formed in the first step or during aqueous workup) at the α-carbon of the original acrylate to yield the final product, A.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   Let's analyze the name provided in the options: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   This name treats the product as an ethyl propanoate derivative. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's check if the substituent name, `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`, matches our product. The `-yl` indicates the point of attachment is C1 of the ring.\n            *   Attachment point (our old C6) is numbered as C1. It has a methyl group. This matches \"**1-methyl**\".\n            *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (our old C1) is numbered as C2. This matches \"**2-oxo**\".\n            *   The next carbon (our old C2), which has an ethyl and a methyl group, is numbered C3. This matches \"**3-ethyl**\" and \"**3-methyl**\".\n        *   The name is a valid, though complex, IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The name provided in options B and D, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, suggests a 1,4-relationship between the attachment point and the oxo group, which is inconsistent with a Michael addition starting from an enolate formed adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group (NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-hydrogens (on the carbon attached to NO₂) acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (the CH group attached to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion Formation):** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from 1-nitropropane, creating a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `(NO₂)-CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `(CN)-CH₂-CH-(CH₃)`\n        *   Combining them gives the skeleton: `(NO₂)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name ends in \"-nitrile\".\n        *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-C(1)N`\n        *   The substituents are a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n        *   The final name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B given in options A and D. The name in options B and C, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different molecular structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of Reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of Reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that only option A correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will form an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Identify the site of enolate formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to find the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there is only one possible proton to remove, the base `t-BuOK` will deprotonate C6 to form a single regiochemical enolate.\n\n3.  **Determine the product structure:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This results in a new C-C bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal `CH2` of the acrylate moiety. After workup (protonation), the product will have an `-CH2CH2COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is as follows:\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring with C=O at position 1.\n    *   An ethyl and a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   A methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) at position 6.\n\n4.  **Name the product (Product A):** The options provide names in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated C1. Numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the `oxo` group) the lowest possible number.\n    *   The attachment point (C1) is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 makes the original ketone carbonyl (C1 of the ketone) the C2 of the substituent name (i.e., `2-oxo`).\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The `oxo` group is at C2.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent name.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10), so the base KOH will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent).\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is `(NC-CH2-CH(CH3)) - (CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3)`.\n    *   Let's write this as a single chain: `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** We apply IUPAC rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   This combination of reactants points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group.

These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group and resonance stabilization of the resulting anion (the nitronate).\n    *   For 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂), the α-carbon has two acidic protons. Deprotonation forms the nucleophile: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   Nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks `CH₃-`**`CH`**`=CH-CN` at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product B.\n    *   Let's assemble the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)` from 1-nitropropane is now bonded to `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` from but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN**\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n        *   The chain is 6 carbons long: N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃.\n        *   The parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n        *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and C. The name in options B and D (\"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\") is incorrect; it has the wrong carbon count (6 carbons instead of 7) and structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results points to option A as the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is an enolate generated from the ketone.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** (electrophile) is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The **base** is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, a proton must be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon). The α-carbons are at positions C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1, and C-3) and has no α-protons.\n    *   The C-6 position has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only deprotonate the C-6 position. This regioselectivity means only one enolate is formed, with the double bond between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C-6 of the ketone enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during aqueous workup (implied) to regenerate the carbonyl group and neutralize the molecule, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone ring is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's use the standard numbering where C=O is C-1.\n    *   The substituents are: C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C-6 has a methyl group.\n    *   The new group added to C-6 is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate).\n    *   To name the final product according to IUPAC rules, the ester can be treated as the parent chain: `ethyl propanoate`. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The chain is `Substituent-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. It's an ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate.\n    *   Now let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. The ring is attached to the propanoate chain at what was originally C-6 of the ketone. For naming purposes, this attachment point on the ring is designated as C-1'.\n        *   C-1' (the attachment point) has a methyl group.\n        *   C-2' is the carbon with the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        *   C-3' has the ethyl and methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(1,3-dimethyl-3-ethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**, which can be alphabetized to **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Combining everything, the full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for product A in options C and D.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   The **nucleophile** is a carbanion (specifically a nitronate ion) formed from 1-nitropropane.\n    *   The **Michael acceptor** is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The **base** is potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂) acidic.\n    *   KOH removes one of these α-protons to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which acts as the carbon nucleophile.\n    *   Nucleophile: CH₃CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the carbon backbones:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (NO₂)-CH-(CH₂CH₃)\n        *   From (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH₃-CH-(CH₂CN)\n    *   Combining these at the newly formed bond gives the structure: CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C-1:\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C-3 and a nitro group at C-4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for product B in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these with the given options, the only option that matches both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, will be deprotonated by the strong base t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) to form an enolate. This enolate is the **Michael donor** (nucleophile).\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester and will act as the **Michael acceptor** (electrophile).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n        *   C1 is the carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   The alpha-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   The bulky, non-nucleophilic base t-BuOK will abstract the only available acidic α-proton, which is at the C6 position. This regioselectively forms the enolate where the negative charge (or the C=C double bond in the enolate form) is associated with C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety.\n    *   After workup (protonation, likely by t-butanol formed in the first step), the product is formed. The ethyl acrylate fragment becomes a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following substituents on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: =O (oxo group)\n        *   C2: ethyl and methyl groups\n        *   C6: a methyl group AND the new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   To name this product in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, we treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the substituent ring is numbered as position 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone is now C1' of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   This C1' has a methyl group.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The path going towards the original C1 (the ketone) is C1' → C2'(=O) → C3'(Et, Me). This gives locants {1-Me, 2-oxo, 3-Et, 3-Me}. The alternative numbering gives a higher set of locants.\n    *   Combining these pieces alphabetically, the cyclohexyl substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the product A description in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis reaction is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH will deprotonate it to form a carbanion (a nitronate ion), which is the **Michael donor**. The specific carbanion is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile and serves as the **Michael acceptor**.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion at the α-carbon (C2) of the nitrile is then protonated by water (H₂O) in the workup.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product from the fragments:\n        *   Nitrile fragment: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`\n        *   Nitroalkane fragment: `-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n        *   Connecting these at the point of attack gives: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons:\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   We have two substituents on this hexanenitrile chain:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   We can verify the molecular formula. Reactants: C₃H₇NO₂ + C₄H₅N = C₇H₁₂N₂O₂. Product (3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile): C₇H₁₂N₂O₂. The formula matches. The alternative name for product B given in options A/B, 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (C₆H₁₀N₂O₂), has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   The name for product B matches the description in options C and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. (Matches B and D)\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. (Matches C and D)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
