This factor is the ratio of the population ratios under the two temperature conditions.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Equation:**\nThe problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of populations of two energy levels (N₂/N₁) is governed by the Boltzmann Equation:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere `T` is the effective temperature.\n\n**2. Define the Two States and the Factor:**\nWe are comparing the star in two states:\n*   **State 1 (Unspotted):** The effective temperature is T₁ = 6000 K. The population ratio is `Ratio₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`.\n*   **State 2 (Spotted):** The overall effective temperature is T₂ = 5500 K. The population ratio is `Ratio₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star *does not have spots* compared to *when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the factor `F = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`.\n\n`F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n\nThe term with the statistical weights, (g₂/g₁), cancels out:\n\n`F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\nUsing the exponent rule `eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`:\n\n`F = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):**\nThe energy of the transition `ΔE` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ΔE = hc/λ`. Therefore, the term we need is `ΔE/k = hc/(λk)`.\nThe given values are:\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   `T₁` = 6000 K\n*   `T₂` = 5500 K\n\nThe physical constants are:\n*   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n**4. Computation:**\nThe calculation was performed using the provided Python script in the previous step. The script accurately computes `ΔE/k` and then uses it in the final expression for `F`.\n\n*   `delta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (wavelength_m * k)`\n*   `exponent = (-delta_E_over_k) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )`\n*   `F = exp(exponent)`\n\nThe code output was `4.506409276298926`.\n\n**5.

The extra information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage was used to establish the context for the drop in effective temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K, but these values are not directly needed for the final calculation as the two effective temperatures are given.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn astronomer is investigating the properties of a star by analyzing the population of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in different energy states. The ratio of atoms in two specific energy levels changes with the star's effective temperature. We are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star's surface is clear of spots compared to when it is 40% covered by spots.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative population of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) and lower energy level (level 1), respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Define the scenarios:** We have two scenarios with different effective temperatures:\n    *   **No spots:** T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   **With spots:** T_spots = 5500 K\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio for each scenario:**\n    *   Let R_nospots be the population ratio when there are no spots:\n        R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n\n    *   Let R_spots be the population ratio when there are spots:\n        R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n4.  **Calculate the factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the two ratios: `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)), we get:\n\n    Factor = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) )\n    Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula ΔE = h * c / λ, where `h` is the Planck constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) and `c` is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n\n    Substituting this into the factor equation:\n\n    Factor = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:** Now, we plug in all the known values:\n    *   h = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n\n    Let's calculate the terms:\n    *   ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 2.998e8) / (1448e-10) ≈ 1.371 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   ΔE / k ≈ (1.371 × 10⁻¹⁸) / (1.381 × 10⁻²³) ≈ 99363 K\n    *   (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ≈ 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n    *   Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ≈ 99363 * 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.505\n    *   Factor = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50\n\nThe calculation based on the provided code output gives a result of **4.506**.

Finding the Required Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of `R_nospots` to `R_spots`.\n\nFactor = `R_nospots` / `R_spots`\n\nFactor = `[(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]]`\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, `(g₂ / g₁)`, cancels out:\n\nFactor = `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\nUsing the exponent property `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n\nFactor = `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]`\nFactor = `exp[ΔE/k * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon from the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy of a photon is given by `E = h * c / λ`.\n\nWe will use the following constants:\n-   Planck's constant, `h` = 4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n-   Speed of light, `c` = 2.998 × 10¹⁰ Å/s (in Angstroms per second for convenience)\n-   Boltzmann constant, `k` = 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n\nΔE = `(h * c) / λ` = (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 2.998 × 10¹⁸ Å/s) / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\nAlternatively, the code calculated a more precise value `delta_E_ev` = 8.5635 eV.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the factor equation.\n\nFactor = `exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\nFactor = `exp[ (8.5635 eV / (8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K)) * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]`\nFactor = `exp[ 99379 K * (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) K⁻¹ ]`\nFactor = `exp[ 99379 * (0.00001515) ]`\nFactor = `exp(1.5058)`\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe provided code execution gave a result of `factor=4.5064092748976705`, which is a more precise calculation.

The physical reasoning and application of the Boltzmann equation are sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`N₂/N₁`) changes as the star's temperature changes. The population of energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (2) to a lower energy level (1) is given by:\n\n`R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n-   `N₂`, `N₁`: Number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n-   `g₂`, `g₁`: Statistical weights of the levels (these are constants for the specific transition and atom).\n-   `ΔE`: The energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n-   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (`1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K`).\n-   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratios\n\nWe have two scenarios with different temperatures:\n1.  **No Spots:** Temperature `T_nospots = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R_nospots`.\n    `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n\n2.  **With Spots:** Temperature `T_spots = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R_spots`.\n    `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\n### 3. Finding the Required Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the ratio `R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\n`Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`\n\n`Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe `(g₂ / g₁)` term cancels out:\n\n`Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\nUsing the exponential property `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots) ]`\n\nThis can be rearranged to make the calculation cleaner:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of a photon associated with a transition is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\n-   `h` (Planck's constant) = `6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n-   `c` (speed of light) = `3.00 × 10⁸ m/s`\n-   `λ` (wavelength) = 1448 Å = `1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n\n`ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ * 3.00 × 10⁸) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the factor equation. The term `ΔE / k` is:\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99446 K`\n\nNow substitute this into the full expression for the factor:\n\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (1 / 5500 - 1 / 6000) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (0.00018181... - 0.00016666...) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (0.00001515...) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 1.506... ]`\n`Factor ≈ 4.509`\n\nThe code output provided a value of `4.506...`, which is very close. This small difference arises from using more precise values for the physical constants, but the conclusion is the same.\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately **4.5**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem is solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio (R) of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n₂) to a lower energy level (n₁) is given by:\n    R = n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where g₁, g₂ are the statistical weights (constants for a given transition), ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define Ratios for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let T₁ be the temperature without spots: T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   Let T₂ be the effective temperature with spots: T₂ = 5500 K.\n\n    The ratio without spots is:\n    R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n    The ratio with spots is:\n    R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:**\n    The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of R₁ to R₂:\n    Factor = R₁ / R₂\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k*T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):**\n    The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength λ = 1448 Å.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n    So, the term in the exponent is:\n    ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Compute:**\n    We need to calculate:\n    Factor = exp[ ( (h*c) / (λ*k) ) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n\n    The code provided in the thinking process performs this calculation accurately:\n    `exponent = ((h*c) / (λ*k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)`\n    `Factor = exp(exponent)`\n\n    The execution result shows the factor is approximately `4.506`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated factor is ~4.5. This corresponds to option C. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of surface covered by spots is extra data not required for this specific calculation, which directly compares the effect of the two given effective temperatures.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The question asks for the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two different energy levels. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of these levels is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2, respectively.\n    *   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Define the two scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No Spots):** The effective temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.

The population ratio is `Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the required factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *from* the \"no spots\" case *to* the \"with spots\" case. The problem states that the ratio *decreases* when there are spots, so `Ratio₂ < Ratio₁`. We are looking for the factor `Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`.\n\n    Factor = `Ratio₁ / Ratio₂` = [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is constant and cancels out.\n\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    Using the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), we get:\n\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T₁) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n    Factor = exp[ ΔE/k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** We are given the wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is 1448 Å (or 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m). The energy difference can be calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light. We can directly calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n\n    ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n5.  **Perform the final calculation:** Now, we plug in the values into the formula derived in step 3. The python code generated in the thinking process performed exactly this calculation:\n\n    *   Constants:\n        *   h (Planck constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   Temperatures:\n        *   T₁ = 6000 K\n        *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   Wavelength:\n        *   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    The calculation `exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]` gives a result of approximately 4.5.

I will re-verify the calculation to ensure the final result is correct and robust.\n\n**Recalculation and Verification**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the Boltzmann equation and calculating the ratio of population ratios at two different temperatures.\n\nThe formula derived in the initial reasoning is:\n`Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted = exp[ ( (E₂ - E₁) / k ) * ( 1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted ) ]`\n\nWhere `(E₂ - E₁) = hc/λ`.\n\nLet's re-calculate the components more carefully:\n\n1.  **Energy Term `(hc/λk)`:**\n    *   h = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   k = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `hc/k` (Second radiation constant) ≈ 0.0143877687 m·K\n    *   `hc/(λk) = 0.0143877687 / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 99363.04 K`\n\n2.  **Temperature Term `(1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)`:**\n    *   T_spotted = 5500 K\n    *   T_unspotted = 6000 K\n    *   `1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000` K⁻¹\n    *   `1 / 66000 ≈ 1.51515 × 10⁻⁵` K⁻¹\n\n3.  **Exponent `Exponent = (hc/(λk)) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)`:**\n    *   `Exponent ≈ 99363.04 * (1 / 66000)`\n    *   `Exponent ≈ 1.5055006`\n\n4.  **Final Factor `Factor = exp(Exponent)`:**\n    *   `Factor ≈ exp(1.5055006)`\n    *   `Factor ≈ 4.506409`\n\nThe code output provided by the user (`4.506409276298925`) is correct. The slight discrepancy in my first run was likely due to a minor transcription or constant value difference. The robust calculation confirms the result is approximately 4.506.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.506. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~1.1\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~2.9\n\nThe value `4.506` is best approximated by `4.5`. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The physical reasoning and application of the Boltzmann equation are sound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`N₂/N₁`) changes as the star's temperature changes. The population of energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (2) to a lower energy level (1) is given by:\n\n`R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n-   `N₂`, `N₁`: Number of atoms in level 2 and level 1.\n-   `g₂`, `g₁`: Statistical weights of the levels (these are constants for the specific transition and atom).\n-   `ΔE`: The energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n-   `k`: The Boltzmann constant (`1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K`).\n-   `T`: The temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratios\n\nWe have two scenarios with different temperatures:\n1.  **No Spots:** Temperature `T_nospots = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R_nospots`.\n    `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n\n2.  **With Spots:** Temperature `T_spots = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R_spots`.\n    `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\n### 3. Finding the Required Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the ratio `R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\n`Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`\n\n`Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\nThe `(g₂ / g₁)` term cancels out:\n\n`Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n\nUsing the exponential property `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots) ]`\n\nThis can be rearranged to make the calculation cleaner:\n\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of a photon associated with a transition is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\n-   `h` (Planck's constant) = `6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n-   `c` (speed of light) = `3.00 × 10⁸ m/s`\n-   `λ` (wavelength) = 1448 Å = `1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n\n`ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ * 3.00 × 10⁸) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the factor equation. The term `ΔE / k` is:\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99446 K`\n\nNow substitute this into the full expression for the factor:\n\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (1 / 5500 - 1 / 6000) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (0.00018181... - 0.00016666...) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 99446 * (0.00001515...) ]`\n`Factor = exp[ 1.506... ]`\n`Factor ≈ 4.509`\n\nThe code output provided a value of `4.506...`, which is very close. This small difference arises from using more precise values for the physical constants, but the conclusion is the same.\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately **4.5**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem is solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio (R) of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n₂) to a lower energy level (n₁) is given by:\n    R = n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    where g₁, g₂ are the statistical weights (constants for a given transition), ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define Ratios for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let T₁ be the temperature without spots: T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   Let T₂ be the effective temperature with spots: T₂ = 5500 K.\n\n    The ratio without spots is:\n    R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n    The ratio with spots is:\n    R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:**\n    The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of R₁ to R₂:\n    Factor = R₁ / R₂\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k*T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k*T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):**\n    The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength λ = 1448 Å.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n    So, the term in the exponent is:\n    ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n5.  **Substitute Values and Compute:**\n    We need to calculate:\n    Factor = exp[ ( (h*c) / (λ*k) ) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T₁ = 6000 K\n    *   T₂ = 5500 K\n\n    The code provided in the thinking process performs this calculation accurately:\n    `exponent = ((h*c) / (λ*k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)`\n    `Factor = exp(exponent)`\n\n    The execution result shows the factor is approximately `4.506`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated factor is ~4.5. This corresponds to option C. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of surface covered by spots is extra data not required for this specific calculation, which directly compares the effect of the two given effective temperatures.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The question asks for the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two different energy levels. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of these levels is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2, respectively.\n    *   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Define the two scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No Spots):** The effective temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.

The population ratio is `Ratio₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the required factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *from* the \"no spots\" case *to* the \"with spots\" case. The problem states that the ratio *decreases* when there are spots, so `Ratio₂ < Ratio₁`. We are looking for the factor `Ratio₁ / Ratio₂`.\n\n    Factor = `Ratio₁ / Ratio₂` = [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is constant and cancels out.\n\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    Using the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), we get:\n\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T₁) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\n    Factor = exp[ ΔE/k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** We are given the wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is 1448 Å (or 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m). The energy difference can be calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light. We can directly calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n\n    ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n5.  **Perform the final calculation:** Now, we plug in the values into the formula derived in step 3. The python code generated in the thinking process performed exactly this calculation:\n\n    *   Constants:\n        *   h (Planck constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   Temperatures:\n        *   T₁ = 6000 K\n        *   T₂ = 5500 K\n    *   Wavelength:\n        *   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    The calculation `exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]` gives a result of approximately 4.5.
