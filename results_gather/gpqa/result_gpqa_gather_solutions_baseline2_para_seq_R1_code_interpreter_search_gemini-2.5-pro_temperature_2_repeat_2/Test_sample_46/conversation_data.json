Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the region above 3300 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an **ester (R-C(=O)-OR')**. The fact that it's slightly lower than the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a simple alkyl ester suggests that the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The signal is a triplet (t), meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). It integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is classic for a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The signal is a quartet (q), meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). It integrates to 2 protons (2H). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (deshielding) of the methylene protons to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Both are doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating, and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating group. An amine (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing group. An ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying with the Options\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. The C=O stretch would be at a much lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show the CH₂ of the propionyl group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate NMR shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch (typically 1715-1750 cm-1), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet represents the -CH3 group split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2 group. The quartet represents the -CH2 group split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, suggesting an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have very different electronic properties. One must be electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm), and the other must be electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  We have a primary amine group (-NH2), which is electron-donating.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    4.  This assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with electron-donating and withdrawing groups.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group alpha to the carbonyl at around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, as an amide, its C=O IR frequency would likely be lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The specific frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This C=O group accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the CH2 group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), likely as part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, as are the two on the other side. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Placing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a -CONH2 (amide) group, not an ester and a primary amine. The IR C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), not the oxygen. The CH2 signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2). The IR would show only one N-H band. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The strong IR band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O double bond, which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (R3N) would show none.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester (typically 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for an amide (usually 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. One is electron-donating (shielding the ortho/meta protons), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho/meta protons).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH2) group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline (aminobenzene) derivative.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester accounts for the C=O from the IR and the ethyl group from the NMR.\n    3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group. The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these groups in a para- (1,4-) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be upfield (shielded), which corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be downfield (deshielded), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The NMR would show a -C(=O)-CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two simple doublets. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so the IR would show only one N-H band, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (around 1735 cm-1), which is slightly lowered by conjugation with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group in an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets that each integrate to 2 protons is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester group, -COOR).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring that is para-substituted (from NMR).\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH2 (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and is an amide, not an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (R-CO-CH2CH3), which would place the quartet signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (which shows a primary amine) and the NMR data (which shows 2 amine protons).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the para-substituted aromatic ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine signals in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an alkyl ester conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and fits an ester perfectly.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (7.0 - 8.0 ppm):**\n        *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring split each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic and Functional Group Region:**\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the tell-tale sign of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n            *   The triplet (t) for 3H is the -CH₃ group, split by the adjacent -CH₂ group.\n            *   The quartet (q) for 2H is the -CH₂ group, split by the adjacent -CH₃ group.\n            *   The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. It indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂-).\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a **b**road **s**inglet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the DBE and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) **. This is an electron-donating group.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together on the para-substituted ring gives us the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Benzene ring (C₆H₄) + amine (NH₂) + ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) = C(6+1+2)H(4+2+5)NO₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. **Matches.**\n*   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester C=O. **Matches.**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl group with -CH₂- at ~4.5 ppm. **Matches.**\n    *   -NH₂ protons as a broad singlet. **Matches.**\n    *   Para-substituted ring pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group will be shielded (upfield), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded (downfield). This perfectly explains the doublet at **7.0 ppm** (ortho to -NH₂) and the doublet at **8.0 ppm** (ortho to -COOEt). **Matches perfectly.**\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has a meta-substitution pattern, inconsistent with the para-pattern (two doublets) in the NMR. Also, the C=O is an amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency in the IR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points align perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThus, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium to strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This rules out structures with secondary amines (-NH-), amides, or nitro groups.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester group (C=O), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's a bit high for a typical conjugated ketone or amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its splitting pattern is a triplet (t). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its splitting is a quartet (q). This indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of this methylene group being attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to quàdrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen bonding. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring must be different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n    Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data (formula C9H11NO2, IR, and all NMR signals).\n    *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Its structure is CH₃CH₂COO-Ar-NH₂. The NMR would show a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The NMR data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-). Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n    *   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n    *   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which is 1 DBE).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of absorptions is highly characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester (conjugated with a benzene ring). It's too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group) shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOEt) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂), which would have a different IR C=O stretch (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex (meta-substitution).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine N-H stretches, conjugated ester C=O stretch, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with one donating and one withdrawing group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This immediately makes option D (a secondary amide, which would only have one N-H stretch) unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amide carbonyls (Options C and D) usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield). This finding rules out option C (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 3-substituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet (t) arises from the -CH3 group being split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 neighbors, n+1=3). The quartet (q) arises from the -CH2- group being split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors, n+1=4). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester or ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group that we identified from the IR spectrum. The signal is broad due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The data points to a molecule with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2) group, and an ethyl group attached to an ester.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this structure against the data one last time.\n        *   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: It has the correct formula C9H11NO2. It has a primary amine and a conjugated ester, matching the IR. It has a para-disubstituted ring, explaining the two doublets in the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons (at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (at 8.0 ppm). The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are also fully consistent.\n    *   Let's see why other options are wrong:\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: In this ester, the ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-C=O. The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR's para-substitution pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester, which is less consistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the two bands observed. It also lacks the signal for a formyl proton (~8-8.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This strongly suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹) but is characteristic of an ester. The position around 1720 cm⁻¹ specifically suggests an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet (3 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet (4 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH3 group). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm indicates this CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is an oxygen atom. This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: -O-CH2-CH3. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH2 group. Combined with the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the -NH2 protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two groups of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (more shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (more deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination**\n\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   Assembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: The ethyl ester group and the amino group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this against the options:\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be -CO-CH2CH3. The CH2 here would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also only has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the aromaticity suggested by the DBE, this value is consistent with a conjugated ester. A typical non-conjugated ester appears around 1735-1750 cm-1; conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing the upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm for its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing the downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm for its ortho protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The 1.20 ppm signal is a triplet (t) because the 3 protons of the methyl (CH3) group are coupled to the 2 protons of the adjacent methylene (CH2) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The 4.5 ppm signal is a quartet (q) because the 2 protons of the methylene (CH2) group are coupled to the 3 protons of the adjacent methyl (CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester or ether. Combined with the C=O group from the IR, an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is highly characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these two groups in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   The electron-donating -NH2 group would shield its ortho protons, pushing them upfield (the signal at 7.0 ppm).\n*   The electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group would deshield its ortho protons, pushing them downfield (the signal at 8.0 ppm). This is a perfect match for the observed aromatic signals.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (wrong IR) and a formyl proton (not in NMR).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: primary amine (IR, NMR), conjugated ester (IR), para-substituted ring with correct electronic effects (NMR), and an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (NMR). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1, not 1720 cm-1) and has meta substitution (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), so the CH2 quartet would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **5**\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is conjugated with a benzene ring. This could be a conjugated ester or ketone. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygen atoms, an **ester (-COO-)** is very likely. An ester C=O conjugated to an aromatic ring typically appears around 1730-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group, following the n+1 rule where 2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃- group, where 3+1=4).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet each):** This distinct pattern of two doublets is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing), creating this symmetrical pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nPlacing these fragments together, the amine group and the ester group must be the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **-COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester):** The -CH₃ gives the triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the -O-CH₂- gives the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This fits.\n*   **-NH₂ (amine):** The two amine protons give the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. This fits.\n*   **Para-substituted ring:** The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, and the amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded (appear upfield), corresponding to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (appear downfield), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This arrangement fits the data perfectly.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure and all spectral data. Correct.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO). Incorrect.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester of phenol (-O-CO-R), not a benzoic acid ester (-CO-O-R). The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet for this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (like in option D) would show only one.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency gives clues to the type of carbonyl group.\n        *   Standard alkyl esters (-COOR) are typically around 1750-1735 cm-1.\n        *   Amides (-CONH2) are typically lower, around 1690-1650 cm-1.\n        *   The value of 1720 cm-1 is slightly low for a simple ester, which suggests the ester group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring (like -NH2) can further lower this frequency. This piece of data points towards a conjugated ester, such as an aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) signifies that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting these two signals together (the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5), we can confidently identify an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The chemical shift of the quartet is consistent with it being part of an ester (-COO-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 hydrogens. This is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons on nitrogen are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The protons near the electron-donating group are shielded (appear at a lower ppm, upfield), while the protons near the electron-withdrawing group are deshielded (appear at a higher ppm, downfield).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    From the fragments identified:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    Let's place these groups on the para-disubstituted ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3.\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group are expected to be upfield (around 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are expected to be downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n    *   This matches the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. All spectral data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Other Options**\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Also, the NMR would have a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm, which is absent.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group) (3+1=4).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 & 4.5 ppm):** The triplet-quartet pair is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms it is an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Shape (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Broadening is common due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet & d, doublet):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split the two protons ortho to the other substituent (and vice versa), resulting in two doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester is formed on the phenyl ring's oxygen, which doesn't match the NMR.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine, not a primary one.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which fits with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (**-NH2**) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but is usually coupled with a lower frequency C=O stretch.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n    *   Combining these two points, the data suggests the presence of both a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is a classic signature for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm).\n        *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on all the evidence, we have:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group. Its NMR signal (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would be around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the broad 2H signal for -NH2 in the NMR.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has a primary amide (-CONH2), which typically has a C=O stretch below 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern would give a more complex set of signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Conclusion**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately points away from options containing secondary amines (like option D).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with the aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). This frequency is generally too high for an amide (like options C and D), which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). This rules out option C, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The critical piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This high, downfield value means the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester or ether. In the context of an ester (-COOR), this indicates an ethyl group attached to the oxygen (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to exchange and the electrical quadrupole of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these pieces can only result in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options provided.\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data. It has the correct molecular formula, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring with the expected electronic effects reflected in the NMR.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This is an isomer where the structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this case, the NMR quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the ester oxygen, and would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), which contradicts the observed spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is a primary amide, not an ester (contradicts IR), and it is meta-substituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine (contradicts IR).\n\nAll candidate analyses correctly reason that the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The correct choice is therefore option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the region above 3300 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an **ester (R-C(=O)-OR')**. The fact that it's slightly lower than the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a simple alkyl ester suggests that the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The signal is a triplet (t), meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). It integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is classic for a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The signal is a quartet (q), meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). It integrates to 2 protons (2H). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (deshielding) of the methylene protons to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Both are doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating, and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating group. An amine (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing group. An ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying with the Options\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. The C=O stretch would be at a much lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show the CH₂ of the propionyl group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate NMR shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch (typically 1715-1750 cm-1), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet represents the -CH3 group split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2 group. The quartet represents the -CH2 group split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, suggesting an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have very different electronic properties. One must be electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm), and the other must be electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  We have a primary amine group (-NH2), which is electron-donating.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    4.  This assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with electron-donating and withdrawing groups.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group alpha to the carbonyl at around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, as an amide, its C=O IR frequency would likely be lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The specific frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This C=O group accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the CH2 group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), likely as part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, as are the two on the other side. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Placing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a -CONH2 (amide) group, not an ester and a primary amine. The IR C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), not the oxygen. The CH2 signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2). The IR would show only one N-H band. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The strong IR band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O double bond, which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (R3N) would show none.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester (typically 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for an amide (usually 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. One is electron-donating (shielding the ortho/meta protons), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho/meta protons).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH2) group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline (aminobenzene) derivative.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester accounts for the C=O from the IR and the ethyl group from the NMR.\n    3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group. The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these groups in a para- (1,4-) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be upfield (shielded), which corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be downfield (deshielded), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The NMR would show a -C(=O)-CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two simple doublets. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so the IR would show only one N-H band, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (around 1735 cm-1), which is slightly lowered by conjugation with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group in an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.

The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester group, -COOR).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring that is para-substituted (from NMR).\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH2 (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and is an amide, not an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (R-CO-CH2CH3), which would place the quartet signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (which shows a primary amine) and the NMR data (which shows 2 amine protons).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the para-substituted aromatic ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine signals in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an alkyl ester conjugated with an aromatic ring.

Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the DBE and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) **. This is an electron-donating group.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together on the para-substituted ring gives us the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Benzene ring (C₆H₄) + amine (NH₂) + ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) = C(6+1+2)H(4+2+5)NO₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. **Matches.**\n*   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester C=O. **Matches.**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl group with -CH₂- at ~4.5 ppm. **Matches.**\n    *   -NH₂ protons as a broad singlet. **Matches.**\n    *   Para-substituted ring pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group will be shielded (upfield), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded (downfield). This perfectly explains the doublet at **7.0 ppm** (ortho to -NH₂) and the doublet at **8.0 ppm** (ortho to -COOEt). **Matches perfectly.**\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has a meta-substitution pattern, inconsistent with the para-pattern (two doublets) in the NMR. Also, the C=O is an amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency in the IR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points align perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThus, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium to strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This rules out structures with secondary amines (-NH-), amides, or nitro groups.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region.

It's a bit high for a typical conjugated ketone or amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its splitting pattern is a triplet (t). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its splitting is a quartet (q). This indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of this methylene group being attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to quàdrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen bonding. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring must be different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.

Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Its structure is CH₃CH₂COO-Ar-NH₂. The NMR would show a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The NMR data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-).

The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester (conjugated with a benzene ring). It's too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group) shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOEt) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂), which would have a different IR C=O stretch (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex (meta-substitution).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine N-H stretches, conjugated ester C=O stretch, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with one donating and one withdrawing group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This immediately makes option D (a secondary amide, which would only have one N-H stretch) unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amide carbonyls (Options C and D) usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield). This finding rules out option C (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 3-substituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet (t) arises from the -CH3 group being split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 neighbors, n+1=3). The quartet (q) arises from the -CH2- group being split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors, n+1=4). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester or ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group that we identified from the IR spectrum. The signal is broad due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The data points to a molecule with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2) group, and an ethyl group attached to an ester.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this structure against the data one last time.\n        *   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: It has the correct formula C9H11NO2. It has a primary amine and a conjugated ester, matching the IR. It has a para-disubstituted ring, explaining the two doublets in the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons (at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (at 8.0 ppm). The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are also fully consistent.\n    *   Let's see why other options are wrong:\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: In this ester, the ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-C=O. The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR's para-substitution pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester, which is less consistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the two bands observed. It also lacks the signal for a formyl proton (~8-8.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This strongly suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹) but is characteristic of an ester. The position around 1720 cm⁻¹ specifically suggests an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet (3 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet (4 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH3 group). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm indicates this CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is an oxygen atom. This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: -O-CH2-CH3. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH2 group. Combined with the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the -NH2 protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two groups of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (more shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (more deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination**\n\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   Assembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: The ethyl ester group and the amino group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this against the options:\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be -CO-CH2CH3. The CH2 here would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also only has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the aromaticity suggested by the DBE, this value is consistent with a conjugated ester. A typical non-conjugated ester appears around 1735-1750 cm-1; conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing the upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm for its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing the downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm for its ortho protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The 1.20 ppm signal is a triplet (t) because the 3 protons of the methyl (CH3) group are coupled to the 2 protons of the adjacent methylene (CH2) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The 4.5 ppm signal is a quartet (q) because the 2 protons of the methylene (CH2) group are coupled to the 3 protons of the adjacent methyl (CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester or ether. Combined with the C=O group from the IR, an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is highly characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these two groups in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   The electron-donating -NH2 group would shield its ortho protons, pushing them upfield (the signal at 7.0 ppm).\n*   The electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group would deshield its ortho protons, pushing them downfield (the signal at 8.0 ppm). This is a perfect match for the observed aromatic signals.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (wrong IR) and a formyl proton (not in NMR).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: primary amine (IR, NMR), conjugated ester (IR), para-substituted ring with correct electronic effects (NMR), and an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (NMR). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1, not 1720 cm-1) and has meta substitution (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), so the CH2 quartet would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **5**\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is conjugated with a benzene ring. This could be a conjugated ester or ketone. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygen atoms, an **ester (-COO-)** is very likely. An ester C=O conjugated to an aromatic ring typically appears around 1730-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group, following the n+1 rule where 2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃- group, where 3+1=4).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet each):** This distinct pattern of two doublets is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing), creating this symmetrical pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nPlacing these fragments together, the amine group and the ester group must be the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **-COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester):** The -CH₃ gives the triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the -O-CH₂- gives the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This fits.\n*   **-NH₂ (amine):** The two amine protons give the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. This fits.\n*   **Para-substituted ring:** The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, and the amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded (appear upfield), corresponding to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (appear downfield), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This arrangement fits the data perfectly.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure and all spectral data. Correct.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO). Incorrect.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester of phenol (-O-CO-R), not a benzoic acid ester (-CO-O-R). The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet for this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (like in option D) would show only one.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency gives clues to the type of carbonyl group.\n        *   Standard alkyl esters (-COOR) are typically around 1750-1735 cm-1.\n        *   Amides (-CONH2) are typically lower, around 1690-1650 cm-1.\n        *   The value of 1720 cm-1 is slightly low for a simple ester, which suggests the ester group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring (like -NH2) can further lower this frequency. This piece of data points towards a conjugated ester, such as an aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) signifies that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting these two signals together (the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5), we can confidently identify an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The chemical shift of the quartet is consistent with it being part of an ester (-COO-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 hydrogens. This is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons on nitrogen are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The protons near the electron-donating group are shielded (appear at a lower ppm, upfield), while the protons near the electron-withdrawing group are deshielded (appear at a higher ppm, downfield).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    From the fragments identified:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    Let's place these groups on the para-disubstituted ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3.\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group are expected to be upfield (around 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are expected to be downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n    *   This matches the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. All spectral data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Other Options**\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Also, the NMR would have a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm, which is absent.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group) (3+1=4).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 & 4.5 ppm):** The triplet-quartet pair is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms it is an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Shape (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Broadening is common due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet & d, doublet):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split the two protons ortho to the other substituent (and vice versa), resulting in two doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester is formed on the phenyl ring's oxygen, which doesn't match the NMR.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine, not a primary one.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which fits with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (**-NH2**) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but is usually coupled with a lower frequency C=O stretch.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n    *   Combining these two points, the data suggests the presence of both a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is a classic signature for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm).\n        *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on all the evidence, we have:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group. Its NMR signal (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would be around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the broad 2H signal for -NH2 in the NMR.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has a primary amide (-CONH2), which typically has a C=O stretch below 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern would give a more complex set of signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
