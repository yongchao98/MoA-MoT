This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relevant form for position and momentum is:\n    Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where `Δx` is the uncertainty in position, `Δp_x` is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction, and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x)**: We are asked to estimate the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality from the principle:\n    Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Given values are:\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    \n    Plugging these in:\n    Δp_x = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m) = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**: We need a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p). Since the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

Substituting these into the derivative gives:\n    dE/dp = (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) = v\n    This simple result shows that a small change in energy is related to a small change in momentum by the particle's velocity:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas:** Now we can substitute the expression for Δp from the uncertainty principle (Step 2) into our energy-momentum uncertainty relation (Step 3).\n    *   ΔE = v ⋅ Δp\n    *   Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n    *   Therefore: ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We have all the necessary values to calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy.\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    The calculation was performed using the provided Python script:\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values\n    v = 2 * 10**8  # velocity in m/s\n    delta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # uncertainty in position in m\n\n    # Constants\n    h_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n    # using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n    delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n    # using the relation: delta_E = v * delta_p\n    delta_E = v * delta_p\n\n    print(f\"{delta_E:.3e} J\")\n    ```\n    The output from the code execution is `1.055e-16 J`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 1.055 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.

This points directly to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relevant form for position and momentum is:\n    Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where `Δx` is the uncertainty in position, `Δp_x` is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction, and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x)**: We are asked to estimate the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality from the principle:\n    Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Given values are:\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    \n    Plugging these in:\n    Δp_x = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m) = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**: We need a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p). Since the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation. However, a simpler differential relationship exists that works in both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n    The change in energy (dE) with respect to a change in momentum (dp) is given by `dE/dp`.
