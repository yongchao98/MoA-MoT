    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem requires us to determine the nature of an absorption line observed at a cosmological distance by finding its corresponding rest-frame energy.\n\n1.  **Find the Redshift (z):** The distance is given as 2.1 Gpc. We need to convert this distance to a redshift. Using standard cosmological models (like the ΛCDM model with H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc), a proper distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a redshift of approximately z ≈ 0.57.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):** The observed energy (E_obs) is related to the rest-frame energy (E_rest) by the redshift:\n    E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\n    Given:\n    E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n    z ≈ 0.57\n\n    Calculation:\n    E_rest ≈ (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.57)\n    E_rest ≈ (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.57\n    E_rest ≈ 6.12 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n3.  **Identify the Transition:** We need to find a common transition in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way that has an energy of about 6.12 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n    Let's consider the famous 21 cm line, which is a hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\n    *   Frequency (f) = 1420.4 MHz = 1.4204 * 10⁹ Hz\n    *   Energy (E) = h * f, where h is Planck's constant (h ≈ 4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s)\n    *   E = (4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 * 10⁹ s⁻¹)\n    *   E ≈ 5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated rest-frame energy (≈ 6.12 * 10⁻⁶ eV) is very close to the energy of the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (≈ 5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV). The small discrepancy is due to the precise cosmological parameters used for the distance-to-redshift conversion. The 21 cm line is the primary tracer of the **cold atomic interstellar medium**.\n\nTherefore, the absorption line observed in the Milky Way would be that of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<B>>>",
