    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we need to identify which ones are chiral (non-superimposable on their mirror images).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and carboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') restricts the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and its mirror image is non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. This molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Because it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion as well as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>",
