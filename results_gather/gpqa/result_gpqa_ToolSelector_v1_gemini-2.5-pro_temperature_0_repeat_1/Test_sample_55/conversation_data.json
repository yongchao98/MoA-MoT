    "An electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m. The rules are:\n1.  $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   Initial state: $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n < 0$: The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is allowed.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   Final state: $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check if the possible intermediate states can decay to this final state:\n    *   From $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is satisfied if $m'$ is -1, 0, or 1.\n*   All three intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, all the routes proposed in the options are physically possible.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n\n*   The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the decay must be isotropic. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the available final substates.\n*   The available intermediate states are the three magnetic substates of the $l=1$ level: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n*   Since there are three equally probable intermediate states, the probability of the atom decaying into any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The second step of the transition, from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only dipole-allowed decay path from the 2p level. Therefore, this transition occurs with a probability of 1.\n*   The overall probability for a specific cascade, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Comparing with the Options:**\n\n*   A) ... and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) ... and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) ... and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to a final state via an electric dipole transition is governed by the selection rules: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. The transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ must occur in at least two steps, as a direct transition would have $\\Delta l = 0$, which is forbidden for a dipole transition.\n\n**Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   Initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   The transition from $l'=1$ to the final state $l=0$ satisfies $\\Delta l = -1$.\n*   The transition from $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ to $m=0$ satisfies $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   So, all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This implies that the atom will transition into each of the three possible magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ level with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three equally likely intermediate states, the probability (or branching ratio) for the atom to take any specific path (e.g., through $|2,1,0\\rangle$) is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe second step of the decay, from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only allowed dipole transition from the 2p level, so it occurs with probability 1.\n\nThe overall probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options, option D is the only one that matches this result.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
