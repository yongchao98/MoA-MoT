    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property is crucial: the probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes. We simply need to calculate the probability that a new atom of this type would decay within a 150-minute period.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:** The probability of decay, `P(t)`, within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\n    Rearranging this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of it *decaying*, we subtract this from 1:\n    `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
