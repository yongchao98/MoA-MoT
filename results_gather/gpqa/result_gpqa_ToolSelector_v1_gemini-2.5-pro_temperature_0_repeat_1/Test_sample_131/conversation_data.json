    "This problem requires analyzing the 1H NMR spectra of the potential compounds to see which mixture matches the given data. Let's break down the expected spectrum for each compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the individual compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** All four protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3- protons will be a triplet. The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**2. Analyze the mixture:**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 mixture with the following spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). Combining these gives **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. This would result in a total of three aromatic singlets. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. This would result in a total of three aromatic singlets. (Does not match)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce triplets and quartets, not just singlets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio) is the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nBased on the analysis of the molecular structures and their expected 1H NMR spectra:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** is highly symmetrical and will show one singlet for its two aromatic protons (2H) and one singlet for its four equivalent methyl groups (12H).\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has a plane of symmetry and will show one singlet for its two aromatic protons (2H) and two singlets for its two pairs of equivalent methyl groups (6H each).\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** would show two singlets in the aromatic region, which when combined with another compound would likely result in more than two total aromatic signals.\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene** is eliminated because its ethyl groups would produce quartets and triplets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nNow, consider a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** You would see the singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This gives two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio, which matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** You would see the singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This gives a total of three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
