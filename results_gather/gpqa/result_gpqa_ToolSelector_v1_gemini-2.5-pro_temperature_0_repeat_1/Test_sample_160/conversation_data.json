    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the two scenarios for mean free path (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *other gas molecules*. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons from the beam colliding with *gas molecules*.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = 1 / (nσ), where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a projectile sees for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In a gas, all molecules are moving. To account for the relative motion between the colliding molecules, the standard kinetic theory formula for MFP includes a factor of the square root of 2.\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the density of gas molecules and `σ_gg` is the cross-section for a gas-gas collision, which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   The electrons in a 1000 kV TEM are moving at relativistic speeds (over 90% the speed of light), which is orders of magnitude faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be essentially stationary targets.\n    *   When the projectile is moving much faster than the targets, the √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Here, `n` is the same density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the cross-section for an electron-gas collision.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg:** This is a \"hard-sphere\" type collision between two neutral molecules. The cross-section is determined by their physical diameters.\n    *   **σ_eg:** This is the scattering of a tiny, high-energy electron by a gas molecule. Because the electron is a point-like particle and is moving very fast, it can pass very close to or even through the electron cloud of the gas molecule without a significant interaction (collision). The effective target area it \"sees\" is much smaller than the physical area presented by one gas molecule to another.\n    *   Therefore, it is a sound physical conclusion that the electron-gas collision cross-section is smaller than the gas-gas collision cross-section: **σ_eg < σ_gg**.\n\n6.  **Combine the analyses to compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg).\n    *   Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414 and we established that σ_gg > σ_eg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n    *   This means that λ2 / λ1 > 1.414.\n    *   Therefore, we can definitively conclude that **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: False.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True. Since λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False. Our result shows λ2 is much larger than 1.22*λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: False.\n\nThe electron's mean free path is significantly longer than the gas molecules' mean free path primarily because the gas molecules are effectively stationary from the electron's perspective (removing the √2 factor) and the electron presents a much smaller collision cross-section.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem requires comparing the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) to the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path (MFP) of Gas Molecules (λ1):** The standard formula from kinetic theory for molecules in a gas is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where `n` is the number density of gas molecules and `σ_gg` is the gas-gas collision cross-section. The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them travel at relativistic speeds, far faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Thus, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The MFP formula for a fast projectile hitting stationary targets is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas collision cross-section. Note the absence of the √2 factor.\n\n3.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:** The ratio of the two mean free paths is:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)] = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Comparing Cross-Sections:** A collision between two gas molecules (σ_gg) is like a \"billiard ball\" collision, dependent on their physical size. A collision between a tiny, high-energy electron and a gas molecule (σ_eg) is a scattering event. The electron is much smaller than the gas molecule, and its high energy means it must pass very close to the nucleus or an electron to be significantly scattered. Therefore, the effective cross-section for an electron-gas collision is considerably smaller than for a gas-gas collision (σ_eg < σ_gg).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since √2 ≈ 1.414 and the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1, the overall ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than 1.414.\n    λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1 -> False.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> True, as any value greater than 1.414 is also greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> False.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 -> False.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
