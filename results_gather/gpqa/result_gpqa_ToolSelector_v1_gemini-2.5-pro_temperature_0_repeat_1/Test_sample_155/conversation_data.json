    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of each reaction and an understanding of how different types of chromatography separate stereoisomers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  mCPBA: This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. Epoxidation of a trans-alkene results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    2.  Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺): This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening) results in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for the anti-addition of a symmetric reagent to an alkene is:\n    *   (E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for the anti-addition of a symmetric reagent to an alkene is:\n    *   (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the Chromatograms\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will separate into distinct peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not separate; they will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will produce one peak, and the racemic pair of enantiomers will produce a second peak.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other, producing two additional, distinct peaks.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem requires analyzing the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and then determining how the resulting mixture of stereoisomers will behave during chromatographic separation.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\nThis two-step sequence is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. Applying the stereochemical rule for this reaction type:\n*   (E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound.\nReaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\nThis is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule is:\n*   (Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture.\nReaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture:**\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers: the meso-diol, and the pair of (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two.\n\n**Chromatographic Analysis:**\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This method separates diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n    *   Result: **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method can separate all stereoisomers: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n    *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n    *   Peak 2: The (4R,5R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Peak 3: The (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   Result: **3 peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
