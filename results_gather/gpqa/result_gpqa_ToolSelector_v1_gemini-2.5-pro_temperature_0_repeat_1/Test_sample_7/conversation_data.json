    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single knock-out mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). This indicates G2 is essential for the resistance phenotype.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance. The phenotype of these double mutants is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   In genetics, when the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., `g1g2`) is the same as the phenotype of one of the single mutants (`g2`), that gene (G2) is considered **epistatic** to the other gene (G1). This means G2's function masks the function of G1.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of them in the genetic pathway. Given that we know one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the clear candidate. This eliminates option B.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Genes G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), meaning they both contribute to the trait.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has a resistance of 10%. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes. This is known as a **synthetic interaction**, which suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. Knocking out both pathways has a much stronger effect than knocking out just one.\n    *   Let's evaluate the descriptions of this interaction in the remaining options (A, C, D):\n        *   **\"Gene redundancy\" (Option A):** This is the most plausible description. While not classic full redundancy (where single mutants would have a wild-type phenotype), G1 and G3 have partially redundant functions in the sense that they operate in parallel to achieve the same outcome (resistance).\n        *   **\"Pleiotropy\" (Option C):** Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n        *   **\"Same promoter\" (Option D):** There is no data in the experiment to make any conclusion about the physical structure of the genes, like their promoters.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the final clause regarding epistasis between G1 and G3:**\n    *   Options A and C claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would have to be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is false.\n    *   Option D claims \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) would have to be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also false.\n    *   It appears there is an error in the third clause of all the viable options.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Option:** We must choose the option that is most consistent with the data, even if it's not perfect.\n    *   Option A states: G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 show redundancy (Plausible description of their parallel function), G1 is epistatic to G3 (Incorrect).\n    *   Option C states: G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 show pleiotropy (Unsupported), G1 is epistatic to G3 (Incorrect).\n    *   Option D states: G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 have the same promoter (Unsupported), G3 is epistatic to G1 (Incorrect).\n\nComparing these, Option A is the strongest choice. It correctly identifies the main regulator (G2) and provides the most reasonable biological description for the interaction between the other two genes (\"gene redundancy\" as a term for parallel pathways), despite having an incorrect final statement. The other options rely on unsupported claims.\n\n<<<A>>>",
