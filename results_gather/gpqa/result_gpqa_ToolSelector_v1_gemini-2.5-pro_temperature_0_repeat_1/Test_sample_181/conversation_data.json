    "<<<\nACTION: SEARCH\nGUIDANCE:\n<search>assumptions for Mott-Gurney law validity</search>\n>>>\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe Mott-Gurney law describes the current in a specific regime known as space-charge-limited current (SCLC). The derivation of this law relies on several key assumptions about the device and the material:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other carrier type is negligible.\n2.  **Trap-Free Material:** The semiconductor or insulator is assumed to be perfectly insulating and free of charge-trapping states within the bandgap. If traps are present, the equation changes, leading to trap-limited SCLC.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact / No Injection Barrier:** The model requires an \"Ohmic\" injecting contact. This means the contact can supply an unlimited number of carriers into the device, so the current is not limited by the injection process but by the charge buildup (space charge) in the bulk of the material. This is equivalent to saying there is no energy barrier for carrier injection.\n4.  **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The current is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current component due to diffusion (carrier movement from high to low concentration) is considered negligible. This is a valid approximation for sufficiently large applied voltages.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these assumptions:\n\n*   **A) ... a two-carrier device...** This is incorrect. The model is for a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) ... a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly includes all the key assumptions: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (the ideal Ohmic contact condition), and negligible diffusion.\n*   **C) ... a Schottky contact...** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact is typically a rectifying contact that creates an energy barrier, which would limit injection. The Mott-Gurney law assumes an injection-unlimited (Ohmic) contact.\n*   **D) ... negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a drift current. Negligible drift current would imply almost no current flow. The assumption is that diffusion current is negligible, not drift current.\n\nTherefore, statement B is the most accurate description of the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe provided information confirms the context of the question. Specifically, evidence item 5 states, \"The Mott–Gurney law, where a trap-free semiconductor...\". This directly supports one of the key assumptions for the validity of the equation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on the fundamental principles of the Mott-Gurney law, which were correctly identified in the initial reasoning step:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes current is dominated by one type of carrier (electrons or holes).\n2.  **Trap-Free:** The material is assumed to have no trap states that would capture carriers and reduce the current.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** The contact must be able to supply enough carriers so that the current is limited by the bulk properties (the space charge), not by the injection process.\n4.  **Drift-Dominated Current:** The current from carrier drift in the electric field is assumed to be much larger than the current from diffusion.\n\nAnalyzing the choices:\n*   A) \"two-carrier device\" - Incorrect. The law is for single-carrier devices.\n*   B) \"trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current\" - This statement accurately combines all the necessary conditions for the classic Mott-Gurney law.\n*   C) \"Schottky contact\" - Incorrect. A Schottky contact typically forms a barrier that limits injection, violating a key assumption.\n*   D) \"negligible drift current\" - Incorrect. The SCLC is a drift current. The assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible.\n\nThe initial analysis was correct, and the new evidence supports it. Option B provides the most complete and accurate description of the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
