    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving constants from physics.\n\n1.  **Identify the particle:** The nucleus is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number Z=3 (3 protons). The problem states it also has 3 neutrons. Therefore, the mass number A (total number of protons and neutrons) is A = 3 + 3 = 6. The nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The speed is given as `v = 0.96c`. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28`\n    `γ = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714`\n\n3.  **Calculate the rest energy (E₀):** The rest energy is `E₀ = m₀c²`, where `m₀` is the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. There are a few ways to approximate this:\n    *   Using the precise mass of the ⁶Li nucleus (which accounts for binding energy).\n    *   Summing the masses of its constituents (3 protons and 3 neutrons).\n    *   Approximating the mass as A times the mass of a nucleon.\n\n    Let's test the approximation where the mass of the nucleus is taken as A times the mass of a neutron. This is a common simplification in some contexts. The rest energy of a neutron is approximately `mₙc² ≈ 939.565 MeV`.\n    `E₀ ≈ A * mₙc² = 6 * 939.565 MeV = 5637.39 MeV = 5.63739 GeV`\n\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E):** The total energy is given by the formula `E = γ * E₀`.\n    `E = (25/7) * 5.63739 GeV ≈ 20.1335 GeV`\n\n5.  **Compare with options:** This result, `20.1335 GeV`, is extremely close to option A, `20.132 GeV`. The minor difference is likely due to the specific value of the neutron mass used. This confirms that this calculation method is the intended one.\n\nThe calculation is non-trivial and requires specific physical constants, making the `CODE` action the most appropriate choice to ensure precision.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_relativistic_energy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total relativistic energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus\n    traveling at 0.96c.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light\n    v_over_c = 0.96\n\n    # Mass number (A) of the nucleus (3 protons + 3 neutrons)\n    A = 6\n\n    # Rest energy of a neutron in MeV (CODATA 2018 value)\n    # This approximation for the nucleus's rest mass is chosen as it\n    # leads directly to one of the multiple-choice answers.\n    m_n_mev = 939.56542052\n\n    # 1.

    "The calculation performed by the code confirms the initial analysis.\n\n1.  **Particle Identification:** The nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), with a mass number A=6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons).\n2.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** For a speed of `v = 0.96c`, the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) ≈ 3.5714`.\n3.  **Rest Energy (E₀):** The rest energy of the nucleus is approximated by multiplying its mass number (A=6) by the rest energy of a nucleon (the code used the neutron's rest energy, ~939.565 MeV). This gives a rest energy `E₀ ≈ 6 * 939.565 MeV ≈ 5.6374 GeV`.\n4.  **Total Energy (E):** The total relativistic energy is `E = γ * E₀`.\n    `E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6374 GeV ≈ 20.1335 GeV`.\n\nThis calculated value of `20.1335 GeV` is extremely close to option A, `20.132 GeV`. The minor discrepancy is due to the approximation of the nucleus's mass, which neglects the binding energy. The result is clearly intended to be option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
