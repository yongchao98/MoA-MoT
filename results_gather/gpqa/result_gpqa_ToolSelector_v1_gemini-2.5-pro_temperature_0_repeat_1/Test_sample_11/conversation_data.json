    "This is a classic two-body decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion ($\\pi^+$), which is $E_i = m_\\pi c^2$. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$), $E_f = E_\\mu + E_\\nu$.\n    $m_\\pi c^2 = E_\\mu + E_\\nu$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    $|\\vec{p}_\\mu| = |\\vec{p}_\\nu| = p$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** For any particle, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_\\mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2$\n    *   For the neutrino (which is considered massless in this context): $E_\\nu = pc$\n\n4.  **Solving for Kinetic Energies:** We can combine these equations to solve for the kinetic energy of the muon ($K_\\mu$).

    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle ($\\pi^+$) into two product particles ($\\mu^+$ and a neutrino). We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   Particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$)\n*   Status: Stationary (at rest)\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$): Rest energy of the pion, $E_i = m_\\pi c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): 0\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   Particles: Muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$)\n*   The particles move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude ($p$) to conserve momentum.\n*   Final Energy ($E_f$): Sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino, $E_f = E_\\mu + E_\\nu$.\n*   Final Momentum ($p_f$): 0\n\n**3. Conservation Laws:**\n*   **Energy Conservation:** $E_i = E_f \\implies m_\\pi c^2 = E_\\mu + E_\\nu$\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** $p_i = p_f \\implies |\\vec{p}_\\mu| = |\\vec{p}_\\nu| = p$\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculations:**\nThe total energy of a particle is given by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_\\mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2$\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$), which is effectively massless: $E_\\nu = pc$\n\nFrom energy conservation, we can write $E_\\nu = m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu$. Since $E_\\nu = pc$, we have $pc = m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu$.\nSubstitute this into the muon's energy equation:\n$E_\\mu^2 = (m_\\pi c^2 - E_\\mu)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2$\n$E_\\mu^2 = (m_\\pi c^2)^2 - 2(m_\\pi c^2)E_\\mu + E_\\mu^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2$\nSolving for $E_\\mu$:\n$E_\\mu = \\frac{(m_\\pi c^2)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2}{2 m_\\pi c^2}$\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon ($K_\\mu$) is its total energy minus its rest energy: $K_\\mu = E_\\mu - m_\\mu c^2$.\nA more direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive daughter particle is:\n$K_\\mu = \\frac{(m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2)^2}{2 m_\\pi c^2}$\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   $m_\\pi c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_\\mu c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n$K_\\mu = \\frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{(33.9)^2}{279.2} = \\frac{1149.21}{279.2} \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses:\n$Q = K_\\mu + K_\\nu = m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino ($K_\\nu$) is the remaining energy:\n$K_\\nu = Q - K_\\mu = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78$ MeV $\\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
