    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid group, as the [COOH]⁺ fragment has a mass of 45 (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H).\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n*   The combined evidence from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and C (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   We are left with A (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n*   The FTIR and ¹H NMR data both confirm the presence of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n**Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation helps determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   An alkene's C=C bond accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, our unknown compound must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is consistent with one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, but not the C=C bond required by the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl group and the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<A>>>",
