    "To find the mean decay distance, we use the formula:\nd = γ * β * c * τ\n\nWhere:\n*   **τ** is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n*   **γ** is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **β** is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (v/c).\n\nThe term **cτ** is the proper decay length, which can be calculated from the decay width **Γ** using the relation derived from the uncertainty principle:\ncτ = ħc / Γ\nwhere **ħc** (h-bar c) is a physical constant approximately equal to 197.327 MeV·fm.\n\nThe term **γβ** can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\nWe also know that p = γmβc, which means pc = γβmc².\nTherefore, γβ = pc / mc².\n\nFirst, let's calculate **pc**:\npc = √(E² - (mc²)²)\npc = √((8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²)\npc = √(64 - 1.44) GeV\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV\n\nNow, calculate **γβ**:\nγβ = pc / mc²\nγβ = 7.9095 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.591\n\nNext, calculate the proper decay length **cτ**. We must use consistent units. Let's use MeV.\nΓ = 320 MeV\nħc ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm\ncτ = 197.327 MeV·fm / 320 MeV ≈ 0.6166 fm\n\nFinally, calculate the mean decay distance **d**:\nd = (γβ) * (cτ)\nd ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 4.062 fm\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.062 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThe code output provides a more precise calculation: 4.0645 * 10⁻¹⁵ m. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
