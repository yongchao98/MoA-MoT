    "<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\nThe solution involves calculating the ratio of the transit probabilities for the two planets.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability (`p`) of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`), assuming a random inclination. For a circular orbit, this is `p = R_s / a`.\n\n2.  **Probability Ratio:** We want to find the ratio `p_1 / p_2`.\n    `p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    Since the problem states the stellar radii are the same (`R_s1 = R_s2`), the formula simplifies to:\n    `p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (`P`), semi-major axis (`a`), and stellar mass (`M_s`):\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    Therefore, `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substituting Known Values:** We are given:\n    *   `P_2 = 3 * P_1`\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ ((3*P_1)^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * (2*M_s2)) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (9 * P_1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P_1^2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n    The `P_1^2` and `M_s2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The ratio of probabilities `p_1 / p_2` is equal to `4.5^(1/3)`. The following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the transit probabilities p1/p2 is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1.\n# From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3).\n# Therefore, a2/a1 = [ (P2^2 * Ms2) / (P1^2 * Ms1) ]^(1/3).\n# We are given P2 = 3 * P1 and Ms1 = 2 * Ms2.\n# Let's define the ratios:\nP2_over_P1 = 3.0\nMs1_over_Ms2 = 2.0\n\n# The ratio of the squared periods is (P2/P1)^2\nratio_of_periods_squared = P2_over_P1**2\n\n# The ratio of the stellar masses is Ms1/Ms2\nratio_of_masses = Ms1_over_Ms2\n\n# The ratio of probabilities p1/p2 = a2/a1 is:\n# ( (P2/P1)^2 / (Ms1/Ms2) )^(1/3)\nprobability_ratio_p1_over_p2 = (ratio_of_periods_squared / ratio_of_masses)**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 (p1/p2) is: {probability_ratio_p1_over_p2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This means Planet_1 is preferred.\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe transit probability `p` is proportional to the stellar radius `R_s` divided by the planet's orbital semi-major axis `a` (`p ∝ R_s / a`).\n\nWe are given:\n-   The stellar radii are the same: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n-   The orbital period of Planet 2 is three times that of Planet 1: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n-   The mass of the star hosting Planet 1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n`p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nSince `R_s1 = R_s2`, this simplifies to:\n`p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law: `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`.\nThis means `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`.\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the given relationships:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ ((3*P_1)^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * (2*M_s2)) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (9 * P_1^2 * M_s2) / (2 * P_1^2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `P_1^2` and `M_s2` terms cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the probabilities `p_1 / p_2` is approximately 1.65. This means Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2, making it the preferred target for observation. This matches option B.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>"
