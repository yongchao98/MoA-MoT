    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. \"Grounded\" means the potential on the sphere's surface is zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To solve this, we can replace the conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to make the potential zero on the spherical surface of radius `R`. The standard formulas are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. A key formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charges are not a fixed source; their distribution changes as `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\n4.  **Calculating V_induced:** The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential at `q`'s location due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy:** Now, we substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
