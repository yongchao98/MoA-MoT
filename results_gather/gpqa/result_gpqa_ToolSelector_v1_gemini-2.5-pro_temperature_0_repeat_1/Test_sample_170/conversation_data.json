    "To determine the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    First, we classify the substituents as either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   **Ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The groups are:\n        *   -CH₃ (1, Toluene)\n        *   -C₂H₅ (5, Ethylbenzene)\n        *   -Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)\n    *   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are also deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The groups are:\n        *   -COOC₂H₅ (2, Ethyl benzoate)\n        *   -NO₂ (4, Nitrobenzene)\n        *   -COOH (6, Benzoic acid)\n\n    Based on this, the substances with meta-directing groups {2, 4, 6} will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the sequence, followed by the substances with ortho/para-directing groups {1, 3, 5}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta-Directing Groups:**\n    These groups produce very little para product. The amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group.\n    *   **-NO₂ (4):** This is the most strongly deactivating group. It directs almost exclusively to the meta position, resulting in the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-COOH (6):** This is a strongly deactivating group.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (2):** This is also a strongly deactivating group, similar in strength to -COOH, but generally considered slightly less deactivating.\n    Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: -NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅.\n    This corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:**\n    For these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is high. The order depends on the ratio of para to ortho product, which is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** These are activating alkyl groups. The choice between the ortho and para positions is primarily governed by steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased bulk hinders attack at the adjacent ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the product being the less-hindered para-isomer. Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1).\n    *   **-Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall, they are ortho/para directors. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho position more strongly than the para position. This makes the para position relatively more reactive, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer (typically around 89% for bromination), which is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    Thus, the order of increasing para yield is: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl.\n    This corresponds to the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Orders:**\n    By combining the two ranked groups, we get the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n    (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n    The complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n1.  **Separate into Meta and Ortho/Para Directors:**\n    *   Meta-directing groups yield very little para-isomer. These are: -NO₂ (4), -COOH (6), and -COOC₂H₅ (2).\n    *   Ortho/para-directing groups yield a high proportion of para-isomer. These are: -CH₃ (1), -C₂H₅ (5), and -Cl (3).\n    *   Therefore, the final order will have {4, 6, 2} followed by {1, 5, 3}.\n\n2.  **Order the Meta Directors:**\n    The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group.\n    *   -NO₂ (4) is the strongest deactivator, giving the least para product.\n    *   -COOH (6) is the next strongest deactivator.\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (2) is slightly less deactivating than -COOH.\n    *   The order of increasing para yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n3.  **Order the Ortho/Para Directors:**\n    The para/ortho ratio determines the yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   For alkyl groups (-CH₃ and -C₂H₅), steric hindrance is the main factor. The bulkier ethyl group (5) favors the para position more than the methyl group (1). So, para yield is higher for 5 than for 1.\n    *   For the halogen -Cl (3), its strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho position more than the para position, leading to a very high para yield, higher than for both alkylbenzenes.\n    *   The order of increasing para yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the sequences:**\n    Combining the two groups gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
