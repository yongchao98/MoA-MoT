    "An isolated system's total energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of interacting particles. The potential energy `U` between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `d` is given by `U = k * q1 * q2 / d`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge `q = 2e`. Let's label the particle at point P as `q_P` and the other 12 particles as `q_i` (for i=1 to 12).\n\nThe total energy `U_total` of the system can be split into two parts:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge `q_P` and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center_sphere`).\n2.  The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves (`U_sphere_sphere`).\n\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n\n**1. Center-Sphere Energy (`U_center_sphere`)**\nEach of the 12 particles `q_i` is at a fixed distance `r = 2 m` from the central charge `q_P`.\nThe potential energy for one such pair is `k * q_P * q_i / r = k * q^2 / r`.\nSince there are 12 such particles, the total energy for this part is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * k * q^2 / r`\nThis value is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n\n**2. Sphere-Sphere Energy (`U_sphere_sphere`)**\nTo find the minimum energy of the system, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere that minimizes their mutual repulsive potential energy. This is a classic problem in physics known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere.\n\nThe energy `U_sphere_sphere` is the sum of potential energies for all pairs of charges on the sphere. The number of pairs is `12 * 11 / 2 = 66`.\nIn an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r`, the vertices have specific distances between them:\n- Each vertex has 5 adjacent vertices. This gives `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` pairs at the shortest distance (the edge length of the icosahedron), `d1`.\n- Each vertex has 5 other vertices at a second distance, `d2`. This gives `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` pairs at distance `d2`.\n- Each vertex has 1 antipodal vertex. This gives `12 / 2 = 6` pairs at the largest distance, `d3 = 2r`.\n\nThe distances can be calculated from the geometry of the icosahedron relative to its circumradius `r`:\n- `d1 = r * sqrt(2 * (1 - 1/sqrt(5)))`\n- `d2 = r * sqrt(2 * (1 + 1/sqrt(5)))`\n- `d3 = 2r`\n\nThe total potential energy of this configuration is:\n`U_sphere_sphere = 30 * (k * q^2 / d1) + 30 * (k * q^2 / d2) + 6 * (k * q^2 / d3)`\n`U_sphere_sphere = (k * q^2 / r) * [30 / sqrt(2*(1 - 1/sqrt(5))) + 30 / sqrt(2*(1 + 1/sqrt(5))) + 6/2]`\nThe term in the brackets is a dimensionless constant representing the energy of the icosahedral shell, which evaluates to approximately 49.164.\nSo, `U_sphere_sphere ≈ 49.164 * k * q^2 / r`.\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / r) + (49.164 * k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_total = (12 + 49.164) * k * q^2 / r = 61.164 * k * q^2 / r`\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values to calculate the final energy.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define constants and parameters\nk = 8.98755e9  # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\ne = 1.6021766e-19  # Elementary charge in C\nr = 2.0  # Radius in meters\n\n# Charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# Calculate the dimensionless energy sum for the 12 particles on the sphere (icosahedron)\n# The sum is sum_{i<j} (r / d_ij)\n# There are 30 pairs at distance d1, 30 at d2, and 6 at d3=2r.\nd1_term = 30 / math.sqrt(2 * (1 - 1 / math.sqrt(5)))\nd2_term = 30 / math.sqrt(2 * (1 + 1 / math.sqrt(5)))\nd3_term = 6 / 2.0\nE_sphere_sphere_dimensionless = d1_term + d2_term + d3_term\n\n# The total dimensionless energy factor is the sum of the center-sphere interaction (12)\n# and the sphere-sphere interaction.\ntotal_dimensionless_factor = 12 + E_sphere_sphere_dimensionless\n\n# Calculate the total minimum energy\n# U_total = total_dimensionless_factor * (k * q^2 / r)\ntotal_energy = total_dimensionless_factor * (k * q**2 / r)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation, formatted to three decimal places\nprint(f\"{total_energy:.3e}\")\n# Print the result compared to option A\n# Option A is 2.822 x 10^-26\nprint(f\"Calculated value: {total_energy:.4f} x 10^-26\")\nprint(f\"Option A value:   2.822 x 10^-26\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical charges. 12 charges are on a sphere of radius `r = 2 m`, and one is at the center. The charge of each particle is `q = 2e`.\n\nThe total potential energy `U_total` of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  `U_center_sphere`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere_sphere`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n\n**1. Center-Sphere Energy (`U_center_sphere`)**\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a fixed distance `r = 2 m` from the central charge. The potential energy between the central charge and one charge on the sphere is `k * q^2 / r`. Since there are 12 such charges, this part of the energy is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / r)`\nThis energy is constant regardless of the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**2. Sphere-Sphere Energy (`U_sphere_sphere`)**\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we must find the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes their mutual repulsive potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this icosahedral shell of charges is given by `U_sphere_sphere = C * (k * q^2 / r)`, where `C` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for all pairs of vertices on a unit-radius icosahedron. The number of pairs is `12 * 11 / 2 = 66`. The value of `C` for an icosahedron is approximately 49.164.\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\nThe total minimum energy is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total_min = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere_min`\n`U_total_min = (12 * k * q^2 / r) + (49.164 * k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + 49.164) * (k * q^2 / r)`\n`U_total_min = 61.164 * (k * q^2 / r)`\n\n**Calculation**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   `k` (Coulomb's constant) ≈ `8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2 / C^2`\n*   `e` (elementary charge) ≈ `1.6021766 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `q = 2e` ≈ `3.2043532 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `r = 2.0 m`\n\n`q^2` ≈ `(3.2043532 x 10^-19)^2` ≈ `1.02678 x 10^-37 C^2`\n\n`k * q^2 / r` ≈ `(8.98755 x 10^9 * 1.02678 x 10^-37) / 2.0`\n`k * q^2 / r` ≈ `4.6141 x 10^-28 J`\n\n`U_total_min` ≈ `61.164 * (4.6141 x 10^-28 J)`\n`U_total_min` ≈ `2.822 x 10^-26 J`\n\nThis result matches the calculation performed by the Python code.\n\n<<<A>>>"
