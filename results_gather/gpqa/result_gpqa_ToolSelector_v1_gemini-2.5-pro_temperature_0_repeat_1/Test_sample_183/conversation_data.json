    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of multi-step organic synthesis, paying close attention to the directing effects of substituents on an aromatic ring and the specific reactions used to introduce or modify functional groups.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are crucial:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Groups**\n\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho/para director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Strong activator, ortho/para director. In strong acid, it becomes **-NH3+**, which is a strong deactivator and meta director. This is a key intermediate in many syntheses.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strong deactivator, meta director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's trace each proposed reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl`\n    This sequence is incorrect because it attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, NaNO2/HCl) before the necessary amine has been formed. The reduction of the nitro group to an amine (step viii, Fe/HCl) happens much later.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on aniline (the product of step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a strongly deactivated anilinium complex that will not undergo alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tBu ... ii) SO3H ... iii) NO2 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the regiochemistry:\n    i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene gives primarily **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (para product due to sterics).\n    iii) Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid: The -tBu group (at C4) and the -SO3H group (at C1) both direct nitration to position 3 (or 5). This gives **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    The resulting intermediate has the t-butyl and nitro groups meta to each other. The target molecule requires them to be ortho. Therefore, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product. Additionally, step (vi), nitrating a diazonium salt, is not a standard reaction.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence represents a plausible synthetic strategy, often used to control regiochemistry via an amino group. Let's trace the steps and regiochemistry:\n    i) **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation).\n    ii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. (Nitration). The bulky t-butyl group directs nitration predominantly to the para position. This is a high-yield step.\n    iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> 4-tert-butylaniline**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n    iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. (Nitration). In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The directing effects are:\n        *   -NH3+ (at C1) is a meta-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C4) is an ortho,para-director, directing to C3 and C5 (relative to its own position).\n        *   The two groups' directing effects reinforce each other, leading to nitration at position 3.\n    v) **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenyldiazonium salt**. (Diazotization).\n    vi) **Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol).\n    vii) **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Williamson Ether Synthesis).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe product from the logical execution of Option D is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule, but not the target molecule itself (`2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`).\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as none of the provided high-yield pathways logically lead to the specified target molecule. The ortho relationship between the bulky t-butyl group and the ethoxy group is very difficult to achieve through classical electrophilic substitution methods.\n\nHowever, among the given choices, Option D represents the most chemically sound and coherent sequence of standard synthetic reactions, despite leading to an isomeric product and having two extraneous steps (viii, ix) listed at the end. The other options contain fundamental errors in reaction compatibility or ordering (A, B) or rely on non-standard reactions and incorrect regiochemical pathways (C). Therefore, Option D is the \"best\" answer, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks for the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the options based on standard organic chemistry principles, particularly regiochemistry in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n1.  **Target Molecule Analysis**: The substituents are -OEt (1), -tBu (2), and -NO2 (3). The key relationships are that -OEt and -tBu are ortho, and -tBu and -NO2 are ortho. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: This sequence is incorrect because step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is placed before step (viii) `Fe/HCl` (reduction to an amine). Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not yet present.\n    *   **Option B**: This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) does not work on aniline (product of step ii) because the Lewis acid catalyst deactivates the ring by coordinating with the basic amino group.\n    *   **Option C**: This sequence uses a blocking group strategy. However, the nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (steps ii & iii) would yield 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, as both the -tBu and -SO3H groups direct to the 3-position. This intermediate does not have the required ortho relationship between the t-butyl group and the eventual nitro group. Furthermore, step (vi), nitration of a diazonium salt, is not a standard transformation.\n    *   **Option D**: This sequence follows a logical series of transformations common in multi-step synthesis.\n        i.  `tert-butylbenzene`\n        ii. `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene` (Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the para product in high yield).\n        iii. `4-tert-butylaniline` (Reduction of the nitro group).\n        iv. `3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline` (Nitration of the anilinium ion, where both the -NH3+ and -tBu groups direct the incoming nitro group to the 3-position).\n        v.  Diazotization of the amino group.\n        vi. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol (`3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol`).\n        vii. Williamson ether synthesis to form the ethoxy group (`4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`).\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The sequence in Option D is the most chemically sound pathway. Although it produces an isomer (`4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`) of the requested product, it is the only option that does not contain fundamental flaws in reaction order or type. The other options are definitively incorrect. It is highly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt, and that the synthesis described in Option D is the intended answer. The final two steps (viii and ix) in option D appear to be extraneous.\n\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
