    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nLet's break this down by looking at Maxwell's equations and what a magnetic monopole would imply.\n\nIn our universe, Maxwell's equations are:\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀ (The divergence of the electric field depends on electric charge density).\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ B = 0 (The divergence of the magnetic field is always zero). This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles.\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t (The circulation, or curl, of the electric field is caused by a changing magnetic field).\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t) (The circulation of the magnetic field is caused by electric currents and changing electric fields).\n\nNow, let's introduce magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles).\n\n1.  **Effect on Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This equation, ∇ ⋅ B = 0, explicitly says there are no magnetic monopoles. If they *did* exist, they would be sources of the magnetic field, just like electric charges are sources for the electric field. The equation would have to change to something like ∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So, the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.\n\n2.  **Effect on Faraday's Law:** If magnetic charges exist, they can also move, creating a \"magnetic current\" (J_m). In the standard equations, an electric current (J) creates a circulating magnetic field (∇ × B). By symmetry, a magnetic current would have to create a circulating electric field. This would add a new term to Faraday's Law, making it something like ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m. So, the equation for the **circulation of the electric field** must also change.\n\nThe other two equations would remain fundamentally the same. Therefore, the two equations that would be different are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
