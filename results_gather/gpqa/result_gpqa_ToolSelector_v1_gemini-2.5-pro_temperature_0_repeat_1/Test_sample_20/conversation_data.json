    "Answering this question requires applying fundamental principles of organic chemistry: tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Tautomerism (Compound A):**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of double bonds and have no hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, it lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and each has two hydrogen atoms. It can and does undergo tautomerism to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a highly stable aromatic compound.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Optical Isomerism (Compound B):**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is an alkene (trans isomer). It has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism (Compound A):** Tautomerism requires an alpha-hydrogen. Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens, so it cannot tautomerize. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol. Therefore, compound A, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism (Compound B):** Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents). In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3, making it a chiral center. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical, achiral molecule. Therefore, compound B, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine the findings:** A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This matches option D.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
