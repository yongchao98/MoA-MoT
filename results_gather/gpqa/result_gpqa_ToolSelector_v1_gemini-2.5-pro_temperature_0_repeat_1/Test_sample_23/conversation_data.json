    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is equivalent to 1/7.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(14n+2). For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n/14n = 1/7.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"), which is consistent with it being a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the value of 'n':**\n    *   Mixture Y is composed of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z (the cycloalkane, CnH2n).\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it D, must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z, because hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z.\n    *   For D to not decolorize bromine water and have the same carbon skeleton, it must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The most common cycloalkane/aromatic pair where the cycloalkane is a widely used solvent is cyclohexane/benzene. Let's assume this is our pair.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then n=6. This fits the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The other component D would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check: Hydrogenation of this mixture (Y) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only one final product, Z (cyclohexane). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6).\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides must be equal. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms (12 + 6).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane), both A and B must be C6 cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain double bonds). The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's set A = cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Checking the hydrogen sum: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
