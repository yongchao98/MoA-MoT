    "The problem requires us to find the value of the constant 'a' by normalizing the given wave function. The normalization condition in quantum mechanics states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible space must be 1.\n\n1.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position x is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`.\n    The wave function is `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i`.\n    This is a complex number with:\n    *   Real part: `Re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part: `Im(x) = -0.5`\n\n    The square of the magnitude is calculated as `|ψ(x)|² = (Re(x))² + (Im(x))²`.\n    `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n2.  **Normalization Integral:** The problem states that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this range must equal 1.\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1`\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\n3.  **Solve the Integral:**\n    *   First, find the antiderivative of the expression:\n        `∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x`\n    *   Now, evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n        `[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x]` (from x=1 to x=3)\n        `= (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)`\n        `= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)`\n        `= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c)`:\n        `= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5`\n        `= a² * ln(2) + 0.5`\n\n4.  **Solve for 'a':**\n    *   Set the result of the integral equal to 1:\n        `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   Using the value `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`:\n        `a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215`\n    *   `a ≈ sqrt(0.7215) ≈ 0.8494`\n\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.8494.
