    "<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n# The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n# T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n# where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis, and A is the albedo.\n\n# Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, T_star, R_star, and A are constant.\n# Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis:\n# T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n# P^2 ∝ a^3  =>  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n# Substituting the relation for 'a' into the proportionality for T_eq:\n# T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\n# T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n# So, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., planet 'i' and planet 'j') is:\n# T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (P_i / P_j)^(-1/3) = (P_j / P_i)^(1/3)\n\n# We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n# T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n# The given ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n# From this, we have the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\nP2_ratio_val = 2.0\nP4_ratio_val = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods P2 / P4\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio_val / P4_ratio_val\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). Since the energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance, the temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis:\n`T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`):\n`P^2 ∝ a^3`\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship for `a` into the proportionality for `T_eq`:\n`T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n`T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the relationship derived above:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\nFrom the given orbital period ratios (1:2:2.5:3.5:5), we can assign proportional values to the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P2 = 2`\n*   `P4 = 3.5`\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
