    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe question describes an immune response to an antigen (rotavirus protein) in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch). The key observation is \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA) VDJ recombination is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. This occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The process described in the question is happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\nB) Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers (which are present in Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process, followed by selection for B cells with higher affinity receptors, is responsible for affinity maturation and directly results in the observed \"high variability\" within the variable region of an antigen-specific B cell population.\n\nC) Class switching recombination changes the constant region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). It does not affect the variable region, so it cannot explain the variability observed there.\n\nD) Complement activation is a component of the innate and adaptive immune response that helps clear pathogens but does not involve any genetic modification of B cell genes.\n\nThe scenario describes the events of a germinal center reaction, where proliferating B cells undergo somatic hypermutation to increase their antibody affinity. This directly causes high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
