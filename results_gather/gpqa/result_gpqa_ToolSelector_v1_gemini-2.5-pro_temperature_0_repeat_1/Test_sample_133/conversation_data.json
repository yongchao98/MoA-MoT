    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total heat released from the neutralization reaction between the acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The heat released is determined by the number of moles of water formed, which depends on the limiting reactant (either H⁺ or OH⁻ ions).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids.**\n\n*   **From HCl (a strong monoprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **From H₂SO₄ (a strong diprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ provides 2 H⁺ ions per molecule:\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol (from HCl) + 0.18 mol (from H₂SO₄) = 0.28 mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of OH⁻ ions from the base.**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\n**Step 3: Identify the limiting reactant and moles of water formed.**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.20 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ (0.20) are less than the moles of H⁺ (0.28), OH⁻ is the limiting reactant.\n*   The number of moles of water formed is equal to the moles of the limiting reactant, which is 0.20 mol.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.6 kcal/mol (or -57.1 kJ/mol).\n*   Total Enthalpy (ΔH) = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of neutralization per mole\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\nNote: A precipitation reaction between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ also occurs, forming BaSO₄. However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" and the calculated value of -2.72 kcal perfectly matches one of the options, indicating that the heat from precipitation should be disregarded for this question.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
