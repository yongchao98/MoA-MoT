    "The problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which we can approximate as being at rest, along with the proton. Therefore, the initial energy is purely the rest mass energy of the two particles. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), all with the same mass $m_A$. Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four product particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Solve for Velocity:**\n    First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n\n    Next, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\n    Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
