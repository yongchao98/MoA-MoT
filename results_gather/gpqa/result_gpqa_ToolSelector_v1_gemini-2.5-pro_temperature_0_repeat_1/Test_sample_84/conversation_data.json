The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star induced by a planet in a\n#    circular orbit is given by K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a)), where M_p is\n#    the planet's mass and M_star is the star's mass.\n#    From this, we can see the relationship: K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a).\n\n# 3. Rearranging for sqrt(a), we get: sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K.\n#    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n#    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n# 4.

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq)**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula shows that for a given star and albedo (A), the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'):\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 is:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √a₂ / √a₁\n\n**2. Radial Velocity (RV) and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet, which is a measure of the star's radial velocity (K). For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital distance (a):\n\nK ∝ M_p / √a\n\n(This assumes the planets are viewed nearly edge-on, which is a valid assumption since they were detected by the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for √a:\n\n√a ∝ M_p / K\n\n**3. Connecting Temperature and RV**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for √a into our temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √a₂ / √a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂) / (M_p1 / K₁)\n\nRearranging this gives:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n**4. Using the Doppler Shift Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). This means the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nSubstituting this into our equation from Step 3 gives the final formula:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)**\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
