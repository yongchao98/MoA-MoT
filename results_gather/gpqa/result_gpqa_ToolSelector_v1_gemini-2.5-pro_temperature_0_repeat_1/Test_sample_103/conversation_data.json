    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity. Therefore, the amplitude of the periodic velocity variation, known as the RV semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5.\n\n2.  **The RV Semi-Amplitude Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of the host star is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that:\n    *   The star masses are the same (M_star₁ = M_star₂).\n    *   The planet masses are the same (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂).\n    *   To solve the problem, we must make the standard simplifying assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)).\n\n    With these conditions, all terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems except for the period, P. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We need to solve for P₂ / P₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    *   P₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe solution can be found by relating the observed wavelength shift to the orbital period of the exoplanet.\n\n1.  The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is K₂/K₁ = Δλ₂/Δλ₁ = 7/5.\n\n2.  The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the conservation of momentum. For a planet in a circular orbit, it is:\n    K ∝ (mₚ / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3))\n    where mₚ is the planet mass, M_star is the star mass, and P is the orbital period.\n\n3.  In this problem, we are given that the star masses are equal (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are equal (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂). This simplifies the relationship to:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  We can now write the ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n5.  We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁. We can rearrange the equation and substitute the known values:\n    P₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)^3\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
