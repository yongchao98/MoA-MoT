    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe unknown compound can be identified by systematically analyzing the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons and is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent non-equivalent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O). All four options are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the alkene (vinyl) region, indicating the presence of a -CH=CH- group.\n\n3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for one vinyl proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For protons across a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) is indicative of a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz). This strongly suggests the compound is either Trans-propenyl acetate or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinyl proton. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet arises from coupling to a neighboring group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is for a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the methyl group that is coupled to the vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n- We have an acetate group (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n- We have a *trans* double bond (from the J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant).\n- The double bond is part of a CH₃-CH=CH- fragment (from the dq splitting at 5.5 ppm and the d splitting at 1.6 ppm).\n\nThe structure is therefore **Trans-propenyl acetate**: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃.\n\nLet's check the proton count. The structure has 3 (acetyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 8 protons. The NMR data integration is 3H + 1H + 1H + 3H = 8H. This matches. A butenyl acetate would have 10 protons, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n<<<A>>>",
