    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride with a single 1H NMR peak (7 ppm) and two 13C NMR peaks (137, 165 ppm) is **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data perfectly matches its symmetric structure.\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   The reaction between a diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The question states a major and a minor product are formed. This corresponds to the *exo* and *endo* isomers.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap. However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance.\n    *   In this case, the diene is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride ring would be tucked \"under\" the diene, leading to significant steric clash with the methyl groups. In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride ring points away, minimizing this clash.\n    *   Therefore, due to sterics, the **exo product is the major product**, and the *endo* product is the minor one.\n\n3.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product (*exo*)** but **absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Examine the 3D Structures:**\n    *   Let's draw the product structure (1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride) and identify the key proton groups.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Alkene Methyls (Me_alkene):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bridgehead):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** Two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C=C double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons close to the **Me_alkene** groups. A NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C=C double bond, tucked under the molecule. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** groups. A NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The NOE that is present in the major (*exo*) and absent in the minor (*endo*) is between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n    *   Now we assign the signals from the options to these groups:\n        *   The two equivalent anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is a reasonable chemical shift for this group. (The other 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm would correspond to the more shielded bridgehead methyls).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe reaction described is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This reaction produces two stereoisomers: an *exo* and an *endo* product.\n\nTypically, the *endo* product is the major kinetic product. However, the diene in this reaction is highly substituted with four methyl groups, which creates significant steric hindrance. This steric clash destabilizes the *endo* transition state, making the *exo* isomer the major product and the *endo* isomer the minor product.\n\nA NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space. The question states that a cross-peak is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*). We must therefore identify a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* structure but far apart in the *endo* structure.\n\nLet's analyze the structures:\n1.  **Proton Groups:** The product contains several distinct proton groups: the two protons on the anhydride ring (H_anhydride), the six protons of the two methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene), the six protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead), and the two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n2.  **Signal Assignment:** Based on typical chemical shifts:\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent anhydride protons (H_anhydride).\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups.\n3.  **Spatial Proximity:**\n    *   In the **major (*exo*) isomer**, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the double bond. This places the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) in close proximity to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). An NOE cross-peak is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (*endo*) isomer**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked away from the double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl groups, so no significant NOE is expected.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
