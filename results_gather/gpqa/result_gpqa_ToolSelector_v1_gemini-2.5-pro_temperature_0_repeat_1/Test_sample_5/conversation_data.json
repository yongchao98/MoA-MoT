    "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy eigenvalues for a particle in the given potential. The most straightforward approach is to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and see if it simplifies into a recognizable form.\n\n1.  **Convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates.**\n    We use the standard transformations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n\n    The potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ).\n    Let's substitute the Cartesian equivalents. Notice that r²cos²(θ) = (r cos(θ))² = x².\n    So, the potential becomes:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\n2.  **Simplify the potential.**\n    Combine the terms with x² and y²:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n3.  **Recognize the form of the potential.**\n    The potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    *   V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    *   where V_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\n    *   and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\n4.  **Find the energy spectrum.**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y oscillators, E = E_x + E_y.\n    The energy for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 k'q² is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m).\n        The energy is E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m).\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The spring constant is k_y = k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).\n        The energy is E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy.**\n    Sum the energies for the x and y directions:\n    E = E_nx + E_ny\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo find the energy spectrum, we first convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe potential is given by:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nUsing the relations x = r cos(θ) and r² = x² + y², we can rewrite the potential as:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is separable and represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It can be written as the sum of two independent 1D harmonic oscillator potentials:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x² and V_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y².\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential 1/2 k'q² are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\nFor the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k, so the angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m). The energy is:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k, so the angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k/m). The energy is:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
