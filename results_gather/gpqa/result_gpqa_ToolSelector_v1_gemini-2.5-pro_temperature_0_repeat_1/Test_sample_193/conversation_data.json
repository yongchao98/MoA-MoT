    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z, which is defined as the sum over all possible states of the system of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE).\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can be either +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nLet's enumerate all 8 possible states, calculate the energy for each, and then sum their Boltzmann factors.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\nThis can happen in two ways:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    Energy E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    Energy E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nSo, there are **2 states** with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis can happen in the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 ways:\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    Energy E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    Energy E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    Energy E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    Energy E₆ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    Energy E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    Energy E₈ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nSo, there are **6 states** with energy **E = J**.\n\n**Calculating the Partition Function (Z):**\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, taking into account the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\nZ = (degeneracy of E=-3J) * e^(-β * (-3J)) + (degeneracy of E=J) * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo find the partition function Z, we must sum the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE) over all possible states of the system. The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), each taking values +1 or -1, leading to 2³ = 8 total states. The energy is E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nWe can group the states by their energy levels:\n\n1.  **States where all spins are aligned:**\n    *   Configuration (+1, +1, +1): E = -J(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = -3J.\n    *   Configuration (-1, -1, -1): E = -J((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -3J.\n    *   There are **2 states** with energy **-3J**.\n\n2.  **States where one spin is different from the other two:**\n    *   Consider the configuration (+1, +1, -1): E = -J(1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J.\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two will have the same energy. These states are: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), and (-1,-1,+1).\n    *   There are **6 states** with energy **J**.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy (g):\nZ = Σ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = (2 * e^(-β * -3J)) + (6 * e^(-β * J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
