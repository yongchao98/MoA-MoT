    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step deduction of the molecule's structure from the provided spectroscopic data, followed by a calculation of its chemical formula. This is a reasoning-based task.\n\n**1. Analyze the Aromatic Ring:**\n*   The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it's a benzene ring with two substituents, having a base formula of C6H4.\n*   The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern is characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution, where symmetry results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons. This accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substituents using FTIR and NMR:**\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for **C** and **O2**.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The NMR shows two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n    *   The proton on the first carbon (-CH=) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton, giving a doublet.\n    *   The proton on the second carbon (=CH-) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   This fragment accounts for **C3H5**.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups.\n    *   One -CH3 signal is from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must be part of the ester group. Since the problem states there are no -CH2- signals, an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is ruled out. Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (-COO**CH3**). This accounts for the ester's carbon and the remaining **CH3** group.\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\nLet's combine the identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   One substituent is the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 (C3H5)\n*   The other substituent is the methyl ester group: -COOCH3 (C2H3O2)\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from -**C**OOCH3) + 1 (from -COO**C**H3) + 3 (from -**C**H=**C**H-**C**H3) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from -COOC**H3**) + 5 (from -**H**C=C**H**-C**H3**) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from -C**O****O**CH3) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nComparing our calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo determine the chemical formula, we must deduce the structure of the compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring (C6H4):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment.\n\n2.  **Ester Group (-COOCH3):** The FTIR indicates an ester group (-COO-). The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals and no -CH2- signals. One of these -CH3 signals must belong to the ester, making it a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This fragment accounts for C2H3O2.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group (-CH=CH-CH3):** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl protons (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment also accounts for the second -CH3 signal seen in the spectrum. This fragment's formula is C3H5.\n\n4.  **Total Formula Calculation:** We assemble the fragments: a C6H4 ring substituted with a -COOCH3 group and a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (ester methyl) + 3 (propenyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 (ring) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (ester) = 2\n\nThe final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option C.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
