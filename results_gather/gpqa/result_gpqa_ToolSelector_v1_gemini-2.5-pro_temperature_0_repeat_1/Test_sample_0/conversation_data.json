    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This uncertainty, ΔE, represents the natural \"width\" or \"blurriness\" of the energy level.\n\nTo clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the energy width of each level. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this larger width is the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width for State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy width for State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    The larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two states, as it is the only value greater than the energy width of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
