    "This problem requires a detailed analysis of the proton NMR (¹H NMR) splitting patterns for each of the candidate molecules. Let's break down the information provided and analyze each structure.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR:**\n    *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   No vinyl-hydrogens: This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This complex splitting pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet, n=1, n+1=2)\n        *   Two neighboring protons (causes the **t**riplet, n=2, n+1=3)\n        *   Three neighboring protons (causes the **q**uartet, n=3, n+1=4)\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet, n=1, n+1=2)\n        *   Two neighboring protons (causes one **t**riplet, n=2, n+1=3)\n        *   Another group of two neighboring protons (causes the second **t**riplet, n=2, n+1=3)\n\nOur task is to find the molecule that has protons matching both of these descriptions.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the methine (C-H) protons in each structure, as they are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n*   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> `(CH3)2CH(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **H3:** Coupled to H4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   **H4:** Coupled to H3 (1H) and two CH₃ groups (6H). This would produce a doublet of septets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> `CH3CH2(5,4)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(2)(C2H5)-COOH(1)` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **H3:** Coupled to H2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   **H2:** Coupled to H3 (1H) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This would produce a doublet of triplets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal (no proton is coupled to a total of 6 neighbors).\n\n*   **D) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> `CH3CH2(5,4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH(1)` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **H3:** Coupled to H2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   **H2:** Coupled to H3 (1H) and its own CH₃ group (3H). This would produce a doublet of quartets.\n    *   This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> `CH3(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **H3:** Coupled to H4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would give a **dtt** signal.\n    *   **H4:** Coupled to H3 (1H), the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H), and the CH₃ at C5 (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would give a **dtq** signal (or more precisely, a doublet of triplets of quartets, with the order depending on the coupling constants).\n    *   This molecule has one proton that produces a `dtt` signal and another that produces a `dtq` signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMolecule B is the only candidate that possesses both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which is consistent with all four options. The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons: one group of 1 proton (giving the doublet), one group of 2 protons (giving the triplet), and one group of 3 protons (giving the quartet).\n2.  **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a different proton that is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons: one group of 1 proton (giving the doublet), and two different groups of 2 protons (each giving a triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the structure of option B: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid. Let's number the carbons starting from the carboxyl group:\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n*   **The proton on C3 (H3):** It is coupled to:\n    *   The proton on C4 (1H) -> doublet\n    *   The two protons on C2 (2H) -> triplet\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2H) -> triplet\n    This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals described.\n\n*   **The proton on C4 (H4):** It is coupled to:\n    *   The proton on C3 (1H) -> doublet\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H) -> triplet\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H) -> quartet\n    This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other signal described.\n\nSince molecule B is the only option that contains protons exhibiting both of the specified splitting patterns, it is the correct structure.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
