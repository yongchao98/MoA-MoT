    "This is a classic relativistic physics problem that can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺) moving towards each other.\n    *   Electron Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4.\n    *   Positron Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2.\n    *   Let the rest mass of both be `m_e`.\n*   **Final State:** Two photons (γ) with equal energy.\n    *   Energy of each photon, E_γ.\n    *   The photons move at angles +θ and -θ with respect to the initial axis of motion.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after.\n*   The relativistic energy of a particle is E = γmc².\n*   Initial Energy (E_initial) = E_electron + E_positron = γ_e*m_e*c² + γ_p*m_e*c² = (4 + 2)m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c².\n*   Final Energy (E_final) = E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2*E_γ.\n*   Equating them: 2*E_γ = 6*m_e*c²  =>  **E_γ = 3*m_e*c²**.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nMomentum must also be conserved. We only need to consider the component along the horizontal axis (let's call it the x-axis).\n*   The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = √(E² - (mc²)²) / c = m_e*c*√(γ² - 1).\n*   Initial Momentum (p_initial):\n    *   p_electron = m_e*c*√(4² - 1) = m_e*c*√15 (moving right, so positive).\n    *   p_positron = -m_e*c*√(2² - 1) = -m_e*c*√3 (moving left, so negative).\n    *   p_initial_total = m_e*c*(√15 - √3).\n*   Final Momentum (p_final):\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    *   p_γ = (3*m_e*c²) / c = 3*m_e*c.\n    *   The x-component of momentum for the two photons is p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(-θ) = 2*p_γ*cos(θ).\n    *   p_final_total = 2 * (3*m_e*c) * cos(θ) = 6*m_e*c*cos(θ).\n*   Equating them: m_e*c*(√15 - √3) = 6*m_e*c*cos(θ).\n*   Simplifying gives: cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow we need to calculate the value of θ and then the total angle between the photons, which is 2θ. This requires a calculation that is best done with a script.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the conservation of momentum, we derived:\n# cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"The angle between the photons is: {total_angle:.2f} degrees\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum yielded an angle of approximately 138.19 degrees. This value is closest to option B.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Initial Energy = E_electron + E_positron\n    *   E_initial = γ_e*m_e*c² + γ_p*m_e*c² = (4 + 2)m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c²\n    *   Final Energy = E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2*E_γ (since energies are equal)\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: 2*E_γ = 6*m_e*c²  =>  E_γ = 3*m_e*c²\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum (x-axis):**\n    *   Initial Momentum = p_electron + p_positron\n    *   p_particle = γ*m*v = √(γ² - 1) * m*c\n    *   p_initial = [√(4² - 1) * m_e*c] - [√(2² - 1) * m_e*c] = (√15 - √3) * m_e*c\n    *   Final Momentum = p_photon1_x + p_photon2_x\n    *   p_photon = E_γ / c = 3*m_e*c\n    *   The photons move at angles θ and -θ to the x-axis.\n    *   p_final = p_photon*cos(θ) + p_photon*cos(-θ) = 2*p_photon*cos(θ) = 2 * (3*m_e*c) * cos(θ) = 6*m_e*c*cos(θ)\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum: (√15 - √3) * m_e*c = 6*m_e*c*cos(θ)\n\n3.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n    *   The total angle between the photons is 2θ.\n    *   Total Angle = 2 * 69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees.\n\nThis matches the code output and corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
