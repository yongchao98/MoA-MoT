    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a given star and a planet's albedo (A), the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital semi-major axis (a):\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period and Orbital Distance:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:**\n    We need to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n    From the temperature relation in step 1, we can express 'a' in terms of T_eq:\n    √a ∝ 1 / T_eq  =>  a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    Now, substitute this expression for 'a' into the period relation from step 2:\n    P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n    This crucial relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratios:**\n    We want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1.\n    Using the relationship from step 3:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    We can find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now substitute this temperature ratio back into the period ratio equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n    P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for this calculation, as the albedo is the same for all planets and thus cancels out in the ratios.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 3.2\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated factor matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
