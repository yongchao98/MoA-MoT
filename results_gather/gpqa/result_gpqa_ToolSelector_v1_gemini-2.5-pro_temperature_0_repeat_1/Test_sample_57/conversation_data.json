    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nLet's analyze the options in the context of high-energy physics and the need for regularization.\n\nRegularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with infinities, specifically ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which arise from calculations involving loops of virtual particles at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances).\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** are both quantum field theories that form parts of the Standard Model. They are well-known to suffer from UV divergences in their calculations. These infinities are handled through the process of regularization followed by renormalization. Therefore, both QCD and QED require regularization.\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics** is a classical theory. While it has its own infinity problem (the self-energy of a point charge is infinite), the term \"regularization at high energies\" typically refers to the taming of loop divergences in a quantum context. Classical theory does not have these quantum loops. However, the theory is known to be incomplete and breaks down at high energies, where it is replaced by QED (which does require regularization).\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory** is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be UV-finite. By replacing point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, the theory \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances. This is conjectured to eliminate the ultraviolet divergences that plague conventional quantum field theories. As a result, superstring theory is not expected to require regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only theory listed that is believed to be free from high-energy divergences and thus would not require regularization.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
