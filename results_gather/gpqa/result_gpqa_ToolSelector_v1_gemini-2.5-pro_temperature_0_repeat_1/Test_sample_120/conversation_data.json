    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Apply the Regioselectivity Rule:**\n    *   The problem states that the alkyl group (methyl) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Stereoselectivity Rule:**\n    *   The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added.\n    *   The attack is at C6, which has an initial configuration of **S** (from the starting material name).\n    *   Due to inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **R**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Fate of Other Stereocenters:**\n    *   The configurations of the carbons not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming at the reaction center (C3 and C4) remain unchanged. So, C3 remains **R** and C4 remains **R**.\n    *   At C1, the C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and after workup, an -OH group is formed. The stereochemistry at the C1 carbon atom itself is retained. So, C1 remains **R**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a substituted cyclohexanol. The -OH group is at the position of the original C1.\n    *   The product has four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, plus the new one added at C6.\n    *   For IUPAC naming, the ring must be re-numbered. The carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents (the four methyl groups), we compare numbering clockwise vs. counter-clockwise from the new C1.\n        *   The methyl groups are on the original C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n        *   Let New C1 = Old C1.\n        *   Numbering counter-clockwise: New C2 = Old C6. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). Locant set: {1,2,4,5}.\n        *   Numbering clockwise: New C2 = Old C2. The methyl groups are at positions 1, 3 (from old C3), 4 (from old C4), and 6 (from old C6). Locant set: {1,3,4,6}.\n    *   The set {1,2,4,5} is lower. Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n6.  **Assign Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   We map the configurations to the new numbering system:\n        *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Retains its configuration -> **R**.\n        *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Undergoes inversion (S → R) -> **R**.\n        *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Retains its configuration -> **R**.\n        *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Retains its configuration -> **R**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
