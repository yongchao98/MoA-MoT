    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving alkylation and cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOEt]-.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** The \"excess\" NaH removes the remaining acidic alpha-proton. The resulting carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we need to analyze the symmetry of Product 4. For substituted cyclohexanes, we typically assume rapid chair-chair interconversion at room temperature unless stated otherwise. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to rapid chair flipping, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4.\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH2**-) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-**CH3**) are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C6 equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons are chemically equivalent in the time-averaged structure. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C5 equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons are also chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   C4 lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. Its two protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Adding them up: 2 (from the ethyl group) + 3 (from the cyclohexane ring) = **5 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThe other options correspond to less likely scenarios:\n*   12 signals would arise if the ring were \"locked\" in a single asymmetric chair conformation (and assuming the two -OCH2- protons are equivalent).\n*   8 signals is difficult to justify with a plausible conformation.\n\nBased on the standard model for analyzing cyclohexane NMR at room temperature, the correct answer is 5.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe reaction sequence produces 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane as the final product (4). To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum, we analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):** This group has two sets of chemically distinct protons: the methylene (-CH2-) protons and the methyl (-CH3) protons. This accounts for **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** At room temperature, cyclohexane and its simple derivatives undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry in product 4, which passes through the substituted carbon (C1) and the carbon directly opposite it (C4).\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The protons on C4 are unique but are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n    This accounts for **3 signals** from the ring protons.\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring gives a total of 2 + 3 = 5 distinct hydrogen signals.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
