    "This problem requires calculations based on the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame, we first need to determine how much time has passed in that frame. This involves calculating the Lorentz factor and applying the time dilation formula. These are non-trivial computations, making the CODE action the most suitable choice.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Define the constants: the relative velocity `v`, the proper time `Δt₀` (time in the ejecta's frame), and the speed of light `c`.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n3.  Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n4.

    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The ejecta's frame is the \"moving\" frame. The time measured in this frame is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The Galaxy's frame is the \"stationary\" frame. We need to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for the event than the observer in the moving frame (the ejecta). This is called time dilation. The relationship is given by:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where:\n    *   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy).\n    *   `Δt₀` is the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta), which is 50 s.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the relative velocity = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n    First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):** Now we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:** The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe code output provided a precise calculation of `3,061,862.178... km`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer, `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
