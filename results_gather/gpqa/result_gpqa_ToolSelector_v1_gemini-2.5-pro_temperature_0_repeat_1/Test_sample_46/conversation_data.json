    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe provided data can be used to deduce the structure of the compound C9H11NO2 step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is supported by the IR data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two sets. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   The fragments identified are: a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this against the options:\n        *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This would have a propionyl group, and the NMR signal for the -CH2- next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two doublets. Also, an amide carbonyl typically appears at a lower frequency in the IR spectrum.\n        *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n        *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and only one N-H proton in the NMR.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
