    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere's a breakdown of the symmetries in the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT):\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental assumption in the construction of any relativistic quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective extensions. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, encompassing both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle upon which SMEFT is built. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This symmetry is already known to be violated in the Standard Model itself (e.g., in the weak interactions described by the CKM matrix). SMEFT is an extension of the SM and can introduce new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
