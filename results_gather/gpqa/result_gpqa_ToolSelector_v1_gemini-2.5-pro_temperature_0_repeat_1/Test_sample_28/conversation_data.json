    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. This typically involves identifying the mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the gene's coding sequence.\n\nThe process of protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` start codon and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, except for stop codons which terminate protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the beginning of the intact gene and each mutant by breaking them into codons:\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, `TTT` changes to `TTC` (both code for Phenylalanine, a silent mutation) and `CTC` changes to `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine, a missense mutation). A single amino acid change might not be enough to inactivate the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This is highly likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine). These are two missense mutations. While this changes two amino acids, it is less disruptive than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `GGT` (Glycine) is deleted. This is a missense mutation combined with an in-frame deletion of one amino acid. While this could affect the protein, the reading frame is maintained, and it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to the nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will lead to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>",
