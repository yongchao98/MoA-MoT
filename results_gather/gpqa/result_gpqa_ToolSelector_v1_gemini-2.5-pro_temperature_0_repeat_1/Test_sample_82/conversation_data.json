    "This is a multi-step titration problem that requires several calculations: dilution, moles calculation, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer region, and hydrolysis calculation for the equivalence point. While the steps are standard for a chemistry problem, performing them manually is prone to error. Using a code block will ensure accuracy for each step of the calculation.\n\n1.  **Dilution:** First, calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after being diluted with water.\n2.  **25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, so the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3.\n3.  **Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base. We need to calculate the concentration of the acetate, find Kb from Ka, and then calculate the [OH⁻] to find the pOH, and finally the pH.\n\nThese calculations, especially the hydrolysis part, are best handled by code to avoid manual errors.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# 1.
