    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We are given how the number of stars changes with parallax (`plx`) and we need to find out how it changes with distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:** The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is that they are inversely proportional.\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n\n3.  **State the Given Information:** The number of stars per unit parallax interval, let's call it `N(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    where `dN` is the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables:** We want to find the number of stars per unit distance interval, `dN/dr`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    *   `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    We use the absolute value because the number of stars in an interval must be positive.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We need to find `d(plx)/dr`.\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate with respect to `r`:\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   The absolute value is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now substitute everything back into the chain rule equation:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   Now, replace `plx` with `1/r`:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes as `r³`. This corresponds to option B.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
