    "This is a multi-step physics problem that requires calculation.\n\n1.  **Calculate the brightness drop from the starspots.** The brightness (or more accurately, the flux) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴). When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction of its surface is cooler.\n    *   Star Temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Spot Temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor (f) = 0.20\n    *   The relative drop in brightness (ΔF/F) due to spots is given by: ΔF/F_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n2.  **Calculate the brightness drop from a transiting exoplanet.** When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its area to the star's area.\n    *   Star Radius = R_star\n    *   Planet Radius = R_pl\n    *   The relative drop in brightness (ΔF/F) due to a transit is: ΔF/F_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate the two effects and solve for the planet/star radius ratio (R_pl / R_star).**\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    *   R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\nThe calculation requires plugging in the given values.
