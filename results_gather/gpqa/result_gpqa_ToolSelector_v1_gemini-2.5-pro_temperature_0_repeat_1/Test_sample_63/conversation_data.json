    "This is a multi-step quantitative chemistry problem. I need to identify two unknown salts, A and B, based on the products of their thermal decomposition. The process involves calculating the moles of each product, determining the elemental composition of the original mixture, deducing the chemical formulas of the salts, and finally counting the atoms in their formulas. This requires a series of calculations (mole conversions, mass balances) which are best handled by code to ensure accuracy and clarity of the logical steps.\n\n1.  **Analyze the decomposition products:** The gas mixture is passed through three tubes.\n    *   Tube 1 absorbs H₂O. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Tube 2 absorbs acidic gases. No weight change means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NOₓ) were formed.\n    *   Tube 3 absorbs O₂. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen produced.\n    *   The remaining gas (2.24 L at STP) is inert under these conditions, which strongly suggests it is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine elemental composition:** From the moles of H₂O, O₂, and N₂, I can calculate the moles of H, O, and N atoms in the original 7.20 g mixture. This should account for the total mass.\n\n3.  **Identify the salts:** The salts are composed of N, H, and O. Given they are an equimolar mixture and decompose into N₂, O₂, and H₂O, they are likely ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). I can verify this hypothesis by checking if the mole ratios of the products match the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** Once the salts are identified, I will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and sum them up.\n\nThis entire process is a chain of calculations, making the `CODE` action the most suitable choice.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define constants and initial data ---\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H = 1.008\nM_N = 14.007\nM_O = 16.00\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nM_O2 = 2 * M_O\nM_N2 = 2 * M_N\n\n# Molar volume at STP (L/mol)\nV_STP = 22.4\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80  # g, mass of O2\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L, volume of N2\n\nprint(\"--- Step 2: Calculate moles of decomposition products ---\")\n# Moles of water absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O produced: {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\n\n# Moles of oxygen absorbed by hot copper\nmoles_O2 = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O2\nprint(f\"Moles of O2 produced: {moles_O2:.4f} mol\")\n\n# Moles of remaining gas C (assumed to be N2)\nmoles_N2 = volume_gas_C / V_STP\nprint(f\"Moles of N2 produced: {moles_N2:.4f} mol\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 3: Determine elemental composition of the original mixture ---\")\n# Moles of each element\nmoles_H_total = moles_H2O * 2\nmoles_N_total = moles_N2 * 2\nmoles_O_total = moles_H2O * 1 + moles_O2 * 2\n\nprint(f\"Total moles of H: {moles_H_total:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total moles of N: {moles_N_total:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total moles of O: {moles_O_total:.4f} mol\")\n\n# Verify total mass\ncalculated_mass = moles_H_total * M_H + moles_N_total * M_N + moles_O_total * M_O\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated total mass from elements: {calculated_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mixture mass: {mass_mixture:.2f} g\")\n# The masses match, confirming the elemental composition is correct.\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 4: Identify the salts A and B ---\")\n# Hypothesis: The salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n# Decomposition reactions:\n# A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n# B: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O  (or NH4NO3 -> N2 + 0.5 O2 + 2H2O)\n\n# Let 'n' be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n# Total moles of products expected from 'n' moles of each salt:\n# Expected N2 = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n# Expected H2O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n# Expected O2 = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = 0.5n\n\n# We can solve for 'n' using our calculated moles of products.\nn_from_H2O = moles_H2O / 4\nn_from_O2 = moles_O2 / 0.5\nn_from_N2 = moles_N2 / 2\n\nprint(f\"Value of 'n' calculated from H2O: {n_from_H2O:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Value of 'n' calculated from O2: {n_from_O2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Value of 'n' calculated from N2: {n_from_N2:.4f}\")\n# The values for 'n' are consistent, confirming the hypothesis.\nn = n_from_O2 # Use one of the calculated values\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe mixture contains {n:.3f} moles of NH4NO2 and {n:.3f} moles of NH4NO3.\")\n\n# Final check with molar masses\nM_NH4NO2 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 2 * M_O\nM_NH4NO3 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 3 * M_O\nmass_check = n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3\nprint(f\"\\nMass check: {n:.3f} mol * ({M_NH4NO2:.2f} g/mol + {M_NH4NO3:.2f} g/mol) = {mass_check:.2f} g\")\n# This matches the initial 7.20 g.\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms ---\")\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N(2) H(4) O(2)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\nprint(f\"Atoms in one formula unit of NH4NO2: {atoms_A}\")\n\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N(2) H(4) O(3)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\nprint(f\"Atoms in one formula unit of NH4NO3: {atoms_B}\")\n\n# Total number of atoms in the two salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = {atoms_A} + {atoms_B} = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is solved by identifying the products of the thermal decomposition and using them to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n1.  **Identify the Decomposition Products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) shows no weight change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) absorbs oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition:**\n    *   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol\n        *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol\n    *   The presence of only N, H, and O suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   The salts are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume the mixture contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The likely candidates that decompose to N₂, H₂O, and O₂ are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with their decomposition reactions:\n        *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or simplified: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n    *   From 'n' moles of each salt, the total moles of products would be:\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = 0.5n\n    *   Using the moles of products calculated in step 1:\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n    => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   The consistent value of n = 0.05 mol confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n4.  **Count the Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₂. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₃. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
