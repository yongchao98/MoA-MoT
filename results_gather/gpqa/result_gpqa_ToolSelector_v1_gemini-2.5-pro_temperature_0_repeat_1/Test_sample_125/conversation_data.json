    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one existing chiral center at carbon 5, with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon 3 is reduced to an alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Products:** The hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, leading to the formation of two products with (R) or (S) configuration at the new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two chiral centers, but only one has changed configuration. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) are reduced to alcohols by excess NaBH4, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 5: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product 5 has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   In total, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC (achiral column).**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different properties, and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in the chiral HPLC.**\n*   A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)). The meso compound will also be separated from them. This gives **3 peaks** (one for each enantiomer and one for the meso compound).\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined product mixture will show **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
