    "*   **Analyze the observations:**\n    1.  **NMR:** Two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (summing to 1H). This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical environments for that proton, in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The two species are isomers of some kind.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** Two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace with equal intensities. This means there are two compounds that can be separated by chromatography. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This confirms the two species are isomers of the target molecule.\n    3.  **Context:** The molecule is a peptide. Peptides contain chiral centers and amide bonds. Rotation around the C-N amide bond is restricted, which can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (rotamers).\n\n*   **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties, meaning they will have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). They have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the observations. The two species could be rotamers (cis/trans isomers around an amide bond) or epimers (differing at one of several chiral centers), both of which are types of diastereomers.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a side product with a different chemical formula and a higher mass than the expected molecule. The MS data contradicts this, as both observed peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different mass. The MS data contradicts this.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (standard NMR solvent, standard LC column), they have identical physical and chemical properties. They would not produce two different peaks in the NMR spectrum, nor would they separate into two peaks on a standard LC column. This explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers. These two species have the same mass but are chemically and physically distinct enough to be resolved by both NMR and LC.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe observations point to the presence of two distinct chemical species that are isomers of each other.\n\n1.  **LC-MS Data:** The presence of two peaks in the LC with the same mass spectrum indicates two isomers that are separable by chromatography. This rules out contaminants or side products with different molecular weights (ruling out B and C).\n2.  **NMR Data:** The two peaks for a single proton indicate that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. This means the two isomers are structurally distinct in a way that affects the local magnetic field.\n3.  **Comparing Isomer Types:**\n    *   **Enantiomers (D)** are indistinguishable by standard NMR and LC, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. This contradicts the observation of two separate peaks in both techniques.\n    *   **Diastereomers (A)** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and are therefore distinguishable by both NMR (different chemical shifts) and standard LC (different retention times). This perfectly matches all the observations. In peptides, this phenomenon is often caused by restricted rotation around an amide bond, leading to a stable mixture of *cis* and *trans* rotamers, which are a type of diastereomer.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
