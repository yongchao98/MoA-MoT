    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis is a reasoning question that can be solved by understanding the definition of a dominant-negative mutation in the context of a dimeric protein.\n\n1.  **Define Dominant-Negative Mutation:** A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the other, normal allele. This is why it's \"dominant\" – its negative effect is seen even in a heterozygote.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The protein is a transcription factor that must form a dimer to function. The mutation (Y) is in the dimerization domain.\n\n3.  **Consider a Heterozygote (WT/Y):** In a cell with one wild-type (WT) allele and one mutant (Y) allele, both WT and Y protein subunits are made. Three types of dimers can potentially form:\n    *   **WT-WT:** Functional homodimer.\n    *   **Y-Y:** Non-functional homodimer.\n    *   **WT-Y:** Non-functional heterodimer.\n\n4.  **The \"Poisoning\" Effect:** The key is the formation of the WT-Y heterodimer. The mutant Y subunit binds to a functional WT subunit, \"trapping\" it in a non-functional complex. This sequestration of the WT protein prevents it from forming functional WT-WT dimers. This interference with the wild-type protein's function is the hallmark of a dominant-negative effect.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) While a loss-of-function phenotype is correct, aggregation is not the specific mechanism described. The core issue is interference with the wild-type protein.\n    *   B) A dominant-negative mutation causes a *loss* of function, not a gain of function.\n    *   C) The phenotype is not wild-type; if it were, the mutation would be recessive. The presence of the mutant protein causes a functional defect.\n    *   D) This option accurately describes the outcome. The mutant Y protein causes a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" by sequestering its protein product into non-functional dimers. These abnormal protein complexes are often recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation. This is the most complete and accurate molecular description of a dominant-negative mutation in this context.\n\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
