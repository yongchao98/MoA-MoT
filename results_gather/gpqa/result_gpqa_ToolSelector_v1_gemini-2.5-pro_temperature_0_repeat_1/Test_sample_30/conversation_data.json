    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a three-step organic synthesis followed by the determination of the molecular symmetry of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene to Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **Product:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. While the ortho isomer is the major product by yield, the para isomer is easily separated by crystallization due to its higher symmetry and melting point. In multi-step synthesis problems, it is a common convention to follow the path of the more easily isolated or sterically less hindered para-product.\n*   **Product 1:** We will assume Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a strong oxidation reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The oxidizing agent converts the benzylic methyl group (-CH₃) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **p-nitrobenzoic acid** (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Transformation:** p-nitrobenzoic acid is a carboxylic acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. The primary reaction is a simple acid-base neutralization. The acetone serves as a solvent. The acid proton is removed by the hydroxide ion to form water and the corresponding salt.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is the anion of p-nitrobenzoic acid, which is the **p-nitrobenzoate anion**.\n\n**Symmetry of Product 3 (p-nitrobenzoate anion)**\n*   **Structure:** The p-nitrobenzoate anion consists of a benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at para positions (positions 1 and 4).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   Due to resonance, both the carboxylate group and the nitro group are symmetric.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This plane of symmetry contains the entire molecule.\n    *   There is a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms (the substituent axis).\n    *   There is a second C₂ axis in the plane of the ring, perpendicular to the first C₂ axis and passing through the center of the ring.\n    *   There is a third C₂ axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring and passing through its center.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (i) at the center of the ring.\n    *   The combination of these elements (three perpendicular C₂ axes, three mirror planes, and a center of inversion) corresponds to the **D₂h** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is D₂h.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe user wants to determine the molecular symmetry group of a molecule produced in a three-step synthesis.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Nitration of Toluene.** Toluene reacts with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrotoluene. In such syntheses, the para isomer is often the intended product due to its ease of separation and higher symmetry. Thus, Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1.** p-Nitrotoluene is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, a strong oxidizing agent. This oxidizes the methyl group to a carboxylic acid group. Thus, Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Acid-Base Reaction.** p-Nitrobenzoic acid is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide. This is an acid-base reaction where the carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form its conjugate base. Thus, Product 3 is the p-nitrobenzoate anion.\n\n4.  **Symmetry of Product 3.** The p-nitrobenzoate anion has a benzene ring with a -COO⁻ group and a -NO₂ group at opposite (para) positions. Both substituents are themselves symmetric. The molecule has a C₂ axis along the C1-C4 bond, two other perpendicular C₂ axes, three mirror planes, and a center of inversion. This set of symmetry elements defines the D₂h point group.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
