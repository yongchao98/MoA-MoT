    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Dissociation reaction: $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$.\n    *   $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we write the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]}$\n    *   Substituting the equilibrium values: $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Since $K_d$ is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    *   $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    *   $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    *   $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    *   $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x. Therefore, the concentration is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
