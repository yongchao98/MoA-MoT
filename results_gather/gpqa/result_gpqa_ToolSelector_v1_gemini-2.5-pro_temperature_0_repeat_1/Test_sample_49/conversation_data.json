    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `4π` that appear in the expression for its amplitude.\n\nIn a quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime, the calculation for each loop integral typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` (or `1/(16π^2)`). This factor arises from the `d^4k/(2π)^4` measure of integration over the loop momentum.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The total factor from all the loop integrals will be `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression given in the problem contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this with the general form, we can set up the equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops. The other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), relate to the number of vertices in the diagram, but the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops.\n\n<<<D>>>",
