    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe solution requires a multi-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 3.\n\n1.  **Identify Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot, concentrated KOH is a known transformation that proceeds with skeletal rearrangement. The provided spectral data (IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and ¹H NMR: a highly deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm) are characteristic of **protoadamantan-4-one**, a strained tetracyclic ketone.\n\n2.  **Identify Product 2:** The next step is a reaction with aluminum isopropoxide and heat. For the subsequent ozonolysis step to be possible, Product 2 must contain a carbon-carbon double bond. This suggests a two-step sequence: a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone in Product 1 to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), followed by a Lewis acid-catalyzed dehydration (elimination of water) to form an alkene, **protoadamantene**.\n\n3.  **Identify Product 3:** The final step is the ozonolysis of Product 2 (protoadamantene) with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, breaking open one of the rings in the polycyclic system. This reaction yields a symmetric dicarbonyl compound: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.\n    *   **Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione is a highly symmetric molecule (C₂ᵥ symmetry), existing in a twin-chair conformation.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** Due to the deshielding effect of the two nearby carbonyl groups, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5).\n    *   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's consider one of these bridgehead protons, H1. It is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n        *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C8.\n        *   In the flattened chair conformation of this system, the coupling constant between the bridgehead proton (H1) and the equatorial alpha-protons (H2eq, H8eq) is often negligible (close to zero) because the dihedral angle is close to 90°.\n        *   Therefore, H1 significantly couples to two sets of protons:\n            1.  The two axial alpha-protons (H2ax and H8ax). This coupling gives a triplet.\n            2.  The two protons on the C9 methylene bridge. This coupling also gives a triplet.\n    *   Since the coupling constants for these two sets of protons are different, the resulting signal is a **triplet of triplets**.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
