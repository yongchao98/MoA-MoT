    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system at a certain temperature, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_lower) is given by:\n    N_excited / N_lower = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   g represents the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:** Let's define the \"excitation ratio\" for each star as R = N_excited / N_lower. The term (g_excited / g_lower) is a constant for the specific iron transition, let's call it C.\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Information:** We are told that the atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the excitation ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n4.  **Setting up the Equation:** Substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures:**\n    *   Cancel the constant C from both sides:\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):\n        ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n    *   Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n6.  **Using the Given Numerical Values:** The problem states the energy difference is ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1 (the units work out to be dimensionless in the exponential's argument, and the pre-factor here has units of Kelvin, but in the context of these idealized problems, it's meant to be taken as a dimensionless 1).\n    *   Substituting (ΔE / k) = 1 into our equation:\n        ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
