    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass M and rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let `m1 = 2 * m2`. The fragments are moving with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments:**\n\n*   We are given that the sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This gives `m2 = 0.33 * M` and `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\n*   Energy must be conserved. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus, `300 GeV`. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = (198 GeV + 99 GeV) + (T1 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released is `T_total = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\n*   Momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum is zero. This means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\n*   Momentum is still conserved (`p1 = p2`), but we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This can be rearranged to find momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since `E = T + m*c^2`, we can write: `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values (`T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, `m2*c^2 = 99`, all in GeV):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 201*T1 - 3*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n*   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments:**\n*   Given: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`, `m1 = 2 * m2`, and `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substituting `m1 = 2 * m2` gives `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, so `m2 = 0.33 * M` and `m1 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   The rest-mass energies are:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n*   By conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy equals the final total energy (rest mass + kinetic).\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + (T1 + T2)`\n*   `300 GeV = (198 GeV + 99 GeV) + T_total`\n*   `T_total = T1 + T2 = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n*   By conservation of momentum, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   With `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`, we get `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n*   Using the relativistic relation `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2` and the fact that momenta are equal:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1` and the rest-mass energies (all in GeV):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
