    "An analysis of the provided spectral data points to a specific structure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at **m/z = 156** indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most common isotope).\n    *   The M+2 peak at **m/z = 158** has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This ~3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak from **3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** (integrating to 1H) is in the typical region for a highly deshielded **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH).\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region, a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**, indicate a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This specific pattern (two doublets, each for two protons) is the hallmark of a **para-substituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting all the evidence together:\n*   We have a molecule with a molecular weight of 156 containing one chlorine atom.\n*   The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted (1,4) benzoic acid. Its molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol (156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope). It has a carboxylic acid and the para-substitution pattern. This is a perfect match for all the data.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Lacks a carboxylic acid proton (the aldehyde proton would be ~9-10 ppm) and would have a different aromatic splitting pattern.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe spectral data strongly supports the identification of the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n1.  **Mass Spec:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a ~3:1 intensity ratio confirm a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n2.  **IR Spec:** The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and the sharp carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ are definitive indicators of a carboxylic acid group.\n3.  **¹H NMR:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirms the carboxylic acid proton. The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n\nOf the choices provided, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all of these spectral features.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
