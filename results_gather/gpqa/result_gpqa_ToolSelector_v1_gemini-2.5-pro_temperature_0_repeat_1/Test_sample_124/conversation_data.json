    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.

The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. The degeneracy is:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.
