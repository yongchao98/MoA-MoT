    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Speed of light in the glass (rest frame of the glass):**\n    The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Velocity of the medium:**\n    The glass itself is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the speed of light `u` as observed in the laboratory frame, we cannot simply add the velocities (`u' + v`). We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    Now, we substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    To simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n/n + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*v/n )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches option B. This effect is known as the Fizeau effect or Fresnel drag.\n\n<<<B>>>",
