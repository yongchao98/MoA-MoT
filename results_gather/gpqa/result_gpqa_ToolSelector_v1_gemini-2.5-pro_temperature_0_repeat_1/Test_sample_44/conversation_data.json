    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    Using the given definition E = π²ħ² / 2mL², the energy levels for a single particle are:\n    *   E₁ = 1²E = E\n    *   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n    *   and so on...\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this case, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state energy, we must place the four particles into the lowest possible energy levels.\n    *   We can place two particles in the n=1 level.\n    *   We place the remaining two particles in the n=2 level.\n    *   The total energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        E_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    To get the first excited state, we take the ground state configuration and promote one particle to the next available higher energy level. We move one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy is:\n        E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    This is the next-lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. We must consider the possible promotions from the ground state that result in an energy higher than the first excited state.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (from the first excited state configuration). Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Energy = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   Comparing the possibilities (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state is 18E. This is the second excited state.\n\nTherefore, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe energy levels for a single spin-1/2 particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by E_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... and E = π²ħ²/2mL². Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which means a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down) can occupy any given energy level `n`.\n\n1.  **Ground State:** To achieve the lowest total energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels. We place two particles in the n=1 level and the other two in the n=2 level.\n    *   Energy = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ = 2 * (1²E) + 2 * (2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:** We create the lowest possible excitation by moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3). The configuration becomes two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₃ = 2 * (1²E) + 1 * (2²E) + 1 * (3²E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:** We need to find the next lowest energy configuration. Let's consider the possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n    *   a) Move one particle from n=2 to n=4: Energy = 2E₁ + 1E₂ + 1E₄ = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   b) Move both particles from n=2 to n=3: Energy = 2E₁ + 2E₃ = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E.\n    *   c) Move one particle from n=1 to n=3: Energy = 1E₁ + 2E₂ + 1E₃ = 1E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    The lowest energy of these possibilities is 18E.\n\nThus, the energies for the ground, first, and second excited states are 10E, 15E, and 18E.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
