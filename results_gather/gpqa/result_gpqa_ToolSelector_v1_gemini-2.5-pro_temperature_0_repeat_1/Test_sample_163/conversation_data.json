    "To solve this problem, we need to relate the observational quantities (orbital period P, radial velocity amplitudes K) to the total mass of the binary systems.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by Kepler's Third Law in a specific form:\n\nM_total * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nwhere:\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n- `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is a crucial piece of information because eclipses only occur when the inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n\nThis simplifies the mass equation to:\nM_total ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nThis means the total mass is directly proportional to P * (K1 + K2)³.\nM_total ∝ P * (K_sum)³\n\nWe can now find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nLet's plug in the values and calculate this ratio.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# For an eclipsing binary, the total mass M is proportional to P * (K_a + K_b)^3.\n# We want to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_sum = K1a + K1b\nK2_sum = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum**3)) / (P2 * (K2_sum**3))\n\nprint(f\"The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is: {mass_ratio}\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
    "The total mass of an eclipsing binary star system (where the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, so `sin³(i) ≈ 1`) is proportional to the orbital period `P` multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (`K_sum = K_a + K_b`).\n\nThe relationship is:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_sum)³`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (`M1`) to the mass of system_2 (`M2`):\n`M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]`\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `K1_sum = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K2_sum = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the ratio equation:\n`M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`M1 / M2 = [2 * 3375] / [1 * 15625]`\n`M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
