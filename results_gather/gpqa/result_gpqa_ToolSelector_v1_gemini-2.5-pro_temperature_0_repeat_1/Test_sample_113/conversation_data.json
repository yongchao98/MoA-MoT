    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nLet's break down each reaction to determine the correct reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n2.  This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n3.  To form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated.\n4.  Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, typically from adding an acid like HCl to water) is the standard reagent for this protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, which is a different reaction.\n5.  Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n1.  This transformation is called nitrile hydrolysis.\n2.  Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n3.  Reagent B is the catalyst for this hydrolysis. Comparing the options, HCl is a strong acid, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n4.  A strong acid like HCl is required to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. A weak acid would be too slow or ineffective.\n5.  Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
