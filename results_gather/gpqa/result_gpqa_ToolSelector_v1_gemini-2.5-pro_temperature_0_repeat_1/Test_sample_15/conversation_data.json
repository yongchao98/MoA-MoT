    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond and no chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar, which acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R and S), which indicate the presence of specific chiral centers. The compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer. This single enantiomer is chiral and therefore optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. In this case, both chiral centers have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Its mirror image would be the (2S, 3S) compound. As a single enantiomer, it is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH2-CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2-), making it a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer (R), which is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this symmetrically substituted cyclohexane, the all-cis isomer (which is what the notation implies) possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n>>>\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nA compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and not present as a racemic mixture. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is achiral. It has no chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond). It is optically **inactive**.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name specifies a single enantiomer with defined chiral centers (R and S configurations). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically **active**.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a classic example of a meso compound. It has two chiral centers, but the molecule as a whole is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is optically **inactive**.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer. It is optically **active**.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is optically **active**.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a highly symmetric molecule. The all-cis arrangement of the three hydroxyl groups creates multiple planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically **inactive**.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral. It is optically **inactive**.\n\nIn total, there are 3 optically active compounds.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
