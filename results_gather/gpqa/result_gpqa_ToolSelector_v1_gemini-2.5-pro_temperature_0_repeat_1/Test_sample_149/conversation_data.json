    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis of the provided information.\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DBE of 5 suggests a benzene ring (4 units) and one additional double bond (1 unit), likely a carbonyl group.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield shifts (typically < 7 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a single proton (1+1=2), which is the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group. Putting them together gives the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    *   **Step 1 & 2 (1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O):** This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The amine (-NH₂) is first converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺) via diazotization. Then, hydrolysis with water replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   The intermediate after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This step involves reacting an aldehyde that has α-protons (protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic **aldol condensation** reaction.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n            2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  An aldol addition product is formed: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n            4.  The presence of **heat** promotes the dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) of the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3). The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n3.  **Match the final product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the aldol *addition* product, formed before dehydration.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal is incorrect; it lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n    *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is incorrect; it results from the condensation of only one molecule.\n    *   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** correctly represents the final product of the aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration).\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe final product is determined by a three-step process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The molecular formula C8H9NO and the NMR data identify the starting compound as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   The signals at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H, -CHO) and 3.66 ppm (d, 2H, -CH₂-) indicate a -CH₂CHO group.\n    *   The signals at 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The signal at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) indicates a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Two Reagents:** The reaction with (1) NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by (2) H₂O, is a standard method to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. This transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Third Reagent:** The reaction with (3) aq. KOH and heat is a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons and will self-condense.\n    *   The base (KOH) facilitates the formation of an enolate, which attacks another aldehyde molecule.\n    *   The \"Heat\" condition ensures that the initial aldol addition product undergoes dehydration to form the more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n>>>\n<<<D>>>",
