    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, αₙ, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [L]ⁱ))\n\nWhere:\n*   [L] is the concentration of the ligand, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)ₙ].\n*   The denominator represents the sum of the relative amounts of all cobalt species: free Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\nLet's calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   For free Co²⁺ (n=0): β₀[L]⁰ = 1 * (0.1)⁰ = 1\n*   For [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[L]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   For [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   For [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[L]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   For [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[L]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)₂], is the term we calculated for n=2, which is 0.4.\n\nNow, calculate the fraction (α₂) of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nα₂ = (Term for n=2) / (Sum of all terms) = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the output from the code and corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
