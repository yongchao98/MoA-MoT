    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" strongly suggests a deuterated reagent. A prime candidate is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   \"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". LiAlH₄ and LiAlD₄ react violently with water. Let's assume Y is water (H₂O). The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   \"gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's check the gas produced, D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the description perfectly.\n    *   \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B\". In the reaction above, Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate. So, G is Al(OH)₃. Heating aluminum hydroxide causes decomposition: 2Al(OH)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O. So, B is water (H₂O).\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\". 277 K is 4°C. The melting point of water is 273.15 K (0°C), which is very close. This confirms B is water.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both groups to alcohols. For example, R-CO-R'-COOH would be reduced to R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Lightest and Heaviest Elements in LiAlD₄:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   Their approximate atomic masses are: D ≈ 2 amu, Li ≈ 7 amu, Al ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   It specifies: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for the number of atoms of each of these elements in the formula unit.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\n1.  **Identify Substance X:** The clues point to Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium, D). Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a common organic reagent.\n    *   It reacts with water (Y) to produce deuterium gas (W). A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the description.\n    *   The reaction also forms a precipitate, Aluminum Hydroxide (G), which upon heating releases water (B).\n    *   The melting point of water (B) is ~273 K, which is close to the given 277 K.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid to a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, ~7 amu), Aluminum (Al, ~27 amu), and Deuterium (D, ~2 amu).\n    *   Lightest element: Deuterium (D)\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum:** The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is one Al atom, so its mass is 27.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (D): There are four D atoms, so their total mass is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
