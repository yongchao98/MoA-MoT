    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction for objects moving in the same direction is:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂ / c²))\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6 c (speed of the first astronaut)\n*   v₂ = 0.5 c (speed of the second astronaut)\n*   c = speed of light\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428 c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
