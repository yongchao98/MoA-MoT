    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as N tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n- `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n- `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n- `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n- `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`, the equation becomes:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ/a) - (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n\nWe need the numerical values for the first two non-zero roots of J₁(x):\n- First root, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n- Second root, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for `Δθ`:\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\nNote: A common mistake is to calculate the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`, which is `θ₁ = z₁ / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ/a)`. This corresponds to option D, but the question asks for the distance between the first two minima.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The first two non-zero roots of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is given by delta_theta = (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi)\n\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(f\"The coefficient for lambda/a is: {coefficient}\")\n\n# Let's check the coefficient for the first minimum (related to option D)\nfirst_min_coeff = z1 / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the first minimum is: {first_min_coeff}\")\n```\n>>>"
