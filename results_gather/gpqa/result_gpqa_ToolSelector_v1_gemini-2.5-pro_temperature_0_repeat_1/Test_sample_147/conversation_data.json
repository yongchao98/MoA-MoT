    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and compound A2.**\n\nA2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YF_n. The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96% (or 0.3196).\nLet M_Y be the atomic mass of element Y, and M_F be the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction is:\nωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\nM_Y + 19.00n = (n * 19.00) / 0.3196\nM_Y + 19.00n ≈ 59.45n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45n\n\nNow, we test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass M_Y for an element Y.\n*   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08, which is chemically unlikely).\n*   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (closest is Bromine, Br=79.90, but its fluorides don't fit the other clues well).\n*   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no good chemical match).\n*   If n = 5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (no good chemical match).\n*   If n = 6, M_Y ≈ 242.70 g/mol (closest is Plutonium, Pu=244, but this leads to contradictions with other clues).\n\nThe best fit is Y = Antimony (Sb) and n = 3.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\nωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the other compounds and check for consistency.**\n\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF₃**\n*   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so A1 should be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless substance and is stable; it is formed from SbF₃ + F₂, not the other way around. This part of the problem description appears to be flawed or misleading, a common feature in complex chemistry problems. We will proceed based on the more reliable quantitative data.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Sb with F₂. This reaction produces SbF₃ or SbF₅. The clue that A3 interacts with xenon points to the stronger Lewis acid, **A3 = SbF₅**, which is known to react with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂) to form salts like [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻.\n*   **A4**: A binary fluoride of antimony that forms a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". The main binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ (colorless solid) and SbF₅ (colorless liquid/solid). Both are plausible candidates for A4.\n*   **A5**: Obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine A4 and its molecular weight.**\n\nA4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony, most likely SbF₃ or SbF₅. We can determine which one it is by calculating their molecular weights and comparing them to the given answer ranges.\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF₃**:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF₅**:\n    M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\nNow let's check the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within range **C) 160-180**.\nThe molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any range (it is close to but outside of range B).\n\nTherefore, A4 must be SbF₃. The range in which its molecular weight falls is 160-180.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We can solve this by systematically identifying the element Y and its fluoride compounds.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y**: We are given that compound A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can set up an equation to find the atomic mass of Y (M_Y) in terms of n:\n    M_Y = (n × M_F) / ωF - (n × M_F)\n    M_Y ≈ (n × 19.00) / 0.3196 - (n × 19.00) ≈ 40.45n\n    Testing integer values for n, we find that for n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is a very close match for the element Antimony (Sb), which has an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol. The calculated mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3×19)/ (121.76 + 3×19) ≈ 31.88%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, we can confidently identify Y as Sb and A2 as SbF₃.\n\n2.  **Identify A4**: A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The common binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We need to find the molecular weight of A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of both possibilities:\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3(19.00) = 178.76 g/mol\n    *   M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5(19.00) = 216.76 g/mol\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Range**: Now we compare these values with the given options:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range 160-180. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the ranges. Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe other clues in the problem are consistent with this finding, although the description of A1 appears to be flawed (a common feature in such problems to test logical deduction). The most reliable path is through the quantitative data.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is approximately 178.8 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
