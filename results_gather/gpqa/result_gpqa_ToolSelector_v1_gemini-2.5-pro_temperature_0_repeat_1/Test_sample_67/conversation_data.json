    "This is a classic problem of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. Here's the reasoning to solve it:\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a spin-1/2 particle, whose magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to its spin angular momentum `S` via the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` (i.e., `μ = γS`). Initially, the spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up state along Z, denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian, which governs the system's energy and evolution, changes to `H = -μ · B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z)`. With the new field `B` along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:** According to the principles of quantum mechanics (or classical electromagnetism for a spinning charge), a magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The Larmor frequency is given by the formula `ω_L = γB`, where `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\n5.  **Visualizing the Motion:**\n    *   At time `t=0`, the spin vector points along the +Z axis.\n    *   The new magnetic field points along the +Y axis.\n    *   The spin vector will begin to precess around the Y-axis. As it precesses, its tip traces a circle in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The projection of the spin vector onto the Z-axis is its Z-component. As the vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its Z-component will oscillate between its maximum value (along +Z) and its minimum value (along -Z).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The frequency of this oscillation for the Z-component of the spin (and thus the Z-component of the magnetic moment) is precisely the Larmor precession frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem describes the Larmor precession of a magnetic moment.\n\n1.  Initially, the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with the Z-axis.\n2.  When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y-axis, the magnetic moment starts to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis).\n3.  The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula `ω = γB`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n4.  As the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its tip traces a circle in the X-Z plane.\n5.  The Z-component of the magnetic moment is the projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis. This projection oscillates with the same frequency as the precession itself.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is the Larmor frequency, `γB`.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
