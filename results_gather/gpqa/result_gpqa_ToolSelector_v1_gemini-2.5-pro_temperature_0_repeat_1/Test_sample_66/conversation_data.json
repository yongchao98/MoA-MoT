    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem can be solved by applying the conservation rule for the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n1.  The total angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is given as $|l, m> = |2, -1>$. This means the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n2.  The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components of the two electrons, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. That is, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n3.  This relationship also holds for their corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n4.  The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n5.  An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n6.  An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n7.  For this specific measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n8.  However, the system is in a state where the total z-component quantum number is fixed at $m = -1$.\n9.  Since the sum of the measured components ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$) does not equal the total z-component of the system's state ($m = -1$), this outcome is impossible.\n10. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>",
