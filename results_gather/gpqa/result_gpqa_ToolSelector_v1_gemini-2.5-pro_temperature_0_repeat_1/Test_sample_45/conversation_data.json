    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction, specifically considering the stereochemical outcomes. This is a reasoning problem that does not require external data or complex calculations.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis. Since only one alkene, 3-methylpent-1-ene, is present, it will undergo self-metathesis. The general reaction is:\n    2 R-CH=CH₂ → R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactants and Products:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center. The problem states we start with a racemic mixture, meaning we have both (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   **Product (excluding ethene):** The R group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ (a sec-butyl group). The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry:** The reaction involves two molecules of the starting alkene. Since we start with a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, there are three possible pairings:\n    *   (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n    *   (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n    *   (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n4.  **Determine the Products from Each Pairing:** The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a new double bond (C4=C5) that can have E or Z geometry.\n\n    *   **(R) + (R) reaction:** This forms (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The new double bond can be E or Z, creating two distinct, chiral diastereomers:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n    *   **(S) + (S) reaction:** This forms (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, the double bond can be E or Z. These two products are the enantiomers of the ones formed in the (R)+(R) reaction.\n        3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n    *   **(R) + (S) reaction:** This \"cross-over\" reaction forms (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the molecule is symmetrical and has opposite configurations at its two chiral centers, these products are meso compounds (achiral). The E and Z isomers are distinct diastereomers.\n        5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n        6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n5.  **Count the Total Products:** In total, we have formed six unique, stereoisomeric products: two pairs of enantiomers (4 products) and two meso compounds (2 products). All six are chemically distinct.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe reaction is the self-metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene, catalyzed by the Grubbs catalyst. The starting material is a racemic mixture, containing both (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The reaction produces ethene and 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We need to find the number of possible stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\nThere are three possible reaction pairings from the racemic mixture:\n1.  **(R) + (R):** This reaction produces (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The newly formed double bond can be either E or Z, resulting in two chiral diastereomeric products.\n2.  **(S) + (S):** This reaction produces (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This also gives E and Z isomers, which are the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction. This adds two more distinct products.\n3.  **(R) + (S):** This reaction produces (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these are meso compounds (achiral). The E and Z isomers are distinct, achiral diastereomers. This adds another two products.\n\nIn total, we have 2 (from R+R) + 2 (from S+S) + 2 (from R+S) = 6 possible stereoisomeric products.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
