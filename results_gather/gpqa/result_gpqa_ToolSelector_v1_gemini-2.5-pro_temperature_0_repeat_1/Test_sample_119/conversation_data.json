    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Uniform Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution of stars means the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** Let's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from the observer, with a thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area (`4πd²`) times its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`.\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The relationship is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Expressing the Shell in Terms of Parallax:** We need to find how the number of stars `dN` changes with a small change in parallax, `d(plx)`. To do this, we must express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`: `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n    *   Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which is a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude of the change: `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitution:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
