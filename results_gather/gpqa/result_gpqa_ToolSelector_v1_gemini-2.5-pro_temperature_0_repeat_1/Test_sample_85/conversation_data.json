    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of different reducing agents and how stereochemistry is preserved in these reactions.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material (A and B):** The name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" describes a molecule that is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-isobutyl) at the other. The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which has an ethyl group attached.\n    *   **Product:** The product, \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one,\" is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the carbon at position 4 (C4) in the lactone ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    The formation of the lactone product from the starting acid-ester requires two steps:\n    *   **Reduction:** One of the two carbonyl groups (from the acid or the ester) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    *   **Cyclization (Lactonization):** The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the remaining carbonyl group in an intramolecular reaction to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity:**\n    The key to this problem is the different selectivities of the two reducing agents:\n    *   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids. It will *not* typically reduce an ester group in the same molecule.\n    *   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** This is a stronger reducing agent. While it can reduce both esters and carboxylic acids, it is generally more reactive and faster at reducing esters than carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:**\n    In both reaction pathways, the reduction and the cyclization occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5), which are not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the configuration (R or S) of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction. An (R) starting material will produce an (R) product, and an (S) starting material will produce an (S) product.\n\n5.  **Combine the Information:**\n    *   **Reaction A:** `A + LiBH4 ---> (R)-product`. Since LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester and stereochemistry is retained, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n        *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    *   **Reaction B:** `B + BH3 ---> (S)-product`. Since BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid and stereochemistry is retained, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n        *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, A is the (R)-enantiomer and B is the (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
