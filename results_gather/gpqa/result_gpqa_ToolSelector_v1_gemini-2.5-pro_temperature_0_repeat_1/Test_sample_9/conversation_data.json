    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Planet a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a planet identical to Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline for comparison.\n\n2.  **Planet b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Planet c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material (its core and mantle) to a much greater degree. This compression means that the volume does not increase as fast as the mass, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n4.  **Planet d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as above, a less massive planet has weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its materials compared to Earth. Therefore, this planet will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has Earth's density (~5.5 g/cm³).\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) is more massive and therefore more compressed, making it denser than Earth.\n*   Planet (d) is less massive and therefore less compressed, making it less dense than Earth.\n\nComparing the options, the planet described in (c) will have the highest density due to gravitational compression.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo determine which planet has the highest density, we need to consider the relationship between a rocky planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\n1.  **Planet (a)** is our baseline, with the density of Earth (~5.5 g/cm³).\n2.  **Planet (b)** is explicitly stated to have a density of ~5.5 g/cm³, which is about the same as Earth's.\n3.  **Planet (c)** has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. For a planet with the same rocky/iron composition, a higher mass leads to stronger gravitational self-compression. This compression squeezes the material into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy, resulting in a significantly higher overall density. Therefore, planet (c) is denser than Earth.\n4.  **Planet (d)** has the same composition but is half as massive as Earth. With less mass, there is less gravitational compression, so its material is \"fluffier\" or less compact. This results in a lower density than Earth.\n\nComparing the four scenarios, planet (c) is the only one that must be significantly denser than Earth. Therefore, it has the highest density.\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
