    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = AσT⁴, where A is the surface area (4πR²), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** According to Wien's Displacement Law, the surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted): T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n\n4.  **Relating Observed and Emitted Wavelengths:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the Doppler effect. For a star moving away from us (positive radial velocity), the light is redshifted. The non-relativistic formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n    This can be rearranged to find the emitted wavelength:\n    λ_emitted = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)\n\n5.  **Calculating Emitted Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0. So, λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁ / (1 + 0/c) = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_emitted₂ = λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). Let's substitute the expressions for the emitted wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = [λ_obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_obs₁\n    Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, this simplifies to:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute all the pieces back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 299,792 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 299792)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
