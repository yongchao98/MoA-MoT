    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving concepts from special relativity and particle physics. I will perform the calculation to find the required resolution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Relativistic Effects**: The particle $X^0$ has a total energy (E = 27 GeV) much greater than its rest mass energy ($mc^2$ = 3.41 GeV), which means it's traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. We need to account for relativistic time dilation.\n\n2.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the total energy to the rest mass energy:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    $\\gamma = E / (mc^2) = 27 \\text{ GeV} / 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Mean Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$)**: The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n4.  **Mean Decay Length ($L$)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    A more direct way to calculate this is using momentum. The momentum $p$ is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The decay length is $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$. Combining these gives:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Question**: \"To observe at least 30% of the decays\" means we need a detector with a resolution fine enough to see the track of the particle before it decays for at least 30% of the $X^0$ particles. If the detector's resolution is $d_{min}$, we can only \"observe\" a decay if the particle travels a distance $x \\ge d_{min}$.\n\n6.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$. We need this probability to be at least 0.30.\n    $P(x \\ge d_{min}) = e^{-d_{min}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n7.  **Calculating Minimum Resolution ($d_{min}$)**: To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{min}/L} = 0.30$\n    $-d_{min}/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{min} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nThe calculation requires these steps, so I will use the CODE action.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm_c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the momentum-energy term (pc)\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2  => pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc = math.sqrt(E**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# 2.

    "The reasoning and calculation performed in the previous step are correct. Let's summarize the process to confirm the result.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) and related terms**: The Lorentz factor relates the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**: The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is dilated to $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The particle travels at a velocity $v$ very close to $c$. The mean distance it travels before decaying is the mean decay length, $L$. A precise way to calculate this is:\n    $L = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    We find the momentum term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{729 - 11.63} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n    Now, we can calculate L:\n    $L = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This matches the code output for the mean decay length.\n\n3.  **Determine the Required Resolution**: The decay of particles follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or greater before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance at least equal to the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we set the probability to 0.30.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\n    To solve for $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d_{res} = L \\times 1.204 = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n    *   B) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\n    *   C) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\n    *   D) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nOur calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is very close in value and identical in order of magnitude to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 9%) is likely due to slight variations in the constants or input values used to create the problem. Option D is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
