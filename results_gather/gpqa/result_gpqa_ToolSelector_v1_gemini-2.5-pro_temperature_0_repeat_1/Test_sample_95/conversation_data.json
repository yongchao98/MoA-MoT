    "This is a multi-step physics calculation that requires combining several formulas and physical constants. To ensure accuracy and avoid calculation errors, it's best to use a computational tool.\n\n1.  **Find the physical size:** The physical diameter (D) of the event horizon can be found from its angular size (θ) and the distance (d) using the small-angle approximation: D = d * θ. We must convert d from parsecs to meters and θ from degrees to radians.\n2.  **Find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs):** The diameter is twice the Schwarzschild radius, so Rs = D / 2.\n3.  **Find the area (A):** The area of the event horizon (a sphere) is A = 4 * π * Rs².\n4.  **Calculate the entropy (S):** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is given by the formula S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nExecuting these steps with the given values and constants will yield the entropy.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Physical constants\nG = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\nk_B = 1.380649e-23 # Boltzmann constant in J/K\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34 # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\n\n# Given values\nd_parsec = 10**10  # Distance in parsecs\ntheta_deg = 10**-17 # Angular size in degrees\n\n# --- Step 1: Convert units ---\n# Convert distance from parsecs to meters\nm_per_parsec = 3.086e16\nd_m = d_parsec * m_per_parsec\n\n# Convert angular size from degrees to radians\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the physical size (diameter) of the event horizon ---\n# Using the small-angle approximation: D = d * theta\nD_eh = d_m * theta_rad\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius ---\nR_s = D_eh / 2\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon ---\nA = 4 * math.pi * R_s**2\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy ---\nS = (k_B * c**3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nprint(f\"The entropy of the black hole is approximately: {S:.2e} J/K\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Convert Units:** First, we need to convert the given distance and angular size into standard SI units (meters and radians).\n    *   Distance `d`: 1 parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n        `d = 10¹⁰ parsecs * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/parsec) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m`\n    *   Angular size `θ`: 1 degree is π/180 radians.\n        `θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180 radians/degree) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Physical Size (Schwarzschild Radius):** Using the small-angle approximation, the diameter `D` of the event horizon is `D = d * θ`. The Schwarzschild radius `Rs` is half of the diameter.\n    *   `D = (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m`\n    *   `Rs = D / 2 ≈ 2.692 x 10⁷ m`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon:** The area `A` of the event horizon (a sphere) is given by `A = 4 * π * Rs²`.\n    *   `A = 4 * π * (2.692 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy `S` of a black hole is given by the formula:\n    `S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`\n    Where:\n    *   `k_B` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `G` (gravitational constant) ≈ 6.67 x 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\n    *   `ħ` (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.05 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `S ≈ ( (1.38e-23) * (3.00e8)³ * (9.11e15) ) / ( 4 * (6.67e-11) * (1.05e-34) )`\n    `S ≈ ( 3.39e18 ) / ( 2.80e-44 )`\n    `S ≈ 1.21 x 10⁶² J/K`\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.21 x 10⁶² J/K. This corresponds to an order of magnitude of 10⁶², which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
