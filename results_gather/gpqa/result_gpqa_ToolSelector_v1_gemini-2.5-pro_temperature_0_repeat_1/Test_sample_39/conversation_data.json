    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is common slang in organic chemistry labs. It almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the most common method for separating and purifying compounds.\n\n1.  **Chromatography:** Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography separate molecules based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily governed by the compound's **polarity**.\n2.  **The Visual:** On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same rate, resulting in their spots overlapping or being \"on top of each other.\" Similarly, in column chromatography, they would elute from the column at the same time, resulting in overlapping peaks on a chromatogram.\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of poor separation in chromatography, which perfectly matches the slang term.\n    *   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used for analysis *after* a compound is purified; it is not a basis for this type of separation.\n    *   **C) Non-covalent bonding:** While possible, this is a much less common reason for separation failure, and the phrase is not the typical way to describe it. The primary reason for co-elution is similar physical properties.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. The slang \"on top of each other\" is strongly associated with the visual output of chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is referring to a failed separation via chromatography because the compounds have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<A>>>",
