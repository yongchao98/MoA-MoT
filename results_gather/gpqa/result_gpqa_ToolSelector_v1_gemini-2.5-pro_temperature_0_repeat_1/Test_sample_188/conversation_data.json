    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis question requires distinguishing between different types of particles or excitations that arise in physical systems. The key concept is spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and its consequences, particularly Goldstone's theorem.\n\n*   **Goldstone's Theorem:** This theorem states that for every continuous global symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless particle, known as a Goldstone boson, must exist. If the symmetry is only approximate (i.e., also explicitly broken by a small amount), the resulting particle is a \"pseudo-Goldstone boson\" and has a small mass.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this theorem:\n\n*   **A) Phonon:** In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken by the formation of a periodic lattice. The Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry are the acoustic phonons.\n*   **C) Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the spins of the atoms align in a specific direction, spontaneously breaking the continuous rotational symmetry of the system. The Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry are magnons (the quanta of spin waves).\n*   **D) Pion:** In the theory of the strong nuclear force (QCD), an approximate symmetry called chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. The pions are the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons (they have a small mass because the chiral symmetry is not exact).\n*   **B) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is fundamentally different from the others. It is not a Goldstone boson. Instead, it is a topological soliton—a stable, particle-like, non-linear excitation of a field. Skyrmions exist in systems that have undergone spontaneous symmetry breaking (for example, as stable configurations in the pion field or as magnetic textures in a ferromagnet), but they are not the Goldstone bosons that are the direct consequence of the broken symmetry itself.\n\nTherefore, phonons, magnons, and pions are all (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons directly resulting from a spontaneously broken symmetry. The skyrmion is a different type of entity.\n\n<<<B>>>",
