    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm signal is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both the methyl group and a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-), which is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), the other methyl group, and the methylene group.\n\n*   **Assembling Compound X:**\n    *   The fragments are a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a para-substituted benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n    *   Putting them together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** Red P and HI form a powerful reducing system. This combination is strong enough to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The rest of the molecule (the sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring) remains unchanged.\n*   **Product Structure:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not the sec-butyl group from the starting material.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>",
