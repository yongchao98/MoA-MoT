    "The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive to travel a distance `R` is given by the exponential decay law, where the time is considered in the particle's own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`).\n\n`f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\nwhere `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\nDue to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n\n`f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value is constant for this experiment since the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe are given two cases:\n\n**Case 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Case 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `K` we found from Case 1:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nUsing the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
