    "To solve this problem, we need to use dimensional analysis in the context of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in 4 spacetime dimensions, using natural units where `ħ = c = 1`.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density.**\nThe action, `S = ∫ d⁴x L`, must be dimensionless. The spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[d⁴x]_M = -4`. Therefore, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L]_M = 4` to make the action dimensionless.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mass dimensions of the fields.**\nWe find the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian.\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term is `L_fermion ∝ ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have `[L_fermion]_M = [ψ̄]_M + [∂_μ]_M + [ψ]_M = 4`. Since `[∂_μ]_M = 1` and `[ψ̄]_M = [ψ]_M`, we get `2[ψ]_M + 1 = 4`, which gives `[ψ]_M = 3/2`.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term is `L_EM ∝ F_μνF^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have `[L_EM]_M = [F_μν]_M + [F^μν]_M = 2[F^μν]_M = 4`, which gives `[F^μν]_M = 2`.\n*   **The tensor σ_μν:** This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, `[σ_μν]_M = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ.**\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κψ̄σ_μνψF^μν`. The total mass dimension of this term must also be 4.\n`[L_int]_M = [κ]_M + [ψ̄]_M + [σ_μν]_M + [ψ]_M + [F^μν]_M = 4`\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n`[κ]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ]_M + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ]_M + 5 = 4`\n`[κ]_M = -1`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the renormalizability of the theory.**\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If `[coupling]_M > 0`, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If `[coupling]_M = 0`, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If `[coupling]_M < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince we found `[κ]_M = -1`, which is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we perform a dimensional analysis in 4 spacetime dimensions.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimensions of Components:**\n    *   The action `S = ∫d⁴x L` is dimensionless. Since `[d⁴x]_M = -4`, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L]_M = 4`.\n    *   The mass dimension of a fermion field `ψ` is `[ψ]_M = 3/2`.\n    *   The mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor `F^μν` is `[F^μν]_M = 2`.\n    *   The term `σ_μν` is a combination of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: `[σ_μν]_M = 0`.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of κ:**\n    The interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κψ̄σ_μνψF^μν` must have a mass dimension of 4. We can write the dimensional equation as:\n    `[L_int]_M = [κ]_M + [ψ̄]_M + [σ_μν]_M + [ψ]_M + [F^μν]_M`\n    `4 = [κ]_M + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n    `4 = [κ]_M + 3 + 2`\n    `4 = [κ]_M + 5`\n    `[κ]_M = -1`\n\n3.  **Renormalizability:**\n    A theory is considered non-renormalizable if any of its coupling constants have a negative mass dimension. Since `[κ]_M = -1`, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<A>>>",
