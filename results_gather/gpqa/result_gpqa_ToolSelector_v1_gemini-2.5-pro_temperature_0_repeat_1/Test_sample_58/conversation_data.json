    "This is a stoichiometry and acid-base chemistry problem that requires several calculation steps. I will calculate the moles of each reactant, determine the limiting and excess reagents after neutralization, and then calculate the final pH of the resulting solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acid and base species:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.500 L * 0.1 M = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ (from strong acid HCl) = 0.400 L * 0.2 M = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- (from strong base Ba(OH)2) = 0.300 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.180 mol (since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per formula unit).\n\n2.  **Perform neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (H+) reacts with the strong base (OH-):\n        *   H+ + OH- -> H2O\n        *   Initial moles: 0.080 mol H+, 0.180 mol OH-\n        *   After reaction: 0 mol H+, (0.180 - 0.080) = 0.100 mol OH- remaining.\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH):\n        *   CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Initial moles: 0.050 mol CH3COOH, 0.100 mol OH-\n        *   After reaction: 0 mol CH3COOH, (0.100 - 0.050) = 0.050 mol OH- in excess.\n        *   0.050 mol of CH3COO- (acetate) is formed.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH-) and 0.050 moles of a weak base (CH3COO-). The pH will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base.\n    *   Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Final concentration of OH- = Moles / Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-]) = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe calculation is non-trivial and best performed by a script to ensure accuracy.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions and calculate moles\n# Acetic acid (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500  # L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1   # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\n# HCl (strong acid)\nvol_hcl = 0.400  # L\nconc_hcl = 0.2   # M\nmoles_h_plus = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n\n# Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300  # L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3   # M\n# Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-\nmoles_oh_minus = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2 * 2\n\nprint(f\"Initial moles CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles H+ (from HCl): {moles_h_plus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles OH- (from Ba(OH)2): {moles_oh_minus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\n# Strong acid vs. Strong base\nif moles_h_plus > 0 and moles_oh_minus > 0:\n    if moles_h_plus >= moles_oh_minus:\n        moles_h_plus -= moles_oh_minus\n        moles_oh_minus = 0\n    else:\n        moles_oh_minus -= moles_h_plus\n        moles_h_plus = 0\n\nprint(f\"Moles OH- after reacting with HCl: {moles_oh_minus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles H+ after reacting with Ba(OH)2: {moles_h_plus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Remaining strong species vs. Weak acid\nmoles_ch3coo_minus = 0\nif moles_oh_minus > 0 and moles_ch3cooh > 0:\n    if moles_oh_minus >= moles_ch3cooh:\n        moles_ch3coo_minus = moles_ch3cooh\n        moles_oh_minus -= moles_ch3cooh\n        moles_ch3cooh = 0\n    else:\n        moles_ch3coo_minus = moles_oh_minus\n        moles_ch3cooh -= moles_oh_minus\n        moles_oh_minus = 0\n\nprint(f\"Final moles of excess OH-: {moles_oh_minus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Final moles of CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.3f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Final moles of CH3COO-: {moles_ch3coo_minus:.3f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate final pH\n# The pH is determined by the excess strong base (OH-)\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\nprint(f\"Total Volume: {total_volume:.3f} L\")\n\nif moles_oh_minus > 0:\n    # Excess strong base determines pH\n    conc_oh_minus = moles_oh_minus / total_volume\n    poh = -math.log10(conc_oh_minus)\n    ph = 14 - poh\n    print(f\"Final [OH-]: {conc_oh_minus:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"pOH: {poh:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Final pH: {ph:.2f}\")\nelif moles_h_plus > 0:\n    # Excess strong acid would determine pH\n    conc_h_plus = moles_h_plus / total_volume\n    ph = -math.log10(conc_h_plus)\n    print(f\"Final [H+]: {conc_h_plus:.5f} M\")\n    print(f\"Final pH: {ph:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    # This case would involve a buffer or hydrolysis, but here we have excess strong base.\n    print(\"Solution composition requires buffer or hydrolysis calculation.\")\n\n```\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
