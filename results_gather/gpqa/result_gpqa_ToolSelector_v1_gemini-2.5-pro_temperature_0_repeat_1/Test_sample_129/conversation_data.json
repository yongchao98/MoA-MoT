    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nTo solve this, we need to determine the minimum redshift required to shift the Lyman-alpha wavelength from the ultraviolet spectrum into the optical spectrum observable by ground-based telescopes.\n\n1.  **Rest Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition has a rest-frame wavelength of `λ_em = 1216 Å`. This is in the far-ultraviolet range.\n\n2.  **Observational Limit:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere becomes transparent at wavelengths longer than approximately 3500 Å (350 nm). This is the shortest wavelength we can observe from the ground, so `λ_obs_min ≈ 3500 Å`.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The relationship between observed wavelength (`λ_obs`), emitted wavelength (`λ_em`), and redshift (`z`) is given by the formula:\n    `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Lower Limit:** To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the minimum observable wavelength from the ground and solve for `z`:\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_em) - 1`\n    `z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    `z ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    `z ≈ 1.878`\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
