    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the state of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\nLet's define the terms as given in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge $q$ at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: Observation point (field point).\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the signal travels.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The retarded time condition is $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c}$, or $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and are given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator by factoring out $1/c$:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the potential expressions:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n*   A and D use the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects the retardation effect and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n*   C has an incorrect sign ($+$ instead of $-$) in the denominator. The term $-\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ accounts for the Doppler-like effect on the potential due to the source's motion.\n\nTherefore, option B correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>",
