    "This problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n**1. The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n\n**2. Applying the Theorem**\n\n*   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states the field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n\n*   **Volume (V):** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Surface (S):** The enclosing surface is the surface of this sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface element vector `dS` points radially outward and has a magnitude of `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, `dS = r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n\nWe need to evaluate the dot product `f ⋅ dS` on the surface of the sphere, where `r = R`.\n\n*   On the surface, the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n*   The dot product is:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n*   Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from 0 to `π`, and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n\n∮ (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n*   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   Now, integrate with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2 * (2π) = 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n\n∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π\n\nNote: Although the vector field `f` is singular at the origin (r=0), the Divergence Theorem can still be applied. This is a classic result from electrostatics (Gauss's Law for a point charge), where the divergence of such a field is a Dirac delta function at the origin, `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ(r)`, the integral of which over the volume is `4π`.\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. The vector field is given as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, and the volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe most direct way to solve this is by using the Divergence Theorem, which states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`, which is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n1.  **Define the terms for the surface integral:**\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface element vector `dS` for a sphere points radially outward and is given by `dS = r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    `f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r̂ ) ⋅ ( r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ )`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the `R^2` terms cancel out:\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n3.  **Evaluate the surface integral:**\n    The integral is taken over the entire surface of the sphere, with `θ` ranging from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(φ=0 to 2π) ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n    `∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ = 2π`\n    The total integral is the product of these two results: `2 * 2π = 4π`.\n\nTherefore, the value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
