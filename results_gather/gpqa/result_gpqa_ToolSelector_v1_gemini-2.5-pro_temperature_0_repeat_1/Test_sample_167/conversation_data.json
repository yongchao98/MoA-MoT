    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nHere is a breakdown of why each option is or is not a common source of *difficult-to-spot erroneous results*:\n\n1.  **Mutually incompatible data formats:** This is a very common issue, but it typically results in an immediate and obvious error. A tool expecting a BAM file that receives a VCF file will almost always crash or throw a \"file format error.\" Because the analysis fails to run, it doesn't usually generate an erroneous *result*, making it easy to spot.\n\n2.  **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion:** This is a classic and insidious problem. One file might use \"chr1\" while another uses \"1\" to denote chromosome 1. Tools may not report an error; they will simply fail to find matching regions, leading to data being silently dropped from the analysis. This can drastically and quietly skew results.\n\n3.  **Reference assembly mismatch:** This is another extremely common and hard-to-detect source of error. If you align reads to one genome build (e.g., hg19) but use gene annotations from another (e.g., hg38), the genomic coordinates will be incorrect. The software will run without complaint, but the results (like variant calls or expression counts) will be assigned to the wrong genes or genomic features, making the biological conclusions completely invalid.\n\n4.  **Incorrect ID conversion:** Converting between different types of gene or protein identifiers (e.g., Ensembl, RefSeq, Entrez, HGNC symbols) is fraught with ambiguity and changes over time. Using an outdated or incorrect mapping can lead to genes being dropped, misidentified, or aggregated incorrectly, which silently corrupts downstream functional analyses (like pathway enrichment).\n\nBased on this analysis, issues 2, 3, and 4 are all common sources of errors that are very difficult to spot because the analysis tools often run to completion without any warnings. Issue 1, while common, typically causes obvious failures rather than subtle, incorrect results. Therefore, the most accurate option includes 2, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
