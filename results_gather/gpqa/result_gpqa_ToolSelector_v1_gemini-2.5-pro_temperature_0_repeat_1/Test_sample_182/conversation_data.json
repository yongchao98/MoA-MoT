    "Answering this question requires understanding the chemical reaction and then calculating the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the resulting product. This can be solved by reasoning about the structures.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction:**\n*   The combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n*   Specifically, it will reduce:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde (formyl) group (-CHO) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring to a single bond.\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) to a single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant and Product:**\n*   **Reactant Structure:** The reactant molecule has several features that contribute to its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A six-membered ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n    *   A C=C double bond in the ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n    *   A C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid (contributes 1 to IHD).\n    *   A C=O double bond in the formyl group (contributes 1 to IHD).\n    *   A C=C double bond in the vinyl group (contributes 1 to IHD).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** After the complete reduction, all the double bonds are converted to single bonds. The only feature that remains which contributes to the IHD is the ring structure itself. The product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n*   The index of hydrogen deficiency is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   Since the product is a saturated molecule (all single bonds) that contains a single ring, its IHD is **1**.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction reaction. This powerful reducing agent will convert all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds into saturated alkanes.\n\n1.  **Functional Group Reduction:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to a single bond, forming an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\n2.  **Product Structure:**\n    The starting molecule has a ring and several double bonds. After the reaction, all the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are eliminated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) that remains is the ring structure itself. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. Since the final product is a saturated cycloalkane (it has one ring but no double or triple bonds), its IHD is 1.\n>>>\n<<<A>>>",
