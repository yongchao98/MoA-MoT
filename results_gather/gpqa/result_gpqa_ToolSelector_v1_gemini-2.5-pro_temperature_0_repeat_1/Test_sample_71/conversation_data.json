    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's break down the reaction sequence step-by-step to identify the final product, 4, and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI is a reductive dehalogenation that generates a highly reactive diene in situ. The two -CHBr₂ groups are converted into two exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂). The reactive species formed is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n*   This newly formed diene then reacts with the norbornadiene derivative in a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. The norbornadiene acts as the dienophile. Since 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, both double bonds of the norbornadiene react in two separate Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Product 1** is the resulting symmetric double-adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acidic deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position of the norbornane core is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product 2** is the diol... wait, the alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation of the secondary alcohol at C7 to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3** is the ketone derivative of the double-adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Heat (150 °C).\n*   **Reaction:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Product 3 will fragment back into its constituent diene and dienophile.\n    *   The dienophile part is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at this temperature, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   The diene part is the **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** that was generated in Step 1. Since two equivalents were used to make the double-adduct, two molecules of this diene are released.\n*   **Final Products:** The final reaction mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n**Identifying Product 4 and Counting its Hydrogens**\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". This implies a single molecular species. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1.  **Benzene:** In benzene, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry. It would show only **1** signal in an ¹H NMR spectrum. This is not among the options.\n2.  **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene:** This molecule is also a final product and is stable under the reaction conditions. We must analyze its structure to determine the number of distinct hydrogens.\n\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at C5 and C6.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry makes pairs of atoms chemically equivalent.\n        *   The C₂ axis interchanges C1 and C4, so their attached hydrogens (H1, H4) are equivalent. **(Signal 1)**\n        *   The C₂ axis interchanges C2 and C3, so their attached hydrogens (H2, H3) are equivalent. **(Signal 2)**\n        *   The C₂ axis interchanges the two exocyclic =CH₂ groups (at C5 and C6).\n        *   Within one =CH₂ group (e.g., at C5), the two geminal protons are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because one is closer to the C4-H group and the other is closer to the C6=CH₂ group. Let's call them H5a and H5b.\n        *   Due to the C₂ symmetry, H5a is equivalent to H6a, and H5b is equivalent to H6b. This gives two more signals. **(Signal 3 for H5a/H6a and Signal 4 for H5b/H6b)**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nSince 4 is one of the options (C), and 1 (for benzene) is not, it is clear that \"final product 4\" refers to the regenerated diene.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe multi-step synthesis involves the following transformations:\n1.  **Formation of a reactive diene:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with sodium iodide (NaI) to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene via reductive dehalogenation.\n2.  **Diels-Alder Reaction:** This diene reacts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative). Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, forming a symmetric adduct (Product 1).\n3.  **Deprotection:** The tert-butyl ether in Product 1 is hydrolyzed with aqueous acid to an alcohol (Product 2).\n4.  **Oxidation:** The alcohol in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (Product 3) using SO₃/pyridine (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n5.  **Thermolysis:** Heating Product 3 at 150°C induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This fragmentation yields two main organic products:\n    *   The original dienophile core, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule readily loses carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable product, benzene.\n    *   Two molecules of the original diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, 4. We have two potential organic products: benzene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   Benzene has only one type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry. \"1\" is not an option.\n*   Let's analyze 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The molecule has C₂ symmetry.\n    1.  The two hydrogens on the inner double bonds (at C2 and C3) are equivalent.\n    2.  The two hydrogens on the outer ends of the ring's diene system (at C1 and C4) are equivalent to each other, but different from the first set.\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups are equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent).\n    4.  One set of equivalent methylene protons (one from each CH₂ group).\n    5.  The other set of equivalent methylene protons (the other proton from each CH₂ group).\nThis results in a total of 4 distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This matches option C. Therefore, product 4 is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
