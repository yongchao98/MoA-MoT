    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of a multi-step organic reaction sequence, followed by a structural analysis of the final product to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This can be solved through chemical reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:** This is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2:** This reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base and heat, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    *   The mechanism involves deprotonation at the other α-carbon (C6), formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, and subsequent ring-opening by the hydroxide ion.\n    *   Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n    *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4:** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to the number of unique signals expected in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n\n```\n      H(a)-C=O\n          |\n         /C1\\\n      H(b)|\n        /   \\\n   (c)H₂C-----CH₂(c)\n       |       |\n   (d)H₂C-----CH₂(d)\n```\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (Hₐ):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Proton on C1 (Hₑ):** This proton is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group and is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5 (the 'c' positions):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond. This plane makes the C2 position equivalent to the C5 position. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because one is *cis* and the other is *trans* with respect to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) form one set, and the two *trans* protons form another set. This gives 2 distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4 (the 'd' positions):** Similarly, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct sets of hydrogens (the *cis*-like set and the *trans*-like set). This gives another 2 distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Counting the distinct types:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1 H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 *cis* H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 *trans* H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 *cis*-like H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 *trans*-like H's (2 protons)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the products in a four-step reaction sequence, followed by an analysis of the final product's structure to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**. This is an α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH/heat → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**. These are the conditions for a Favorskii rearrangement, where the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂ → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAl(OtBu)₃H → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**. This is a selective reduction of an acid chloride to an aldehyde.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we analyze its structure for symmetry:\n*   The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is unique (1 type).\n*   The proton on the carbon bearing the aldehyde group (C1) is unique (1 type).\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the C1-CHO bond. This makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C5, and protons on C3 equivalent to those on C4.\n*   However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is cis, one is trans to the -CHO group) and thus are not equivalent to each other. This gives two sets of protons for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic, giving another two sets of protons for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
