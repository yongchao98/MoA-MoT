    "This problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of relativistic energy.\n\n1.  **Total Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle in a potential `U(x)` is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy. The relativistic energy itself is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy. A more direct way to write the conserved total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, $U(x)$ is the potential energy, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy:** For a harmonic oscillator with force $F = -kx$, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** The total energy $E_{total}$ must be constant throughout the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at two key points:\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$. This means $\\gamma = 1$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + U(A) = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is $U(0) = 0$. The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solving for v_max:** By the conservation of energy, we can set the two expressions for $E_{total}$ equal to each other:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n5.  Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n7.  To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides and then square them:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n8.  Rearrange the terms to isolate $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n9.  Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem is solved by applying the principle of conservation of total relativistic energy. The total energy of the system, $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$, is constant.\n\n1.  At the point of maximum amplitude, $x=A$, the velocity is $v=0$. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is equal to 1. The potential energy is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n2.  At the equilibrium position, $x=0$, the velocity is maximum, $v=v_{max}$. The potential energy is $U(0)=0$. The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}mc^2$\n\n3.  By conservation of energy, we equate the two expressions for total energy:\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  Solving for the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n5.  Squaring both sides after inverting gives:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n6.  Rearranging to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
