    "<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThis is a classic physics problem that can be solved by modeling the oscillating charge distribution as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    An oscillating spheroid with a symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole `p(t)` oriented along the z-axis. The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by such a dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment and frequency, and `θ` is the angle with respect to the oscillation axis (the z-axis).\n\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value of 1. This happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`. Let's call this `P_30`.\n    `P_30 = C * sin²(30°)`\n    Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, `P_30 = C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The constant `C` in the formula above is not actually constant with respect to frequency or wavelength. The full formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ p₀² * ω⁴ * sin²(θ)`\n    where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment and `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n    The function `f` in the question is this power per unit solid angle. We are interested in its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n    `ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    Therefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    So, a possible form for the dependence of `f` on `λ` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction is 1/4 and the functional form is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
