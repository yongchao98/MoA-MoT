    "This is a multi-step chemical equilibrium problem that requires precise calculation. I will calculate the concentrations of the buffer components, determine the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution, and then use that to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion.\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the initial species.**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    *   The solution is a buffer made of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n    *   Using the equilibrium constant expression:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n    *   Using the equilibrium constant expression:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] = 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<\nACTION: CODE\nGUIDANCE:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_kh2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_na2hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer species\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_kh2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_na2hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"Initial concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_h2po4_minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_hpo4_2minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [H+] = {conc_H_plus:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"Final concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) = {conc_po4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation shows that the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO₄³⁻], is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B.\n\nThe steps were:\n1.
