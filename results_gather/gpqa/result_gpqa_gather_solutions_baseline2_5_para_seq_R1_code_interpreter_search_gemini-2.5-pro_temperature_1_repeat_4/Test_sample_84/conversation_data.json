The variations in the selected letter options (A, B, C, D) are artifacts of the agents being presented with randomized lists of choices, not from any disagreement on the correct answer itself. The following analysis synthesizes their consistent reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The objective is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**: The semi-major axis can be found using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) via the proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}} $$\n    Crucially, the problem states the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed edge-on, so the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The relationship simplifies to $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging to solve for $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Simplify**: Now we substitute the expression for `a` into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squared terms cancel each other out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, so their ratios are identical ($K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$). We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem is deliberately filled with unnecessary data (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the forbidden line). Recognizing that all these values cancel out in a ratio calculation is a key test of conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Significance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination `i` for both planets is ~90°, which means $\\sin(i)$ is ~1. Without this assumption, the problem would be unsolvable as `i` would be an unknown variable.\n3.  **Index Tracking and Ratio Inversion**: It is essential to correctly derive the final formula and track the subscripts. Note that the temperature ratio $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$ leads to a final formula with an *inverted* mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) but a *non-inverted* velocity/Doppler shift ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Mistaking this would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., ~1.05 or ~1.87, which are likely distractors).\n4.  **The Power of Proportionality**: The most efficient path to the solution involves working with ratios and proportionalities from the beginning. This allows for the cancellation of physical constants (like G) and system parameters without needing to calculate any intermediate absolute values (like the actual orbital distance in meters).\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: A particularly elegant feature of the derivation is the cancellation of the square root in the temperature relationship with the squared terms that arise from the radial velocity relationship. This simplifies the final calculation significantly.\n6.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: One must understand that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratios are identical. There is no need to perform any unit conversions or use the speed of light.\n\nBased on the robust calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536, which is closest to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Goal and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these terms, along with the constant '2', cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to a relationship dependent only on the planets' semi-major axes ($a$):\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now to find the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). The proportionality is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nA crucial clue is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both.\n\nRearranging the simplified proportionality ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for `a` gives:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas and Derive the Final Expression**\n\nFirst, we establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple, elegant final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nThe final result is $15 / 28 \\approx 0.5357$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These values cancel out when forming a ratio and are included to test a conceptual understanding of the underlying physics.\n*   **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is necessary to simplify the RV formula and make the planets' effects directly comparable without an unknown inclination factor.\n*   **Index Management**: Careful derivation is necessary to arrive at the correct final formula. Note that the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on an inverted mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and a non-inverted velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Mistaking the mass ratio for $M_1/M_2$ would lead to the incorrect answer of ~1.05.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity (in m/s) is necessary.\n*   **Elegant Simplification**: A key part of the solution is the algebraic step where the square root in the temperature ratio formula cancels with the squared terms in the semi-major axis ratio formula. This simplifies the calculation and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final calculated value is approximately 0.536. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe value 0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles, mathematical derivation, and final numerical result. The variation in the final letter choices is an artifact of the agents receiving differently ordered multiple-choice lists. The core logic is sound and consistent across all detailed explanations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, the star's temperature ($T_{star}$) and radius ($R_{star}$) are constants that cancel out in the ratio. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels. This leaves a greatly simplified relationship based only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star by a planet in a circular orbit has the following proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial detail is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, allowing us to assume the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ for both, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The relationship simplifies to $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Formula**\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the proportionality from Step 2:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel perfectly, leaving a simple and elegant final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nWe plug in the values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nThe calculation gives a numerical result of $15/28 \\approx 0.5357$. This value is closest to **0.53**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the spectral line). These values all cancel out when forming the ratio and are included to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is approximately 90° for both planets, meaning `sin(i)` ≈ 1. Without this information, the problem would be unsolvable as the inclination angles would be unknown.\n3.  **Handling Indices Correctly**: The derivation requires careful tracking of the subscripts (1 and 2). Note how the final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}) (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})$, contains an inverted mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature and velocity ratios. Mistaking this inversion is a common pitfall that would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to recognize that since the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity in m/s is necessary.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic relationships first. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation much more direct and less prone to arithmetic error.\n\nMatching the calculated value of ~0.536 to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The variation in the final letter choices is an artifact of the agents working with different multiple-choice option lists. The numerical result is consistently and robustly calculated to be ~0.536.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, the star's properties ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) are constant and cancel out in the ratio. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$), so the albedo term also cancels. This leaves a simple relationship based only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet's orbit:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) data allows us to determine the semi-major axis ratio. For a planet of mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit around a much more massive star, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nRearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Simplify**\nWe can now form the ratio for the two semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\nSubstitute this expression back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Apply Final Conditions and Calculate**\nThe problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is a crucial piece of information, as it tells us the orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination for both planets is $i \\approx 90°$. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term becomes 1.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Thus, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final formula becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal: $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The question provides several data points that are not required for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These values all cancel out when forming ratios and are included to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This information is vital. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination `i` for both planets is ~90°, allowing the `sin(i)` term in the full radial velocity formula to be assumed to be 1 and to cancel from the ratio.\n3.  **Correctly Handling Ratios**: It is essential to track the indices (1 and 2) correctly throughout the derivation. Note the final formula has the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (inverted relative to the temperature indices) and the velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted). A common mistake is to flip one of these ratios, which would lead to incorrect distractor answers like ~1.05.\n4.  **Elegant Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by working with proportionalities and ratios from the beginning. A key algebraic insight is the cancellation of the square root from the temperature formula with the squared terms from the radial velocity formula, leading to a simple linear relationship.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: One must recognize that since the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratio is identical.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are an artifact of the agents working with different, randomized option lists. The scientific reasoning is consistently sound across all detailed explanations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. This leaves a much simpler relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, this relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a` yields:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Apply Problem-Specific Simplifications**\nSubstitute the expression for `a` into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\nAt this stage, we apply two critical pieces of information:\n*   **Transit Method**: The problem states the planets were detected via the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term $\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$ equals 1.\n*   **Doppler Shift**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).

It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity equations by making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n3.  **The Power of Ratios**: The problem is most easily and elegantly solved by working with ratios and proportionalities from the start. This approach allows for the immediate cancellation of physical constants ($G$) and fixed system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $A$, etc.).\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to absolute velocities is required.\n5.  **Index Tracking**: Careful algebraic derivation is necessary to arrive at the final formula `T_eq1/T_eq2 = (M_p2/M_p1) * (K_1/K_2)`. Note the inversion in the mass ratio term (`2/1`) relative to the temperature (`1/2`) and velocity (`1/2`) ratios. A mistake here could lead to one of the distractor answers (e.g., 1.05 or the inverse, ~1.87).\n6.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The perfect cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation less complex and reduces the chance of arithmetic error.\n\nMatching the calculated value of **~0.536** to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a unanimous consensus in the provided analyses, the problem is solved by deriving a relationship between the planets' equilibrium temperatures and the observational data from the radial velocity method. The derivation, final calculation, and key considerations are outlined below.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$). The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, we can cancel terms that are identical for both. Since they orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star is related to its semi-major axis $a$. For a circular orbit, this relationship can be expressed as:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Rearranging to solve for $a$, we get:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine and Further Simplify Using Problem Details**\n\nWe can now express the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\nNow we substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe crucial information here is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This means their orbits are seen edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i$ is ~90° for both planets, making $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term therefore cancels out, leaving the final, simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. This means the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe ratio is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The question provides a significant amount of data that is not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the [OI] line). This information is irrelevant because it cancels out when forming the required ratios, serving as a common distracter in physics problems.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is essential. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination ($i$) for both planets is approximately 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this assumption, the problem would be unsolvable as the unknown inclinations would remain in the formula.\n3.  **Indices and Ratios**: Careful tracking of the indices (1 and 2) is critical. Note how the final formula for $T_1/T_2$ uses the mass ratio $M_2/M_1$ (inverted) and the velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted). A mistake in this step would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It's important to recognize that the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), eliminating the need to convert the wavelength shift into units of velocity (m/s).\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic expressions before substituting numerical values. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation straightforward.\n\nBased on the calculated value of ~0.536, we can select the closest option from the list provided in the question.\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated result is unambiguously closest to ~ 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result. The discrepancies in the selected multiple-choice letters are clearly an artifact of the agents being presented with randomized option lists. The scientific reasoning is consistent and sound across all detailed explanations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Goal and Simplify the Temperature Ratio**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is identical for both), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. This leaves a much simpler relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial step reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet with mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) it induces on the star follows the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nHere, `i` is the orbital inclination. The problem states that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This is a vital clue, as it implies the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets. The relationship thus simplifies to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nRearranging this to solve for `a`, we find:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Calculation**\nFirst, we establish the ratio of the semi-major axes using the proportionality from Step 2:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel out perfectly, leading to the final, elegant formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Compute the Result**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct proxy for the ratio of the velocities.\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\nPlugging these values into our final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem is intentionally loaded with information that is not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the spectral line). Recognizing that these values cancel out when forming a ratio is a key part of solving the problem efficiently and correctly.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplification is necessary to solve the problem without having unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Index Management**: It is vital to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2) correctly throughout the derivation. Note that the final formula for the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on the *inverse* mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) but the *direct* velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Confusing these ratios is a common pitfall that leads to one of the incorrect distractor answers (1.05).\n4.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic expressions first. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a particularly important step that simplifies the final calculation.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to understand that the given maximum Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to absolute velocity in m/s is needed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe calculated numerical ratio of the equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$) is approximately **0.536**.

The only discrepancies among the candidates are the lettered choices, which is a common artifact when agents are presented with randomized option lists.\n\nThe following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's effective temperature and radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n    The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms are constant for both planets and cancel out in the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n    The semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the provided RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). The relationship, taking into account orbital inclination ($i$), is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    A critical piece of information is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Thus, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ and the term can be ignored for the ratio.\n\n    We can rearrange the simplified proportionality ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for the semi-major axis:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas to Find the Final Temperature Ratio**\n    First, use the proportionality from Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple and elegant final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n    Now, we plug in the values from the problem statement:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These values cancel out when calculating a ratio and are included to test a conceptual understanding of the relevant physics.\n*   **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This phrase is a critical clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity formula by allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1. Without this information, the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **Index Management**: Careful derivation is necessary to arrive at the correct final formula, which has mixed indices: $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$. Mistakenly inverting one of the ratios on the right side is a common error that leads to incorrect distractor answers.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), eliminating the need to convert the wavelength shifts into actual velocities (m/s).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic formulas using ratios and proportionalities first.

The variance in the letter choices from the candidate agents is due to them receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options, but the core calculation is universally consistent and correct.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's effective temperature and radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and will cancel out in the ratio. The formula simplifies greatly to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star in a circular orbit is given by a relationship that can be expressed as the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were detected via the **transit method**. This implies that we view their orbits edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets.\n\nThe proportionality simplifies to $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Final Expression**\nFirst, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$, using the proportionality from Step 2. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4.

These values are included as distractors; a key part of solving this problem is recognizing that these terms cancel out when forming the ratios.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This phrase is essential. It allows us to assume the orbital inclinations are both approximately 90° ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$), meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplifies the radial velocity formula and makes the problem solvable without unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Handling Subscripts**: The derivation requires careful tracking of the subscripts (1 and 2). Note how the final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$, involves an inversion in the mass ratio term ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature ratio, but not in the velocity term. Mixing these up is a common mistake that leads to incorrect answers.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that because the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratio is identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to calculate the actual velocities.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the equations algebraically *before* plugging in numbers.

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical) and have the same albedo ($A$ is identical), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial simplification reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is proportional to its mass ($M_p$) and inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nRearranging this to solve for `a` gives:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\nWe can now form the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas and Apply Problem-Specific Details**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\nAt this point, we apply two key pieces of information from the problem:\n*   The planets were detected via the **transit method**, which means their orbits are seen edge-on. Therefore, the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term becomes 1 and can be disregarded.\n*   The RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift `Δλ`. Therefore, their ratio is identical: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final, simplified formula is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to **~ 0.53**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides a large amount of data that is not needed for the calculation (Star's M, R, Teff; Planets' R; the rest wavelength of the [OI] line). Recognizing that these variables cancel out when forming a ratio is a key part of solving the problem correctly and efficiently.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclinations are $i \\approx 90°$, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets. Without this, the problem would be unsolvable due to the unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Correct Index Tracking**: The derivation results in the final formula $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$. Note the inversion of indices in the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature ratio ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$). Mistaking this (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer, such as ~1.05, which is present as a distractor option.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: A key insight is that the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the maximum Doppler wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), eliminating the need to convert units.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The solution is greatly streamlined by the cancellation of the square root with the squared terms during the derivation. This not only simplifies the final calculation but also reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and mathematical derivation required to solve the problem. The discrepancy in the final letter choices is an artifact of the agents working with randomized multiple-choice option lists. The underlying scientific reasoning and the final numerical result are consistently and robustly determined.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe goal is to determine the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to a relationship dependent only on the semi-major axes ($a_1, a_2$):\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were also detected via the *transit method*. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both. We can therefore safely ignore the $\\sin(i)$ term. Rearranging the simplified proportionality to solve for `a` gives:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine the Ratios**\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, yielding the final, elegant formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We plug in the values given in the question:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nThe calculated value is $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These are common distractors in physics problems to test the conceptual understanding of which variables cancel out in a ratio.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this piece of information, the problem would be unsolvable due to the unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Handling Ratios and Indices**: It is critical to keep the subscripts (1 and 2) correct throughout the derivation. A common pitfall is to incorrectly flip a ratio. Note that the final expression, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$, involves an inverted mass ratio relative to the temperature ratio. Accidentally using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ would lead to the distractor answer of 1.05.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that the ratio of Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$) can be used directly as a proxy for the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1 / K_2$), as the two are directly proportional.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the equations algebraically *before* plugging in numbers. The cancellation of the square root and the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation straightforward.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The discrepancies in the letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options, not any error in the physics.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**1. Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star, their $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ values are identical. The problem also states they have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star by a planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nHere, a crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This implies that we view their orbits edge-on, meaning the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The relationship simplifies to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nRearranging to solve for the semi-major axis $a$, we get:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Final Expression**\nFirst, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nNow, substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\nThe square root and the squares cancel perfectly, yielding a very simple final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the values from the problem:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides a lot of data that is not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii). This is a common feature in physics problems to test the conceptual understanding that for ratios, many system-wide parameters cancel out.\n2.  **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclinations are $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which allows the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1 and simplifies the RV formula. Without this, the inclinations would be unknown variables.\n3.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: One must recognize that the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to calculate the actual velocities in m/s.\n4.  **Index Tracking**: It is vital to track the subscripts correctly throughout the derivation. A common mistake would be to flip a ratio. For example, incorrectly using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ instead of $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ would lead to the result $(7/5) \\times (3/4) = 21/20 = 1.05$, which is intentionally provided as a distractor option (A).\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the equations algebraically *before* plugging in numbers.

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This is a critical first step, reducing the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) a planet induces on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}} $$\n    Here, $i$ is the orbital inclination. We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2} $$\n    Now we can form the ratio for the two planets:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas and Apply Key Information**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    Now, two crucial points come into play:\n    *   The planets were detected via the **transit method**, which means their orbits are edge-on, so $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the sine term cancels out.\n    *   The Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$). This means their ratio is identical: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n    This leaves the final, simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Plug in the values given in the problem:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The question provides a significant amount of data that is irrelevant to the final calculation (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii; the rest wavelength of the spectral line). These values all cancel out when calculating a ratio, and they serve as distractors to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This is not a throwaway detail. It is the critical piece of information that justifies assuming the orbital inclinations ($i$) for both planets are ~90°, allowing the `sin(i)` term in the radial velocity formula to be set to 1 and removed from the ratio.\n3.  **Careful Index Tracking**: It is essential to correctly track the subscripts (1 and 2) throughout the derivation. Note how the final formula for $T_1/T_2$ uses the mass ratio $M_2/M_1$ (inverted) and the velocity/shift ratio $K_1/K_2$ or $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$ (not inverted). A mix-up would lead to an incorrect answer, likely one of the other options.\n4.  **Proportionality and Simplification**: The most robust way to solve this problem is by using proportionalities and simplifying the algebraic expression *before* plugging in any numbers. This minimizes calculation errors and reveals the elegant final relationship. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that you don't need to convert the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) into a velocity in m/s ($K$). Since they are directly proportional, their ratio is the same, and you can use the shift values directly in the formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final calculation robustly yields a numerical result of approximately **0.536**.

Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe goal is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these common terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio.

Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). This relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. A crucial piece of information is that the planets were also detected by the **transit method**, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. We can therefore assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the simplified proportionality ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n$$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Temperature Ratio**\nFirst, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\nNext, we substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out perfectly, leading to the final, elegant formula:\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct substitute for the ratio of the K-velocities ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\nWe plug in the values from the question:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n**5.

These are common in physics problems to test the conceptual understanding of which variables cancel out in a ratio.\n2.  **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This information is a critical clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination ($i$) is approximately 90° for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity formula by allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1.\n3.  **Correct Index Tracking**: A careful derivation is essential to ensure the indices (1 and 2) are correct in the final formula. The temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) ends up depending on the mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). An error in one of these indices, such as flipping the mass ratio, would lead to an incorrect answer like 1.05, which is deliberately included as a distractor option.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that because the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to perform any intermediate calculations involving the speed of light.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the proportionalities algebraically first.

The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are an artifact of the agents being presented with randomized option lists, not errors in their scientific reasoning.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating the critical thinking points identified across the candidate responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n    The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. As both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these common terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n    The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the proportionality is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    A key detail in the problem is that the planets were also detected by the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets.\n\n    The simplified relationship becomes $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging this to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Calculation**\n    First, use the proportionality from Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, yielding the simple, final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, their ratio is identical: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\nThe result is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem is intentionally filled with data that is not required for the final calculation (the star's absolute mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line at 6300 Å).

The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n    The task is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's temperature ($T_{star}$) and radius ($R_{star}$) are the same for both. The problem also states that the planets have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, all these common terms cancel out when forming the ratio, leaving a simplified relationship based only on the semi-major axis:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This critical first step reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n    The semi-major axis can be related to the observed data using the radial velocity method. The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star is related to the semi-major axis $a$ by the following proportionality for a circular orbit:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    A crucial detail is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ for both planets. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ and can be omitted from the proportionality.\n\n    Rearranging the simplified relation ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for the semi-major axis $a$ gives:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas to Derive the Final Expression**\n    First, use the relationship from Step 2 to establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out perfectly, leading to the simple and elegant final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). This means the ratio of velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n    We can now plug in the values from the problem statement:\n    *   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n    This result is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The question provides a large amount of information that is not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the forbidden line). This is a common feature in physics problems to test a student's conceptual understanding of which variables are relevant and which cancel out in a ratio.\n*   **The \"Transit Method\" Clue**: This is not a throwaway detail; it is critical.

Define the Goal and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these terms, along with the constant '2', cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to a relationship dependent only on the planets' semi-major axes ($a$):\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now to find the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). The proportionality is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nA crucial clue is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**.

Combine Formulas and Derive the Final Expression**\n\nFirst, we establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple, elegant final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).

Note that the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on an inverted mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and a non-inverted velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Mistaking the mass ratio for $M_1/M_2$ would lead to the incorrect answer of ~1.05.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity (in m/s) is necessary.\n*   **Elegant Simplification**: A key part of the solution is the algebraic step where the square root in the temperature ratio formula cancels with the squared terms in the semi-major axis ratio formula.

The relationship simplifies to $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Formula**\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the proportionality from Step 2:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel perfectly, leaving a simple and elegant final expression:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nWe plug in the values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nThe calculation gives a numerical result of $15/28 \\approx 0.5357$. This value is closest to **0.53**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the spectral line). These values all cancel out when forming the ratio and are included to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is approximately 90° for both planets, meaning `sin(i)` ≈ 1. Without this information, the problem would be unsolvable as the inclination angles would be unknown.\n3.  **Handling Indices Correctly**: The derivation requires careful tracking of the subscripts (1 and 2). Note how the final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}) (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})$, contains an inverted mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature and velocity ratios. Mistaking this inversion is a common pitfall that would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to recognize that since the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to velocity in m/s is necessary.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic relationships first. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation much more direct and less prone to arithmetic error.\n\nMatching the calculated value of ~0.536 to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe result is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem.

The numerical result is consistently and robustly calculated to be ~0.536.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, the star's properties ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) are constant and cancel out in the ratio. The problem also states they have the same albedo ($A$), so the albedo term also cancels. This leaves a simple relationship based only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet's orbit:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) data allows us to determine the semi-major axis ratio. For a planet of mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit around a much more massive star, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nRearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Simplify**\nWe can now form the ratio for the two semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\nSubstitute this expression back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Apply Final Conditions and Calculate**\nThe problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**. This is a crucial piece of information, as it tells us the orbits are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination for both planets is $i \\approx 90°$. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term becomes 1.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Thus, the ratio of velocities $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio of Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final formula becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this to a decimal: $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The question provides several data points that are not required for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These values all cancel out when forming ratios and are included to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This information is vital. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination `i` for both planets is ~90°, allowing the `sin(i)` term in the full radial velocity formula to be assumed to be 1 and to cancel from the ratio.\n3.  **Correctly Handling Ratios**: It is essential to track the indices (1 and 2) correctly throughout the derivation. Note the final formula has the mass ratio $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ (inverted relative to the temperature indices) and the velocity ratio $K_1/K_2$ (not inverted). A common mistake is to flip one of these ratios, which would lead to incorrect distractor answers like ~1.05.\n4.  **Elegant Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by working with proportionalities and ratios from the beginning. A key algebraic insight is the cancellation of the square root from the temperature formula with the squared terms from the radial velocity formula, leading to a simple linear relationship.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: One must recognize that since the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratio is identical. There is no need to perform any unit conversions or calculate the actual velocity in m/s.\n\nThe calculated numerical result is ~0.536.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are an artifact of the agents working with different, randomized option lists. The scientific reasoning is consistently sound across all detailed explanations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio. This leaves a much simpler relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star. For a circular orbit, this relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a` yields:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios and Apply Problem-Specific Simplifications**\nSubstitute the expression for `a` into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)$\n\nAt this stage, we apply two critical pieces of information:\n*   **Transit Method**: The problem states the planets were detected via the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the inclination term $\\sin(i_2)/\\sin(i_1)$ equals 1.\n*   **Doppler Shift**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Thus, their ratios are identical: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final, simplified formula for the temperature ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**4.

Recognizing that these values cancel out when forming a ratio is a key part of understanding the underlying physics and solving the problem efficiently.\n2.  **The \"Transit Method\" Clue**: This is a critical detail. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90°$ for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity equations by making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n3.  **The Power of Ratios**: The problem is most easily and elegantly solved by working with ratios and proportionalities from the start. This approach allows for the immediate cancellation of physical constants ($G$) and fixed system parameters ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $A$, etc.).\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that since the Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). No conversion to absolute velocities is required.\n5.  **Index Tracking**: Careful algebraic derivation is necessary to arrive at the final formula `T_eq1/T_eq2 = (M_p2/M_p1) * (K_1/K_2)`. Note the inversion in the mass ratio term (`2/1`) relative to the temperature (`1/2`) and velocity (`1/2`) ratios. A mistake here could lead to one of the distractor answers (e.g., 1.05 or the inverse, ~1.87).\n6.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The perfect cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation less complex and reduces the chance of arithmetic error.\n\nMatching the calculated value of **~0.536** to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result is closest to **0.53**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a unanimous consensus in the provided analyses, the problem is solved by deriving a relationship between the planets' equilibrium temperatures and the observational data from the radial velocity method. The derivation, final calculation, and key considerations are outlined below.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$). The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nTo find the ratio for the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$, we can cancel terms that are identical for both. Since they orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star is related to its semi-major axis $a$. For a circular orbit, this relationship can be expressed as:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Rearranging to solve for $a$, we get:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine and Further Simplify Using Problem Details**\n\nWe can now express the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}$\n\nNow we substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe crucial information here is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This means their orbits are seen edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i$ is ~90° for both planets, making $\\sin(i_1) \\approx 1$ and $\\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term therefore cancels out, leaving the final, simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.

This information is irrelevant because it cancels out when forming the required ratios, serving as a common distracter in physics problems.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is essential. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination ($i$) for both planets is approximately 90°, meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Without this assumption, the problem would be unsolvable as the unknown inclinations would remain in the formula.\n3.  **Indices and Ratios**: Careful tracking of the indices (1 and 2) is critical.

The scientific reasoning is consistent and sound across all detailed explanations.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Goal and Simplify the Temperature Ratio**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is identical for both), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio. This leaves a much simpler relationship dependent only on the semi-major axis ($a$) of each planet:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial step reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet with mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) it induces on the star follows the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nHere, `i` is the orbital inclination. The problem states that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This is a vital clue, as it implies the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets. The relationship thus simplifies to:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nRearranging this to solve for `a`, we find:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Ratios for the Final Calculation**\nFirst, we establish the ratio of the semi-major axes using the proportionality from Step 2:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel out perfectly, leading to the final, elegant formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Compute the Result**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct proxy for the ratio of the velocities.\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\nPlugging these values into our final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem is intentionally loaded with information that is not needed for the calculation (the star's mass, radius, temperature; the planets' radii; the specific wavelength of the spectral line). Recognizing that these values cancel out when forming a ratio is a key part of solving the problem efficiently and correctly.\n2.  **Importance of \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies assuming that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplification is necessary to solve the problem without having unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Index Management**: It is vital to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2) correctly throughout the derivation. Note that the final formula for the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) depends on the *inverse* mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) but the *direct* velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). Confusing these ratios is a common pitfall that leads to one of the incorrect distractor answers (1.05).\n4.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic expressions first. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a particularly important step that simplifies the final calculation.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to understand that the given maximum Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).

Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms are constant for both planets and cancel out in the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n    The semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the provided RV data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on the star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). The relationship, taking into account orbital inclination ($i$), is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n    A critical piece of information is that the planets were also detected via the **transit method**. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets. Thus, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ and the term can be ignored for the ratio.\n\n    We can rearrange the simplified proportionality ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for the semi-major axis:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas to Find the Final Temperature Ratio**\n    First, use the proportionality from Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel each other perfectly, leaving a simple and elegant final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\n    Now, we plug in the values from the problem statement:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many details that are not needed for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line wavelength). These values cancel out when calculating a ratio and are included to test a conceptual understanding of the relevant physics.\n*   **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This phrase is a critical clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity formula by allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1. Without this information, the problem would be unsolvable.\n*   **Index Management**: Careful derivation is necessary to arrive at the correct final formula, which has mixed indices: $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$. Mistakenly inverting one of the ratios on the right side is a common error that leads to incorrect distractor answers.\n*   **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that the ratio of RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), eliminating the need to convert the wavelength shifts into actual velocities (m/s).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the algebraic formulas using ratios and proportionalities first. The cancellation of the square root and squares is a key simplification that makes the final calculation straightforward.\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The variance in the letter choices from the candidate agents is due to them receiving differently ordered multiple-choice options, but the core calculation is universally consistent and correct.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's effective temperature and radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and will cancel out in the ratio. The formula simplifies greatly to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star in a circular orbit is given by a relationship that can be expressed as the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were detected via the **transit method**. This implies that we view their orbits edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°. Therefore, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets.\n\nThe proportionality simplifies to $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Final Expression**\nFirst, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$, using the proportionality from Step 2. The constants of proportionality cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out, leading to the elegant final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is identical to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$. We can now plug in the values from the problem:\n\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nThe final numerical value is approximately 0.5357.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides a large amount of information that is not required for the final calculation (the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature; the planets' radii; the rest wavelength of the spectral line). These values are included as distractors; a key part of solving this problem is recognizing that these terms cancel out when forming the ratios.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This phrase is essential. It allows us to assume the orbital inclinations are both approximately 90° ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$), meaning $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. This simplifies the radial velocity formula and makes the problem solvable without unknown inclination angles.\n3.  **Handling Subscripts**: The derivation requires careful tracking of the subscripts (1 and 2). Note how the final formula, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$, involves an inversion in the mass ratio term ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature ratio, but not in the velocity term. Mixing these up is a common mistake that leads to incorrect answers.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that because the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), their ratio is identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to calculate the actual velocities.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the equations algebraically *before* plugging in numbers. The cancellation of the square root with the squares is a key simplification that makes the final calculation much more straightforward.\n\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is ~0.536.

The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physical principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancies are in matching the result to a multiple-choice letter, which is an artifact of shuffled option lists.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is its albedo. We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical) and have the same albedo ($A$ is identical), these terms cancel out when forming the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis crucial simplification reduces the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is proportional to its mass ($M_p$) and inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nRearranging this to solve for `a` gives:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n\nWe can now form the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right)^2$\n\n**3.

Therefore, the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°, so $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$. The inclination term becomes 1 and can be disregarded.\n*   The RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift `Δλ`. Therefore, their ratio is identical: $K_1 / K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nThe final, simplified formula is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n**4.

Note the inversion of indices in the mass ratio ($M_{p2}/M_{p1}$) relative to the temperature ratio ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$). Mistaking this (e.g., using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$) would lead to an incorrect answer, such as ~1.05, which is present as a distractor option.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: A key insight is that the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is identical to the ratio of the maximum Doppler wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), eliminating the need to convert units.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The solution is greatly streamlined by the cancellation of the square root with the squared terms during the derivation.

The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A$ is the same), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to a relationship dependent only on the semi-major axes ($a_1, a_2$):\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV method provides the link to the orbital distance. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) it induces on its star is related to its mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both planets were also detected via the *transit method*. This implies that their orbits are viewed edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both. We can therefore safely ignore the $\\sin(i)$ term. Rearranging the simplified proportionality to solve for `a` gives:\n$a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**3.

Since both planets orbit the same star, their $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ values are identical. The problem also states they have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming a ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the inverse ratio of the planets' orbital distances (semi-major axes, $a$).\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star by a planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nHere, a crucial piece of information is that the planets were detected by the **transit method**.

This is a common feature in physics problems to test the conceptual understanding that for ratios, many system-wide parameters cancel out.\n2.  **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This detail is crucial. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclinations are $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which allows the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1 and simplifies the RV formula. Without this, the inclinations would be unknown variables.\n3.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: One must recognize that the maximum Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), so their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to calculate the actual velocities in m/s.\n4.  **Index Tracking**: It is vital to track the subscripts correctly throughout the derivation. A common mistake would be to flip a ratio. For example, incorrectly using $M_{p1}/M_{p2}$ instead of $M_{p2}/M_{p1}$ would lead to the result $(7/5) \\times (3/4) = 21/20 = 1.05$, which is intentionally provided as a distractor option (A).\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the equations algebraically *before* plugging in numbers. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification that makes the final calculation straightforward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536.

The discrepancy in the final letter choices is an artifact of shuffled multiple-choice options, but the numerical result is consistent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n    The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This is a critical first step, reducing the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) a planet induces on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, this can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}} $$\n    Here, $i$ is the orbital inclination. We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2} $$\n    Now we can form the ratio for the two planets:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas and Apply Key Information**\n    Substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2) / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1) / K_1^2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sin(i_2)}{\\sin(i_1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n    Now, two crucial points come into play:\n    *   The planets were detected via the **transit method**, which means their orbits are edge-on, so $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90°$. Therefore, $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2) \\approx 1$, and the sine term cancels out.\n    *   The Doppler shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude ($K$). This means their ratio is identical: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\n    This leaves the final, simplified formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Plug in the values given in the problem:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The question provides a significant amount of data that is irrelevant to the final calculation (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii; the rest wavelength of the spectral line). These values all cancel out when calculating a ratio, and they serve as distractors to test conceptual understanding.\n2.  **Importance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This is not a throwaway detail. It is the critical piece of information that justifies assuming the orbital inclinations ($i$) for both planets are ~90°, allowing the `sin(i)` term in the radial velocity formula to be set to 1 and removed from the ratio.\n3.  **Careful Index Tracking**: It is essential to correctly track the subscripts (1 and 2) throughout the derivation. Note how the final formula for $T_1/T_2$ uses the mass ratio $M_2/M_1$ (inverted) and the velocity/shift ratio $K_1/K_2$ or $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$ (not inverted). A mix-up would lead to an incorrect answer, likely one of the other options.\n4.  **Proportionality and Simplification**: The most robust way to solve this problem is by using proportionalities and simplifying the algebraic expression *before* plugging in any numbers. This minimizes calculation errors and reveals the elegant final relationship. The cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key simplification.\n5.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy**: It is important to recognize that you don't need to convert the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) into a velocity in m/s ($K$). Since they are directly proportional, their ratio is the same, and you can use the shift values directly in the formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final calculation robustly yields a numerical result of approximately **0.536**.

The different letter answers selected by the agents are a clear artifact of them being presented with randomized multiple-choice options. The numerical result of the calculation is consistently and robustly determined across all analyses.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe goal is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo ($A$), these common terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out when forming the ratio. The formula simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes ($a$).\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and semi-major axis ($a$). This relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n$K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. A crucial piece of information is that the planets were also detected by the **transit method**, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. We can therefore assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ for both, making $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the simplified proportionality ($K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$) to solve for the semi-major axis gives:\n$$ a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2} $$\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Temperature Ratio**\nFirst, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\nNext, we substitute this expression back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\nThe square root and the squares cancel each other out perfectly, leading to the final, elegant formula:\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n**4. Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, we can use the ratio of the Doppler shifts as a direct substitute for the ratio of the K-velocities ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n\nWe plug in the values from the question:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\n$$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\n\n**5. Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated numerical value is approximately **0.536**. Comparing this to the multiple-choice options provided:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is unambiguously closest to 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The problem provides many numerical details that are not required for the final calculation, such as the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. These are common in physics problems to test the conceptual understanding of which variables cancel out in a ratio.\n2.  **Significance of the \"Transit Method\"**: This information is a critical clue. It justifies the assumption that the orbital inclination ($i$) is approximately 90° for both planets, which simplifies the radial velocity formula by allowing the $\\sin(i)$ term to be treated as 1.\n3.  **Correct Index Tracking**: A careful derivation is essential to ensure the indices (1 and 2) are correct in the final formula. The temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) ends up depending on the mass ratio ($M_2/M_1$) and the velocity ratio ($K_1/K_2$). An error in one of these indices, such as flipping the mass ratio, would lead to an incorrect answer like 1.05, which is deliberately included as a distractor option.\n4.  **Doppler Shift as a Proxy for Velocity**: It is important to understand that because the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), their ratios are identical ($K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$). There is no need to perform any intermediate calculations involving the speed of light.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem is most easily solved by simplifying the proportionalities algebraically first. The elegant cancellation of the square root with the squared terms is a key feature that simplifies the final calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required for a solution. All agents who showed their work arrived at the same numerical result, confirming the robustness of the derivation. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are an artifact of the agents being presented with randomized option lists, not errors in their scientific reasoning.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating the critical thinking points identified across the candidate responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Formulate and Simplify the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n    The question asks for the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. As both planets orbit the same star (constant $T_{star}, R_{star}$) and have the same albedo (constant $A$), these common terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} $$\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n    The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on a star by an orbiting planet is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the proportionality is:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    A key detail in the problem is that the planets were also detected by the **transit method**. This implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$ for both planets.\n\n    The simplified relationship becomes $K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$. Rearranging this to solve for `a` gives:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas for the Final Calculation**\n    First, use the proportionality from Step 2 to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $$ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2 $$\n    Next, substitute this expression for $a_2/a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} $$\n    The square root and the squares cancel out, yielding the simple, final formula:\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the maximum measured Doppler wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, their ratio is identical: $K_1/K_2 = \\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n    We plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $$ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} $$\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    $$ \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357 $$\nThe result is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem is intentionally filled with data that is not required for the final calculation (the star's absolute mass, radius, and temperature; the planets' radii; the specific spectral line at 6300 Å). Recognizing that these values cancel out when forming ratios is a key part of understanding the underlying physics.\n*   **The \"Transit Method\" Clue**: This is a vital piece of information, not a distractor. It justifies assuming the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, which simplifies the RV formula by allowing us to take $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Index Tracking**: It is crucial to correctly track the subscripts (1 and 2) through the algebraic derivation. The final formula has mixed indices: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$ but $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$. Accidentally inverting one of these ratios is a common pitfall that leads to incorrect distractor answers.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification**: The problem's structure allows for a very elegant simplification where the square root in the temperature formula cancels out the squared terms from the RV formula. Solving the problem algebraically with ratios from the start is more efficient and less error-prone than calculating intermediate values for `a` or `K`.\n*   **Doppler Shift as Proxy**: One must understand that since $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio of velocities ($K_1/K_2$) is the same as the ratio of wavelength shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).
