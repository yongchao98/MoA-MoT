Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this fifth degree of unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This leads to a working hypothesis of a substituted benzene ring containing a carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its specific frequency is crucial.\n*   **Careful Points**:\n    1.  The presence of *two* N-H bands strongly supports a primary amine (-NH₂) over a secondary amine or amide (-NH-), which would show only one peak. This helps to rule out **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n    2.  The C=O frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This helps to rule out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **Careful Points**:\n    1.  The **para-substitution pattern** (two doublets) definitively rules out the meta-substituted isomer, **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n    2.  The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    3.  This shift value allows for the definitive rejection of the isomer **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**. In this molecule (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet for the ethyl group would be next to the carbonyl carbon, causing it to appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), which contradicts the observed value of 4.5 ppm.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nAll spectroscopic data converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers and a direct analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be unambiguously identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly correct, leading to the same chemical conclusion; the differences in their final letter choices are an artifact of the option lists being randomized for each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis with key \"careful points\" highlighted:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point:** The DoU calculation is the foundational first step. It immediately frames the problem as identifying an aromatic compound containing a C=O double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* distinct peaks for N-H stretching is critical. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This fact alone rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this peak is key to distinguishing functional groups. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (< 1700 cm⁻¹). This rules out amide structures like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The clear `para` substitution pattern (two symmetrical doublets) definitively rules out any `meta` or `ortho` substitution patterns, which would be more complex. This provides a second strong argument against the meta-substituted **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet coupled to a quartet.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of information in the entire puzzle. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This decisively rules out the isomeric structure **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the CH₂ group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which corroborates the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Evaluation**\nCombining all the evidence:\n1.  The structure has a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n2.  The structure has an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** group.\n3.  These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para)** arrangement.\n\nThe only molecule that satisfies all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect isomer.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct**.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect functional group and substitution pattern.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect functional group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **Key Peaks:** The two medium-to-strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern of two distinct N-H stretching bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This evidence immediately rules out option **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n\n*   **Key Peak:** The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its frequency is consistent with a conjugated **ester**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option A), which would generally absorb below 1700 cm⁻¹. This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide. This evidence rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\nWe are now left to decide between the two isomers: C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate and D) 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\n*   **Key Signals:** Two doublets in the aromatic region at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This confirms the substitution pattern and provides further evidence against option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted. Both remaining options, C and D, are para-substituted.\n\n*   **Key Signal:** A broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This signal is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), corroborating the IR data.\n\n*   **Key Signals:** A triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** and a quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This triplet-quartet pair clearly represents an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Most Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of information. A methylene group (-CH₂-) with a signal this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n    *   In **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, the structure is H₂N-Ph-CO**O-CH₂**CH₃. The methylene group is bonded to the ester oxygen, which matches the observed chemical shift of 4.5 ppm perfectly.\n    *   In **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, the structure is H₂N-Ph-O-**CO-CH₂**CH₃. Here, the methylene group is bonded to the carbonyl carbon. Its signal would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the experimental data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll spectroscopic evidence converges on a single structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals that all agents correctly deduced the chemical structure of the unknown compound through sound, consistent reasoning. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stems from the randomization of the option list presented to each agent, not from any disagreement in the scientific analysis. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis that highlights the key decision points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond. The presence of two oxygen atoms suggests this double bond is a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These signals are in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of **two** distinct bands is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This evidence is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only *one* band here. This immediately disfavors option **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like that in option A), which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide, effectively ruling out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern rules out the possibility of meta- or ortho-substitution, providing further evidence against the meta-substituted **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Evidence):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the fragment is an **ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This observation definitively distinguishes between the two remaining possibilities:\n        *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** (`H₂N-Ph-CO-O-CH₂CH₃`): This structure is a perfect match. The methylene group is attached to the ester oxygen and is expected to have a chemical shift of ~4.1-4.6 ppm.\n        *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate** (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`): This structure is inconsistent. Here, the methylene group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift much further upfield, around 2.2-2.5 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nEvery piece of spectral data, when carefully analyzed, converges on a single, unambiguous structure. The compound is a benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group substituted in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound, incorporating careful points to consider at each stage of the deduction.\n\n### **Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2), which for this molecule is DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the π-bonds). The fifth degree of unsaturation must come from another feature, which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These are two distinct, sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of **two** bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would only show a single band. This is a crucial piece of evidence that immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as `N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide`.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of the carbonyl stretch is key to identifying the functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ for a carbonyl conjugated with a benzene ring is characteristic of an **ester**. A conjugated amide, by contrast, would typically absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This evidence strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide like `3-ethoxybenzamide`.\n\n### **Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring leads to this simplified pattern. A meta- or ortho-substituted ring would show a more complex pattern. This allows us to rule out `3-ethoxybenzamide`, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair clearly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield is extremely deshielded, which occurs when it is directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group (**-CO-O-CH₂-**). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons. Consistent with our findings from the IR spectrum, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Final Structure and Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence collected points to one unambiguous structure:\n1.  A benzene ring that is **para-substituted** (from NMR).\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine, -NH₂** (from IR and NMR).\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃** (from IR and NMR). The `4.5 ppm` shift in the NMR specifically confirms the `-O-CH₂CH₃` connectivity, ruling out its isomer.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the provided options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). Critically, the quartet for its ethyl group's `-CH₂-` would be next to the carbonyl, causing its NMR signal to appear around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers and a systematic analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be conclusively identified. The reasoning across all candidate agents is uniformly sound; the variation in their final letter choices is merely an artifact of randomized option lists, not a disagreement in chemical analysis.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis, highlighting the most critical points of deduction:\n\n**Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This pair of distinct absorption bands is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NHR₂) or an amide would only show a single peak in this region. This evidence immediately rules out any option that is not a primary amine, such as **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would appear <1700 cm⁻¹), ruling out amide-containing options like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, form a classic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the definitive fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern confirms the substitution is on opposite ends of the ring, further ruling out the meta-substituted **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** A coupled triplet and quartet signify an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This fact allows for the crucial distinction between the two ester isomers:\n        *   **It confirms ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D)**, which has the H₂N-Ph-CO-**O-CH₂**-CH₃ structure.\n        *   **It decisively rules out 4-aminophenyl propionate (B)**, whose structure is H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**-CH₃. In this isomer, the quartet for the bolded -CH₂- group would appear much further upfield, at approximately 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nEvery piece of evidence converges to identify one unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1- and 4-positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The correct compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (Secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (Wrong ester isomer; NMR chemical shift mismatch).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (Meta-substituted amide).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of the compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring, which accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to an additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial piece of data. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This evidence immediately casts doubt on option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option A), which would typically appear below 1700 cm⁻¹. This suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This confirms the substitution pattern is *para*. This definitively rules out option A, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is *meta*-substituted.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Evidence):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure.

This allows us to distinguish between the two remaining possibilities:\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This contains the -CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃ fragment. The bolded -CH₂- is attached to an ester oxygen, which matches the observed 4.5 ppm chemical shift.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer has the structure H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. Here, the bolded -CH₂- group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.

The compound possesses a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only option that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous and correct chemical reasoning process. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are an artifact of the options being presented in a different random order to each agent. The step-by-step analysis below confirms the identity of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a molecule containing a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, which, given the oxygen atoms, is highly likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* N-H bands immediately rules out secondary amines/amides like **(D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**. The carbonyl frequency being characteristic of a conjugated ester, not an amide, rules out **(B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the exchangeable protons on a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the structure contains an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point is sufficient to distinguish between the correct answer and its isomer:\n    *   It matches **(A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which has the -CO-**O-CH₂**-CH₃ structure.\n    *   It decisively rules out **(C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, which has a -CO-**CH₂**-CH₃ structure. The quartet for this isomer would appear much further upfield, at approximately 2.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion: Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options\n\nAll the spectral data point to a single structure: a benzene ring with two substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂), and the other is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the options against this conclusion:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para).\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. It is an isomer, but its NMR quartet for the ethyl group would be at the wrong chemical shift (~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to definitively identify the unknown compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are a classic and unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only a single peak in this region. This evidence immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as option **(D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of the carbonyl stretch is crucial for identifying the functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated to an aromatic ring**. It is too high in frequency to be a typical conjugated amide (which appears <1700 cm⁻¹), ruling out option **(C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, create a symmetrical pattern.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern is the fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons). This rules out the meta-substituted isomer, option **(C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester and not a phenyl propionate. It definitively rules out isomer **(B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the -CH₂- group would be next to the carbonyl, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which corroborates the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Structure**\n\nAll spectral data converge on a single, unique structure:\n*   A **1,4-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   With a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   And an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nThe only compound that fits every piece of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches option A in the provided list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a systematic review of the spectral data and a synthesis of the sound reasoning presented by all candidate agents, the identity of the unknown compound can be conclusively determined. The chemical analysis is uniformly correct across all provided answers, with discrepancies in the final letter choice stemming from the randomization of the option lists presented to each agent, not from any error in interpretation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points crucial for the correct identification.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a highly unsaturated structure. It almost always signifies the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three internal double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which, given the oxygen atoms, is very likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: These two distinct, sharp bands are in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of **two** bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. A secondary amine (-NH-) or amide would only show a single peak in this region. This single piece of evidence definitively rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is key. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This frequency is significantly higher than that of a typical conjugated amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹), which rules out structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: Two doublets are observed in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This clean, symmetrical pattern is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This structural feature rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, providing further evidence against **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This triplet-quartet pair unmistakably identifies an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most powerful piece of evidence in the entire dataset for determining the exact isomer. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield (so highly deshielded) must be directly attached to a very electronegative atom. This confirms it is attached to the ester oxygen, indicating an **ethyl ester fragment (-COO-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point decisively rules out the isomeric structure **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the quartet (-CO-**CH₂**CH₃) would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon and thus appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This broad singlet integrates to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This peak represents the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂). Its presence corroborates the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Structure**\nEvery piece of spectroscopic evidence points to one and only one structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The correct IUPAC name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\nMatching the confirmed structure, **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, to the list of options provided in the question:\nA) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect. Ruled out by the NMR chemical shift of the ethyl quartet.\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. Ruled out by IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\nC) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct**. Matches all spectral data perfectly.\nD) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. Ruled out by IR (ester vs. amide) and NMR (para vs. meta substitution).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be unambiguously identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly sound, with discrepancies in the final letter choice stemming from randomized option lists, not from errors in chemical interpretation.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis incorporating all the key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional double bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ & 3325 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Two distinct, strong bands in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would only show a single peak. This crucial detail immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Analysis**: A strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency of this peak is key. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. A conjugated amide C=O stretch usually appears at a lower frequency (<1700 cm⁻¹), which makes amide structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide** unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the classic, unambiguous fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry rules out meta-substitution (as in **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**) and ortho-substitution, which would produce more complex patterns.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This signal is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, perfectly corroborating the IR evidence.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) & 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: A coupled triplet and quartet, indicating an ethyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point (Most Decisive Detail)**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most informative piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester **(-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This allows a definitive distinction between the remaining isomers:\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: The fragment is H₂N-Ph-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃. The methylene group is attached to the ester oxygen, which perfectly explains the 4.5 ppm chemical shift. **This matches the data.**\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: The fragment is H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. Here, the methylene group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. **This contradicts the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nEvery piece of spectral evidence converges on a single, unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided option list:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect. Contradicts the ¹H NMR chemical shift of the ethyl quartet.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, contradicting IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Incorrect. It is an amide and is meta-substituted, both contradicted by IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nA detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data is required to identify the correct structure. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is sound and demonstrates a clear consensus on the chemical identity of the compound, with discrepancies in the final letter choice stemming only from the randomization of the option lists.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and key decision points:\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThe molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one for the ring and three for the double bonds within it) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **IR peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The presence of **two** distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Its frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is too high to be a typical amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This makes **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide** an unlikely candidate.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the substitution pattern and rules out meta-substituted isomers like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Most Decisive):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield (deshielded) must be directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃). This observation allows us to distinguish between the final two options:\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-CO-O-CH₂CH₃. The quartet at ~4.5 ppm is expected for the bolded CH₂. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is an isomer, H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The quartet would correspond to the bolded CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, which would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the data.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nEvery piece of spectral data aligns perfectly to identify the compound as having a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group, with the ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen. This unique structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this structure to the provided options confirms that A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, supported by the unanimous chemical reasoning found in all the candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion about the structure of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this additional double bond is very likely part of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* peaks, not one, is crucial. It allows us to confidently identify a primary amine, ruling out structures with secondary amines or amides, such as `N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide`.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this peak is very informative. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (e.g., `3-ethoxybenzamide`), which would usually absorb below 1700 cm⁻¹. This suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern rules out any meta- (1,3) or ortho- (1,2) substituted isomers. Therefore, `3-ethoxybenzamide` can be eliminated on this basis as well.\n*   **Peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **Peaks at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair clearly represents an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Clue):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached directly to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This observation decisively rules out the isomeric `4-aminophenyl propionate`, where the methylene protons in its `-CO-CH₂CH₃` group would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the pieces of spectral evidence assemble into only one possible structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the options provided:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect, due to the NMR quartet chemical shift.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect, this is a secondary amide, not a primary amine/ester.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect, this is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous and correct chemical reasoning to identify the unknown compound. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the agents are an artifact of the option lists being randomized for each agent, not a disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one for the ring and three for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this fifth degree is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   These two distinct absorption bands are located in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* distinct peaks is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, arising from its symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one peak here. This evidence immediately rules out option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is critical. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated to an aromatic ring**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C), which would appear at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This points towards an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This symmetrical \"AA'BB'\" splitting pattern is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.

The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this correct identification to the provided options confirms the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The DoU is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional unsaturation is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1**:\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show a single peak. This fact immediately rules out any structures that do not contain a primary amine, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm-1**:\n    *   This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm-1). This evidence rules out amide structures like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Careful Point**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring. This confirms the substitution pattern and provides further evidence against the meta-substituted isomer, **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**:\n    *   This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   This key detail allows us to distinguish between the two remaining ester isomers. It confirms the structure is an ethyl ester and rules out **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate** (isomer: H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), where the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**:\n    *   A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, which corroborates the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge to identify a single, unique structure. The compound has a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH₂), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The structure is therefore **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (wrong isomer, wrong NMR shift).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (wrong functional group, wrong substitution).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (wrong functional group).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to definitively identify the unknown compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation**: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional unsaturation is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This establishes the basic framework as an aromatic carbonyl compound.\n\n### **2.

A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only a single peak. This key observation rules out option **(C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**.

The two sets of protons on opposite sides of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups split each other.

Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this fifth degree of unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This leads to a working hypothesis of a substituted benzene ring containing a carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its specific frequency is crucial.\n*   **Careful Points**:\n    1.  The presence of *two* N-H bands strongly supports a primary amine (-NH₂) over a secondary amine or amide (-NH-), which would show only one peak. This helps to rule out **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n    2.  The C=O frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This helps to rule out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **Careful Points**:\n    1.  The **para-substitution pattern** (two doublets) definitively rules out the meta-substituted isomer, **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n    2.  The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    3.  This shift value allows for the definitive rejection of the isomer **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**. In this molecule (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet for the ethyl group would be next to the carbonyl carbon, causing it to appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), which contradicts the observed value of 4.5 ppm.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nAll spectroscopic data converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers and a direct analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be unambiguously identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly correct, leading to the same chemical conclusion; the differences in their final letter choices are an artifact of the option lists being randomized for each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis with key \"careful points\" highlighted:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Careful Point:** The DoU calculation is the foundational first step. It immediately frames the problem as identifying an aromatic compound containing a C=O double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* distinct peaks for N-H stretching is critical. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This fact alone rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this peak is key to distinguishing functional groups. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (< 1700 cm⁻¹). This rules out amide structures like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The clear `para` substitution pattern (two symmetrical doublets) definitively rules out any `meta` or `ortho` substitution patterns, which would be more complex. This provides a second strong argument against the meta-substituted **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet coupled to a quartet.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of information in the entire puzzle. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This decisively rules out the isomeric structure **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the CH₂ group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which corroborates the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Evaluation**\nCombining all the evidence:\n1.  The structure has a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n2.  The structure has an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** group.\n3.  These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para)** arrangement.\n\nThe only molecule that satisfies all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect isomer.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - **Correct**.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect functional group and substitution pattern.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect functional group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **Key Peaks:** The two medium-to-strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern of two distinct N-H stretching bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This evidence immediately rules out option **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n\n*   **Key Peak:** The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This peak is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its frequency is consistent with a conjugated **ester**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option A), which would generally absorb below 1700 cm⁻¹. This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide. This evidence rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\nWe are now left to decide between the two isomers: C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate and D) 4-aminophenyl propionate.\n\n*   **Key Signals:** Two doublets in the aromatic region at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This pattern is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This confirms the substitution pattern and provides further evidence against option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted. Both remaining options, C and D, are para-substituted.\n\n*   **Key Signal:** A broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This signal is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), corroborating the IR data.\n\n*   **Key Signals:** A triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** and a quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)**.\n*   **Interpretation:** This triplet-quartet pair clearly represents an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Most Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of information. A methylene group (-CH₂-) with a signal this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n    *   In **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, the structure is H₂N-Ph-CO**O-CH₂**CH₃. The methylene group is bonded to the ester oxygen, which matches the observed chemical shift of 4.5 ppm perfectly.\n    *   In **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, the structure is H₂N-Ph-O-**CO-CH₂**CH₃. Here, the methylene group is bonded to the carbonyl carbon. Its signal would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the experimental data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll spectroscopic evidence converges on a single structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals that all agents correctly deduced the chemical structure of the unknown compound through sound, consistent reasoning. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) stems from the randomization of the option list presented to each agent, not from any disagreement in the scientific analysis. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis that highlights the key decision points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond. The presence of two oxygen atoms suggests this double bond is a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These signals are in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of **two** distinct bands is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This evidence is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only *one* band here. This immediately disfavors option **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like that in option A), which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide, effectively ruling out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern rules out the possibility of meta- or ortho-substitution, providing further evidence against the meta-substituted **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Interpretation:** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Evidence):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the fragment is an **ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This observation definitively distinguishes between the two remaining possibilities:\n        *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** (`H₂N-Ph-CO-O-CH₂CH₃`): This structure is a perfect match. The methylene group is attached to the ester oxygen and is expected to have a chemical shift of ~4.1-4.6 ppm.\n        *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate** (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`): This structure is inconsistent. Here, the methylene group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift much further upfield, around 2.2-2.5 ppm.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nEvery piece of spectral data, when carefully analyzed, converges on a single, unambiguous structure. The compound is a benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group substituted in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This matches option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound, incorporating careful points to consider at each stage of the deduction.\n\n### **Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2), which for this molecule is DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the π-bonds). The fifth degree of unsaturation must come from another feature, which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These are two distinct, sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of **two** bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would only show a single band. This is a crucial piece of evidence that immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as `N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide`.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of the carbonyl stretch is key to identifying the functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ for a carbonyl conjugated with a benzene ring is characteristic of an **ester**. A conjugated amide, by contrast, would typically absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This evidence strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide like `3-ethoxybenzamide`.\n\n### **Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring leads to this simplified pattern. A meta- or ortho-substituted ring would show a more complex pattern. This allows us to rule out `3-ethoxybenzamide`, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair clearly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield is extremely deshielded, which occurs when it is directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group (**-CO-O-CH₂-**). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of exchangeable protons. Consistent with our findings from the IR spectrum, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Final Structure and Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence collected points to one unambiguous structure:\n1.  A benzene ring that is **para-substituted** (from NMR).\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine, -NH₂** (from IR and NMR).\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃** (from IR and NMR). The `4.5 ppm` shift in the NMR specifically confirms the `-O-CH₂CH₃` connectivity, ruling out its isomer.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the provided options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). Critically, the quartet for its ethyl group's `-CH₂-` would be next to the carbonyl, causing its NMR signal to appear around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided candidate answers and a systematic analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be conclusively identified. The reasoning across all candidate agents is uniformly sound; the variation in their final letter choices is merely an artifact of randomized option lists, not a disagreement in chemical analysis.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis, highlighting the most critical points of deduction:\n\n**Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This pair of distinct absorption bands is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NHR₂) or an amide would only show a single peak in this region. This evidence immediately rules out any option that is not a primary amine, such as **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would appear <1700 cm⁻¹), ruling out amide-containing options like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, form a classic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the definitive fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern confirms the substitution is on opposite ends of the ring, further ruling out the meta-substituted **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** A coupled triplet and quartet signify an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This fact allows for the crucial distinction between the two ester isomers:\n        *   **It confirms ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D)**, which has the H₂N-Ph-CO-**O-CH₂**-CH₃ structure.\n        *   **It decisively rules out 4-aminophenyl propionate (B)**, whose structure is H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**-CH₃. In this isomer, the quartet for the bolded -CH₂- group would appear much further upfield, at approximately 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nEvery piece of evidence converges to identify one unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1- and 4-positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The correct compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (Secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (Wrong ester isomer; NMR chemical shift mismatch).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (Meta-substituted amide).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of the compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring, which accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to an additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial piece of data. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This evidence immediately casts doubt on option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option A), which would typically appear below 1700 cm⁻¹. This suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This confirms the substitution pattern is *para*. This definitively rules out option A, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is *meta*-substituted.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Evidence):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This allows us to distinguish between the two remaining possibilities:\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This contains the -CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃ fragment. The bolded -CH₂- is attached to an ester oxygen, which matches the observed 4.5 ppm chemical shift.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer has the structure H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. Here, the bolded -CH₂- group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the observed data.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), corroborating the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single, unambiguous structure. The compound possesses a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only option that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous and correct chemical reasoning process. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are an artifact of the options being presented in a different random order to each agent. The step-by-step analysis below confirms the identity of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a molecule containing a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, which, given the oxygen atoms, is highly likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* N-H bands immediately rules out secondary amines/amides like **(D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**. The carbonyl frequency being characteristic of a conjugated ester, not an amide, rules out **(B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the exchangeable protons on a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the structure contains an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point is sufficient to distinguish between the correct answer and its isomer:\n    *   It matches **(A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which has the -CO-**O-CH₂**-CH₃ structure.\n    *   It decisively rules out **(C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, which has a -CO-**CH₂**-CH₃ structure. The quartet for this isomer would appear much further upfield, at approximately 2.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion: Assembling the Pieces and Evaluating the Options\n\nAll the spectral data point to a single structure: a benzene ring with two substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂), and the other is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the options against this conclusion:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para).\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. It is an isomer, but its NMR quartet for the ethyl group would be at the wrong chemical shift (~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to definitively identify the unknown compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional unsaturation is most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are a classic and unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only a single peak in this region. This evidence immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines, such as option **(D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of the carbonyl stretch is crucial for identifying the functional group. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated to an aromatic ring**. It is too high in frequency to be a typical conjugated amide (which appears <1700 cm⁻¹), ruling out option **(C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, create a symmetrical pattern.\n*   **Careful Point:** This pattern is the fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons). This rules out the meta-substituted isomer, option **(C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester and not a phenyl propionate. It definitively rules out isomer **(B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the -CH₂- group would be next to the carbonyl, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which corroborates the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Structure**\n\nAll spectral data converge on a single, unique structure:\n*   A **1,4-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   With a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   And an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nThe only compound that fits every piece of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches option A in the provided list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a systematic review of the spectral data and a synthesis of the sound reasoning presented by all candidate agents, the identity of the unknown compound can be conclusively determined. The chemical analysis is uniformly correct across all provided answers, with discrepancies in the final letter choice stemming from the randomization of the option lists presented to each agent, not from any error in interpretation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points crucial for the correct identification.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a highly unsaturated structure. It almost always signifies the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three internal double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which, given the oxygen atoms, is very likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: These two distinct, sharp bands are in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of **two** bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. A secondary amine (-NH-) or amide would only show a single peak in this region. This single piece of evidence definitively rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is key. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This frequency is significantly higher than that of a typical conjugated amide (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹), which rules out structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: Two doublets are observed in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This clean, symmetrical pattern is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This structural feature rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, providing further evidence against **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This triplet-quartet pair unmistakably identifies an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most powerful piece of evidence in the entire dataset for determining the exact isomer. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield (so highly deshielded) must be directly attached to a very electronegative atom. This confirms it is attached to the ester oxygen, indicating an **ethyl ester fragment (-COO-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point decisively rules out the isomeric structure **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the quartet (-CO-**CH₂**CH₃) would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon and thus appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**:\n    *   **Interpretation**: This broad singlet integrates to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This peak represents the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂). Its presence corroborates the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Structure**\nEvery piece of spectroscopic evidence points to one and only one structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The correct IUPAC name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\nMatching the confirmed structure, **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, to the list of options provided in the question:\nA) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect.

The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly sound, with discrepancies in the final letter choice stemming from randomized option lists, not from errors in chemical interpretation.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis incorporating all the key points.\n\n### **Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which results in `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional double bond is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ & 3325 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Two distinct, strong bands in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would only show a single peak. This crucial detail immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**:\n    *   **Analysis**: A strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency of this peak is key. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. A conjugated amide C=O stretch usually appears at a lower frequency (<1700 cm⁻¹), which makes amide structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide** unlikely.\n\n### **Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the classic, unambiguous fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.

A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester **(-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This allows a definitive distinction between the remaining isomers:\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: The fragment is H₂N-Ph-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃. The methylene group is attached to the ester oxygen, which perfectly explains the 4.5 ppm chemical shift. **This matches the data.**\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: The fragment is H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. Here, the methylene group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. **This contradicts the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nEvery piece of spectral evidence converges on a single, unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.

This makes **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide** an unlikely candidate.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the substitution pattern and rules out meta-substituted isomers like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Most Decisive):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield (deshielded) must be directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃). This observation allows us to distinguish between the final two options:\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-CO-O-CH₂CH₃. The quartet at ~4.5 ppm is expected for the bolded CH₂. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is an isomer, H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The quartet would correspond to the bolded CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, which would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the data.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nEvery piece of spectral data aligns perfectly to identify the compound as having a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group, with the ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen. This unique structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this structure to the provided options confirms that A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectral data, supported by the unanimous chemical reasoning found in all the candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion about the structure of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**.\n*   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this additional double bond is very likely part of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* peaks, not one, is crucial. It allows us to confidently identify a primary amine, ruling out structures with secondary amines or amides, such as `N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide`.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this peak is very informative. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (e.g., `3-ethoxybenzamide`), which would usually absorb below 1700 cm⁻¹. This suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern rules out any meta- (1,3) or ortho- (1,2) substituted isomers. Therefore, `3-ethoxybenzamide` can be eliminated on this basis as well.\n*   **Peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **Peaks at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair clearly represents an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Clue):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached directly to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This observation decisively rules out the isomeric `4-aminophenyl propionate`, where the methylene protons in its `-CO-CH₂CH₃` group would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the pieces of spectral evidence assemble into only one possible structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. The correct name for this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the options provided:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect, due to the NMR quartet chemical shift.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect, this is a secondary amide, not a primary amine/ester.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect, this is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a unanimous and correct chemical reasoning to identify the unknown compound. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the agents are an artifact of the option lists being randomized for each agent, not a disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis that synthesizes the correct logic.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one for the ring and three for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this fifth degree is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   These two distinct absorption bands are located in the N-H stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* distinct peaks is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, arising from its symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one peak here. This evidence immediately rules out option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is critical. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester conjugated to an aromatic ring**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C), which would appear at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This points towards an ester, not an amide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This symmetrical \"AA'BB'\" splitting pattern is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the substitution pattern and rules out any meta- or ortho-isomers, such as **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This coupled triplet and quartet signify an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point (The Most Decisive Signal):** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the key to solving the structure. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This value decisively confirms the structure is **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** and rules out the isomer **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**. In structure A (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃), the methylene group is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of evidence converge to a single, unambiguous structure:\n1.  A benzene ring substituted in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this correct identification to the provided options confirms the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The DoU is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this additional unsaturation is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1**:\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show a single peak. This fact immediately rules out any structures that do not contain a primary amine, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm-1**:\n    *   This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm-1). This evidence rules out amide structures like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**:\n    *   **Careful Point**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring. This confirms the substitution pattern and provides further evidence against the meta-substituted isomer, **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**:\n    *   This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   This key detail allows us to distinguish between the two remaining ester isomers. It confirms the structure is an ethyl ester and rules out **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate** (isomer: H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃), where the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**:\n    *   A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, which corroborates the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge to identify a single, unique structure. The compound has a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH₂), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The structure is therefore **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (wrong isomer, wrong NMR shift).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (wrong functional group, wrong substitution).\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (wrong functional group).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
