All agents correctly identify this as a stoichiometry problem involving the neutralization of acids by a base. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be due to variations in the multiple-choice option lists provided to each agent, not due to any error in their chemical reasoning.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Initial Moles of All Reactants**\n    The first step is to calculate the moles of all acidic and basic species being mixed. The formula used is Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n    *   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):** 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):** 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Determine the Excess Reactant after Neutralization**\n    A strong base will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We must sum the total moles of acid and compare it to the total moles of base.\n    *   **Total Moles of Acid:** 0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total Moles of Base (OH⁻):** **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), the strong base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess Moles of OH⁻:** 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Concentration of the Excess Species**\n    The final pH is dictated by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions in the total volume of the mixture.\n    *   **Total Final Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻] Concentration:** 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final pH**\n    With the final concentration of OH⁻ known, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\nThis analysis, confirmed by all candidate answers, highlights several critical points where errors commonly occur:\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical step is remembering that one mole of Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, produces **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻). Failing to multiply the moles by two is a major error.\n*   **Total Neutralization:** The strong base neutralizes *all* acidic protons present, regardless of whether they come from a strong or weak acid. Therefore, the moles of HCl and CH₃COOH must be summed for the neutralization calculation.\n*   **Using the Total Volume:** The final concentration of the excess reactant must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all three solutions (1.2 L).\n*   **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH:** After finding the excess of OH⁻, the calculation `-log([OH⁻])` gives the pOH (1.38). This value is provided as option C to act as a distractor. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to find the pH of a mixed solution. A review of all candidate answers confirms there is a strong consensus on the correct calculation methodology. The final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess reactant after neutralization.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. The number of moles is calculated using the formula: `Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Moles = (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻** = Total moles of base - Total moles of acid\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe concentration must be calculated using the total final volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**4. Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C)\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical detail is that each formula unit of Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻). Forgetting to multiply the moles by two is a very common error.\n*   **Neutralization of All Acids:** When a strong base is present, it will react with all available acidic protons, from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, the moles of both acids must be summed.\n*   **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total combined volume of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L).\n*   **Distinguishing pH from pOH:** Since the base is in excess, the direct calculation from `[OH⁻]` yields the pOH. It is a classic error to report this value (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: `pH = 14 - pOH`. As seen in the options, the pOH value is listed as option A, which is a distractor.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem requiring a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to determine the final pH of a mixed solution. A comprehensive analysis of the candidate agents' answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices are clearly due to inconsistencies in the option lists they were given, not from errors in their chemical reasoning.\n\nThe definitive calculation process is as follows:\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. The number of moles is calculated by multiplying the Molarity (in mol/L) by the Volume (in L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), we must multiply by 2.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130), so the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C)\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical detail is correctly identifying that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound. Forgetting to multiply by two is a common and significant error.\n2.  **Neutralization of All Acids:** When a strong base is present, it will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). Both must be summed to find the correct total moles of acid for neutralization.\n3.  **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total combined volume of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L).\n4.  **Distinguishing pOH from pH:** After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the direct result of the -log calculation gives the pOH. It is a classic error to report this value as the final answer. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.

All candidate answers provided correctly follow the same chemical reasoning. The definitive solution can be found by consolidating their analyses and paying close attention to several critical details.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe universally agreed-upon method to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (mol/L) by the volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    First, moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol.\n    Since Ba(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions per formula unit, we multiply by two:\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants.**\nA strong base like Ba(OH)₂ will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. We must sum all moles of acid and compare them to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles(OH⁻) - Total moles(acid) = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions in the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C) = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\nBased on the analysis, there are four main points where errors can occur:\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical step is remembering that one mole of Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, produces **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻).

The definitive solution is reached by following these agreed-upon steps.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles of Reactants:** The first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all acidic and basic species being mixed. The formula for this is: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n    *   **CH₃COOH (weak acid):** 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol** of H⁺\n    *   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol** of OH⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Excess Reactant:** The strong base (OH⁻) will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. We must compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n    *   **Total moles of acid** = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n    *   Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles(OH⁻) - Total moles(acid) = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base in the total volume of the solution.\n    *   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final pH:** With the concentration of excess OH⁻, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n    *   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **pH** = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical detail, identified by all agents, is that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of the compound. Forgetting to multiply by two is a very common error.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Total Neutralization:** A strong base neutralizes all available acid, regardless of whether it comes from a strong source (HCl) or a weak source (CH₃COOH).

The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a complete consensus on the correct calculation methodology. All discrepancies in the final letter choices arise from inconsistent option ordering presented to the various agents, not from any error in their chemical reasoning. The definitive solution is reached by following the universally agreed-upon steps while being mindful of several key points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is solved by performing an acid-base neutralization calculation. The correct process, validated by all candidate answers, is as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles(OH⁻) - Total moles(acid) = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3.

Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C) = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most common and critical error is forgetting that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound. You must multiply the moles of Ba(OH)₂ by 2.\n2.  **Complete Neutralization of All Acids:** A strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons, regardless of whether they come from a strong acid (HCl) or a weak acid (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, all acid moles must be summed.\n3.  **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total combined volume of all solutions mixed together (1.2 L), not any individual volume.\n4.  **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH:** When a strong base is in excess, the calculation of `-log([excess OH⁻])` directly yields the pOH. It is a classic error to report this value (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. In this problem, the value of the pOH (1.38) is present as a distractor (Option C).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation consistently yields a pH of **12.62**.

The problem is a multi-step acid-base stoichiometry calculation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the definitive solution, incorporating all the crucial points identified.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all reactive species being mixed together. The formula for moles is `Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol).

Failing to multiply the moles of Ba(OH)₂ by two is a common and significant error.\n2.  **Complete Neutralization of All Acids**: For the purpose of stoichiometry, a strong base will completely neutralize all available protons from both strong acids (like HCl) and weak acids (like CH₃COOH). It is essential to sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total acid for the neutralization calculation.\n3.  **Use of Total Volume**: The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L in this case).\n4.  **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH**: When a strong base is in excess, the `-log([OH⁻])` calculation yields the pOH. The value of 1.38 is the pOH and is provided as option D to act as a distractor.

The definitive solution is reached by following these agreed-upon steps.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles of Reactants:** The first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all acidic and basic species being mixed. The formula for this is: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n    *   **CH₃COOH (weak acid):** 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol** of H⁺\n    *   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol** of OH⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Excess Reactant:** The strong base (OH⁻) will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. We must compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n    *   **Total moles of acid** = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n    *   Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles(OH⁻) - Total moles(acid) = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The final pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base in the total volume of the solution.\n    *   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final pH:** With the concentration of excess OH⁻, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n    *   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **pH** = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical detail, identified by all agents, is that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of the compound. Forgetting to multiply by two is a very common error.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Total Neutralization:** A strong base neutralizes all available acid, regardless of whether it comes from a strong source (HCl) or a weak source (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, the moles of all acids must be summed to find the correct excess reactant.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use of Total Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L).\n*   **Careful Point 4: pH vs. pOH Conversion:** A classic mistake is to report the pOH value as the final answer. After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the calculation `-log([OH⁻])` yields the pOH (1.38). This value is intentionally listed as option **D** to act as a distractor. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows a complete consensus on the correct calculation methodology. All discrepancies in the final letter choices arise from inconsistent option ordering presented to the various agents, not from any error in their chemical reasoning. The definitive solution is reached by following the universally agreed-upon steps while being mindful of several key points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is solved by performing an acid-base neutralization calculation. The correct process, validated by all candidate answers, is as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe number of moles is calculated using the formula: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles(OH⁻) - Total moles(acid) = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions in the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**4. Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C) = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most common and critical error is forgetting that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound. You must multiply the moles of Ba(OH)₂ by 2.\n2.  **Complete Neutralization of All Acids:** A strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons, regardless of whether they come from a strong acid (HCl) or a weak acid (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, all acid moles must be summed.\n3.  **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total combined volume of all solutions mixed together (1.2 L), not any individual volume.\n4.  **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH:** When a strong base is in excess, the calculation of `-log([excess OH⁻])` directly yields the pOH. It is a classic error to report this value (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. In this problem, the value of the pOH (1.38) is present as a distractor (Option C).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation consistently yields a pH of **12.62**.

The reasoning across all candidate answers is remarkably consistent, confirming the validity of the following method.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe foundation for solving this problem is determining the initial amount (in moles) of each reactive component using the formula: `Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n\n**2. Determine the total moles of acidic and basic species available for neutralization.**\n\n*   **Total Moles of Acid (H⁺):** A strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acid sources. Therefore, their moles are summed.\n    *   Total Moles of Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH)\n    *   Total Moles of Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total Moles of Base (OH⁻):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The most critical step is to recognize that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). Forgetting this 1:2 stoichiometry is a common and significant error.\n    *   Total Moles of OH⁻ = Moles of Ba(OH)₂ × 2\n    *   Total Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**3. Find the excess reactant after the neutralization reaction.**\nCompare the total moles of acid and base to see which one is in excess.\n\n*   Total Acid = 0.130 mol\n*   Total Base = 0.180 mol\n\nSince the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the strong base is in excess. The final pH will be basic and will be dictated by the amount of this excess strong base.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total Moles of OH⁻ - Total Moles of Acid\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the excess species in the final solution.**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The final concentration of the excess reactant must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions that were mixed together.\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = (Excess moles of OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**5. Calculate the final pH.**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Because we have the concentration of excess OH⁻, the calculation `-log₁₀([OH⁻])` yields the pOH, not the pH. Reporting the pOH as the final answer is a classic mistake.\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   Using the standard relationship: pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently yields a final pH of **12.62**. Comparing this result to the provided options:\n\n*   A) 1.38 (This is the calculated pOH, a common distractor).\n*   B) 8.92\n*   C) 12.62 (This matches our calculated pH).\n*   D) 8.68\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of all candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the calculation methodology. The final numerical result is consistent across all analyses. The problem is a multi-step acid-base stoichiometry calculation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the definitive solution, incorporating all the crucial points identified.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all reactive species being mixed together. The formula for moles is `Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of base - Total moles of acid\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe pH of the final solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final total volume.\n\n*   **Total Volume of solution** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25°C)\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂**: The most critical step is to remember that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of the compound. Failing to multiply the moles of Ba(OH)₂ by two is a common and significant error.\n2.  **Complete Neutralization of All Acids**: For the purpose of stoichiometry, a strong base will completely neutralize all available protons from both strong acids (like HCl) and weak acids (like CH₃COOH). It is essential to sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total acid for the neutralization calculation.\n3.  **Use of Total Volume**: The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L in this case).\n4.  **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH**: When a strong base is in excess, the `-log([OH⁻])` calculation yields the pOH. The value of 1.38 is the pOH and is provided as option D to act as a distractor. It is crucial to perform the final conversion step (`pH = 14 - pOH`) to find the pH as requested by the question.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**.
