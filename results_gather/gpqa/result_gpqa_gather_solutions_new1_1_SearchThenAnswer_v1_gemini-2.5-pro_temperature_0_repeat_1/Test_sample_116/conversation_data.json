A compound must be chiral (lacking a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) to be optically active.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The analysis correctly identified this molecule as chiral. The bulky groups at the ortho positions restrict rotation around the central single bond, leading to a stable, non-superimposable mirror image (atropisomerism). Thus, it is optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The script correctly identified that the second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3), making it a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: This molecule was correctly identified as achiral because it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group. It is not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule was correctly identified as achiral. As a *trans*-alkene, it possesses a center of inversion and is planar, making it superimposable on its mirror image. It is not optically active.\n\nThe code concluded that the set of optically active compounds is {1, 2}. This set matches hypothesis B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, known as enantiomers. A key feature that often leads to optical isomerism is the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality in a molecule, making it asymmetric.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, it can exist as two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and is therefore optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH) group, a hydrogen (-H) atom, a methyl (-CH3) group, and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group. A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule asymmetric and thus optically active, existing as (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule, with the formula (C6H5)2CO, has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While it can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule is achiral in solution because of this symmetry and free rotation of the phenyl groups. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Consequently, it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This hindered rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. A similar compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a well-known example of a molecule with this type of chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. As the molecule possesses a single chiral center and lacks any elements of symmetry, it is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. While the molecule can adopt a twisted conformation in its crystalline state, leading to chiral crystals, the individual molecule in solution or gas phase is achiral. This is because the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion, a point of symmetry through which any atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side. The presence of this symmetry element makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must assess their molecular structures for sources of chirality, such as chiral centers or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called atropisomerism when there is hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this compound, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two dimethyl carboxylate groups and two nitro groups. These large groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely, locking the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This restricted rotation results in two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the compound optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Optical isomerism in this molecule arises from the presence of a chiral carbon atom (an asymmetric center). The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two enantiomers, methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. It does not contain a chiral center or any other element of chirality. Therefore, an individual molecule of benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), neither of these geometric isomers is optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are optically active. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the question and the provided options is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like restricted rotation in certain molecules (axial chirality) or specific planar structures (planar chirality), as long as the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The name indicates the following substituents:\n    *   Two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   Two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered. This steric hindrance can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We need to check for the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two identical phenyl groups (C6H5). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric vs. Optical Isomerism and Symmetry):** This molecule is a geometric isomer (*trans*). We need to determine if it is also optically active. We must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups) in the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (C2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In benzophenone, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism. Although benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. It has a carbon-carbon double bond and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, in this case, there are large, bulky groups (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder the rotation around the central single bond, forcing the two rings to be non-coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, so it is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric and superimposable on its mirror image. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (in atropisomers and allenes) or a chiral plane. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   Rotation around this central C-C bond is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar).\n    *   This arrangement creates a chiral axis along the biphenyl bond. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid.

Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nExcellent. The analysis is confirmed to be correct. Here is a summary of the reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. We can assess each compound for chirality:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule does not have a chiral carbon. However, it has bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond, creating a form of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. The molecule exists as a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. A closely related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of a molecule that is optically active due to this phenomenon.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Indeed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two distinct enantiomers: (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not possess a chiral center. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it can easily interconvert between mirror-image conformations and possesses planes of symmetry in some conformations. It does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and cannot be optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, which can occur in molecules with hindered rotation about a single bond, such as in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of large groups (nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate) in all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings forces the rings to be non-coplanar. This arrangement results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, a condition known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Consequently, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis is complete and has been confirmed as correct.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule has a stereocenter. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. Since it possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: My hypothesis is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') should severely restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to non-superimposable mirror images, which are optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism.\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. I will perform a search to verify the chirality of these compounds.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially for compounds 2, 3, and 4. The identification of the chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is straightforward. The arguments based on the plane of symmetry for benzophenone and the center of inversion for dimethyl fumarate are also strong indicators of achirality. The main point to confirm is for compound 1. While ortho-substituted biphenyls are classic examples of atropisomerism, it's crucial to be certain that these specific substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate) are bulky enough to create stable, resolvable enantiomers at room temperature. A search should confirm the existence of atropisomerism in this class of compounds.\n\nDecide: I will execute a search to confirm the optical activity of each of the four compounds, paying special attention to the atropisomerism in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The search results show that substituted biphenyls with bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') exhibit atropisomerism and are optically active. Specifically, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid is a classic example of a resolvable, optically active biphenyl. The compound in question has nitro groups at 6,6' and dicarboxylate groups at 2,2', which are all bulky. This confirms it will show optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The search results explicitly state that this compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the \"simplest chiral ester\". It exists as separate (R) and (S) enantiomers. This confirms it is optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: While individual molecules of benzophenone are achiral, they can crystallize into enantiomorphic solids that show optical activity. However, in solution or as an individual molecule, it is achiral due to symmetry and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The question refers to the properties of the compound itself, not its crystalline form.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioate. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, making it achiral. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nSkeptic: The evidence is compelling. The searches confirm the initial reasoning for all four compounds. The point about benzophenone crystallizing into chiral forms is interesting but irrelevant to the inherent chirality of the molecule itself, which is the focus of the question. The atropisomerism of compound 1 and the chiral center of compound 2 are well-supported. The achiral nature of compounds 3 and 4 is also clearly confirmed. The debate can be concluded.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Due to the presence of large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around this central bond is severely restricted. This phenomenon, known as steric hindrance, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is called atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.

A compound must be chiral (lacking a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) to be optically active.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The analysis correctly identified this molecule as chiral. The bulky groups at the ortho positions restrict rotation around the central single bond, leading to a stable, non-superimposable mirror image (atropisomerism). Thus, it is optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The script correctly identified that the second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3), making it a chiral center.

It is not optically active.\n\nThe code concluded that the set of optically active compounds is {1, 2}. This set matches hypothesis B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, known as enantiomers. A key feature that often leads to optical isomerism is the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality in a molecule, making it asymmetric.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, it can exist as two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and is therefore optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH) group, a hydrogen (-H) atom, a methyl (-CH3) group, and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group. A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule asymmetric and thus optically active, existing as (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule, with the formula (C6H5)2CO, has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While it can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule is achiral in solution because of this symmetry and free rotation of the phenyl groups. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Consequently, it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This hindered rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. A similar compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a well-known example of a molecule with this type of chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. As the molecule possesses a single chiral center and lacks any elements of symmetry, it is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. While the molecule can adopt a twisted conformation in its crystalline state, leading to chiral crystals, the individual molecule in solution or gas phase is achiral. This is because the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion, a point of symmetry through which any atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side. The presence of this symmetry element makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must assess their molecular structures for sources of chirality, such as chiral centers or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called atropisomerism when there is hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically occurs when there are bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this compound, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two dimethyl carboxylate groups and two nitro groups. These large groups prevent the two rings from rotating freely, locking the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This restricted rotation results in two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the compound optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Optical isomerism in this molecule arises from the presence of a chiral carbon atom (an asymmetric center). The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two enantiomers, methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. It does not contain a chiral center or any other element of chirality. Therefore, an individual molecule of benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), neither of these geometric isomers is optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are optically active. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the question and the provided options is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like restricted rotation in certain molecules (axial chirality) or specific planar structures (planar chirality), as long as the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The name indicates the following substituents:\n    *   Two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   Two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered. This steric hindrance can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We need to check for the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two identical phenyl groups (C6H5). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric vs. Optical Isomerism and Symmetry):** This molecule is a geometric isomer (*trans*). We need to determine if it is also optically active. We must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property often arises from the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups) in the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted.

A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In benzophenone, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not exhibit optical isomerism. Although benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. It has a carbon-carbon double bond and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, in this case, there are large, bulky groups (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder the rotation around the central single bond, forcing the two rings to be non-coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, so it is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric and superimposable on its mirror image. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (in atropisomers and allenes) or a chiral plane. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   Rotation around this central C-C bond is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar).\n    *   This arrangement creates a chiral axis along the biphenyl bond. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2C=O.

Here is a summary of the reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. We can assess each compound for chirality:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule does not have a chiral carbon. However, it has bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond, creating a form of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. The molecule exists as a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. A closely related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of a molecule that is optically active due to this phenomenon.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Indeed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two distinct enantiomers: (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not possess a chiral center. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it can easily interconvert between mirror-image conformations and possesses planes of symmetry in some conformations. It does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and cannot be optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, which can occur in molecules with hindered rotation about a single bond, such as in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of large groups (nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate) in all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings forces the rings to be non-coplanar. This arrangement results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, a condition known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Consequently, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis is complete and has been confirmed as correct.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule has a stereocenter. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. A plane of symmetry can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. Since it possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: My hypothesis is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') should severely restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to non-superimposable mirror images, which are optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism.\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. I will perform a search to verify the chirality of these compounds.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially for compounds 2, 3, and 4. The identification of the chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is straightforward. The arguments based on the plane of symmetry for benzophenone and the center of inversion for dimethyl fumarate are also strong indicators of achirality. The main point to confirm is for compound 1. While ortho-substituted biphenyls are classic examples of atropisomerism, it's crucial to be certain that these specific substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate) are bulky enough to create stable, resolvable enantiomers at room temperature. A search should confirm the existence of atropisomerism in this class of compounds.\n\nDecide: I will execute a search to confirm the optical activity of each of the four compounds, paying special attention to the atropisomerism in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The search results show that substituted biphenyls with bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') exhibit atropisomerism and are optically active. Specifically, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid is a classic example of a resolvable, optically active biphenyl. The compound in question has nitro groups at 6,6' and dicarboxylate groups at 2,2', which are all bulky. This confirms it will show optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The search results explicitly state that this compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the \"simplest chiral ester\". It exists as separate (R) and (S) enantiomers. This confirms it is optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: While individual molecules of benzophenone are achiral, they can crystallize into enantiomorphic solids that show optical activity. However, in solution or as an individual molecule, it is achiral due to symmetry and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The question refers to the properties of the compound itself, not its crystalline form.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioate. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, making it achiral. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nSkeptic: The evidence is compelling. The searches confirm the initial reasoning for all four compounds. The point about benzophenone crystallizing into chiral forms is interesting but irrelevant to the inherent chirality of the molecule itself, which is the focus of the question. The atropisomerism of compound 1 and the chiral center of compound 2 are well-supported. The achiral nature of compounds 3 and 4 is also clearly confirmed. The debate can be concluded.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
