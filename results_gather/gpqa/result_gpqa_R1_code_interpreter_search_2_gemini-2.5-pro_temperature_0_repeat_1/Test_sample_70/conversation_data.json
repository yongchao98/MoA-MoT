    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) / (4 * σ * d²) * L_star ]^(1/4)\n    A simpler and more direct relationship for comparing planets in the same system is:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(a)\n    where:\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Simplify the Ratio for This Specific Problem:** We are asked to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 - A_4)^(1/4) / sqrt(a_4) ] / [ (1 - A_2)^(1/4) / sqrt(a_2) ]\n\n    The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2). Therefore, the (1 - A)^(1/4) terms cancel out.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2) / sqrt(a_4) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    T² ∝ a³\n    This can be written as a ratio:\n    (T_4 / T_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a_2 / a_4):** We need to express `a_2 / a_4` in terms of the periods `T_2` and `T_4`.\n    From Kepler's Third Law:\n    (a_4 / a_2)³ = (T_4 / T_2)²\n    Take the cube root of both sides:\n    a_4 / a_2 = (T_4 / T_2)^(2/3)\n    Now, invert the fraction to get the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Distance Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Formula:**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n    Substitute the expression from step 5:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    Using the rule of exponents (x^m)^n = x^(m*n):\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios to Calculate the Final Value:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as T1:T2:T3:T4:T5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio T_2 / T_4:\n    T_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n    Now, plug this into our final formula:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Answer:**\n    To get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4\nperiod_ratio_T2_T4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = math.pow(period_ratio_T2_T4, 1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8298821134539993\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For planets orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (d) and the fourth root of (1 - Albedo).\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / d² )^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / d^(1/2)\n    where `A` is the albedo and `d` is the orbital distance.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 - A_4)^(1/4) / d_4^(1/2) ] / [ (1 - A_2)^(1/4) / d_2^(1/2) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify Based on Given Information:** The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A_4 = A_2). Therefore, the (1 - A)^(1/4) terms cancel each other out. The equation simplifies to:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = d_2^(1/2) / d_4^(1/2) = (d_2 / d_4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (d). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    P² ∝ d³\n    We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    (P_4 / P_2)² = (d_4 / d_2)³\n\n6.  **Solve for the Distance Ratio (d_2 / d_4):** We need to rearrange Kepler's Law to find the distance ratio in terms of the period ratio.\n    First, take the cube root of both sides:\n    (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3) = d_4 / d_2\n    Now, invert the fraction to get the ratio we need for our temperature calculation:\n    d_2 / d_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from step 6) into our simplified temperature ratio equation (from step 4):\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    Using the power rule for exponents ((x^a)^b = x^(a*b)), we get:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the orbital period ratios are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now we can calculate the final temperature ratio:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    Let's use Python to compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is 2 / 3.5.\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio ** (1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe code output is approximately 0.8298, which rounds to 0.83. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (d) by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(d)\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 and Planet 2 is therefore:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d4)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d):\nP² ∝ d³\nSo, (P4 / P2)² = (d4 / d2)³\nThis gives us the ratio of the distances:\nd2 / d4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting this into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P2 / P4)^(2/3)) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
