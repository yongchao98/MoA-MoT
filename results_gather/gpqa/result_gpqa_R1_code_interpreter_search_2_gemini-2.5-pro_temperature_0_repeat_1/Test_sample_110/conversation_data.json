    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile source (after deprotonation).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base indicates a **Michael Addition reaction**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The bulky t-BuOK removes the proton from C6 to form a thermodynamically stable, substituted enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The C6-enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The initial ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   After the reaction, a new substituent, -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt, is attached to C6.\n    *   The carbon at C6, which was tertiary, becomes a quaternary carbon, bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and the new ethyl propanoate chain.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The product is an ester, so we can name it as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The substituent is attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The substituent is a complex cyclohexyl ring. To name it according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment.\n        *   **C1' (point of attachment):** This was the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group. -> **1-methyl**\n        *   **C2':** This was the original C1 (carbonyl carbon). -> **2-oxo**\n        *   **C3':** This was the original C2. It has an ethyl and a methyl group. -> **3-ethyl, 3-methyl**\n    *   Combining the substituent names: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition reaction**, where the carbanion from the nitroalkane is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base (KOH) abstracts an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The structure of the acceptor is CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The bond forms between the CH(NO₂) group of the nitropropane and the CH(CH₃) group of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final step is protonation of the intermediate enolate/nitrile anion by water (H₂O).\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent name is a ...nitrile.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   The chain is: **C**N - **C**H₂ - **C**H(CH₃) - **C**H(NO₂) - **C**H₂ - **C**H₃\n        *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) is on C3. -> **3-methyl**\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is on C4. -> **4-nitro**\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is correct, B is correct.\n*   D) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
