    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often much simpler to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    *   x = r * cos(θ)\n    *   y = r * sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can see that:\n    *   x^2 = (r * cos(θ))^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) * k ) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Identify the System:**\n    The simplified potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    *   V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    *   where V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    *   and V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This means the system is a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation is separable, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension:**\n    The energy levels for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 * k_eff * q^2 are given by:\n    E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this as V_x(x) = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2.\n        So, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m).\n        The energy levels for the x-motion are:\n        E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2.\n        The effective spring constant is k_y = k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m).\n        The energy levels for the y-motion are:\n        E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Here, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and they can be any non-negative integer (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
