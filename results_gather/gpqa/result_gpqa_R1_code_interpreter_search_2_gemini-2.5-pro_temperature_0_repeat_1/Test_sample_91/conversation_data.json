    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of each type of bond. The chemical formula is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens in the methyl groups, plus 1 carbon in the chain. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   **=CH-**: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen in the chain, plus 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens in the methyl group. Total: 2 C, 4 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 C, 2 H.\n*   **-CH=**: 1 C, 1 H.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 1 carbon in the chain, plus 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens in the methyl groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbons (C)** = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H)** = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, we count the specific types of bonds (C-H, C-C, C=C) in the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds**: We can see two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds from the two CH3 groups to the first C: 2\n    *   Bond between =CH- and -CH2-: 1\n    *   Bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-: 1\n    *   Bond from the CH3 group to the -CH- in the chain: 1\n    *   Bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-: 1\n    *   Bond between -CH2- and -CH=: 1\n    *   Bonds from the two CH3 groups to the last C: 2\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following formula based on Hess's Law:\n\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements in reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements (reactants)**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard state to gaseous atoms.\n*   Reactants: 12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g).\n*   Products: 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n\nEnergy = (12 * Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 * Bond energy of H-H)\nEnergy = (12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol * 100 kJ/mol)\nEnergy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound (product)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22(g), to form gaseous atoms.\n\nTotal Bond Energy = (No. of C-C bonds * BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds * BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds * BE_C-H)\nTotal Bond Energy = (9 * 200 kJ/mol) + (2 * 300 kJ/mol) + (22 * 400 kJ/mol)\nTotal Bond Energy = 1800 kJ/mol + 600 kJ/mol + 8800 kJ/mol = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol**\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Convert the Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Now we check the given options. Options C and D are in kJ/g, so we need to convert our answer to these units.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic mass of C) + (22 * Atomic mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\n### **5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the compound)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g (This has the correct number for kJ/mol, but incorrect units)\n\nOur calculated value of ~11.45 kJ/g matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# Number of atoms in the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.

Total bond energy of the compound (product: C12H22(g))\ntotal_bond_energy_compound = (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H) + \\\n                             (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_C_double_bonds * bond_energy_C_C_double)\n\n# 3.
