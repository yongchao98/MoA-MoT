    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free `Co(II)` ion and the various thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n3.  **Define Total Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants:** The concentrations of the complexes are related to the free `Co²⁺` concentration and the free thiocyanate `[SCN⁻]` concentration through the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Distribution Fraction (α):** The fraction of any single species is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is denoted as `α₂`.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 3 and 4, we can express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now, we can write the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Approximate Ligand Concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is significantly larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means that the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form the complexes is small compared to the total amount available. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M\n\n7.  **Calculate the Value:** Now, we substitute the given numerical values into the formula for `α₂`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator first (let's call it `Φ`):\n    `Φ = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `Φ = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)² + 63*(0.1)³ + 16*(0.1)⁴`\n    `Φ = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.01) + 63*(0.001) + 16*(0.0001)`\n    `Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `Φ = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, let's calculate the numerator term for `α₂`:\n    `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Finally, calculate `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Φ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction `α₂` by 100.\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `0.16916 * 100%` = `16.916%`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 16.916% is very close to option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration in M\n\n# The denominator of the alpha fraction formula\nphi = 1 + beta1 * L + beta2 * (L**2) + beta3 * (L**3) + beta4 * (L**4)\n\n# The numerator for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2)\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / phi\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage}%\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species. This percentage is determined by the mole fraction of this complex, denoted as `α₂`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free thiocyanate ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions above, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe total concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total concentration of the metal `c(Co)` (0.01 M). Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (Φ):\n`Φ = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)² + 63(0.1)³ + 16(0.1)⁴`\n`Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 40(0.01) + 63(0.001) + 16(0.0001)`\n`Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`Φ = 2.3646`\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40(0.1)² = 40(0.01) = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%. The Python code execution confirms this calculation, yielding 16.916%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
