    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n    The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. Let the molar mass of Y be M_Y.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    Solving for M_Y:\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M_Y = (n * 12.9276) / 0.3196\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n to find potential elements:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, Ar)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb - Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Tb)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl)\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Am, Pu)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Element Y.**\n    *   The clues \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\" point to an element that forms extremely powerful oxidizing fluorides. This is characteristic of elements in high oxidation states, like PuF6, or strong Lewis acids like SbF5 (which reacts with xenon fluorides).\n    *   Let's check the most promising candidates, Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu), by calculating the precise mass percentage.\n        *   **If Y = Sb and n=3, A2 = SbF3.**\n            M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n            %F = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 * 100% = 31.88%. This is a very close match to 31.96%.\n        *   **If Y = Pu and n=6, A2 = PuF6.**\n            M(PuF6) = 244.06 + 6 * 18.998 = 358.05 g/mol.\n            %F = (6 * 18.998) / 358.05 * 100% = 31.84%. This is also a very good match.\n\n3.  **Use the molecular weight options for A4 to distinguish between Sb and Pu.**\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4, which is also a binary fluoride of Y.\n    *   **If Y = Pu**, the known binary fluorides are PuF3 (M≈301), PuF4 (M≈320), PuF5 (M≈339), and PuF6 (M≈358). None of these molecular weights fall into any of the given options (A: 160-180, B: 140-160, C: 110-130, D: 220-240). Therefore, Y is not Plutonium.\n    *   **If Y = Sb**, the main binary fluorides are SbF3 (M≈179) and SbF5 (M≈217).\n        *   The molecular weight of SbF3 is 178.75 g/mol, which falls perfectly into range **A) 160-180**.\n        *   The molecular weight of SbF5 is 216.76 g/mol, which does not fit well into any range (it is close to range D, 220-240, but not inside it).\n\n    This strongly suggests that Y is Antimony (Sb) and A4 is SbF3.\n\n4.  **Verify the other clues with Y=Sb and A4=SbF3.**\n    Let's build a consistent scenario.\n    *   **Y = Sb** (Antimony).\n    *   **A2 = SbF3** (based on the mass percentage calculation).\n    *   **A4 = SbF3** (based on its molecular weight falling into option A). Note that A2 and A4 can be the same substance.\n    *   **A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.\" The reaction A1 -> SbF3 + F2 implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so A1 must be SbF5. This part of the problem contains inconsistencies, as SbF5 is a colorless liquid, is thermally stable, and does not oxidize Xenon metal directly (though it is a very strong Lewis acid and reacts with Xenon fluorides). We must assume these descriptive parts of the problem are flawed, as the quantitative data points strongly towards Sb.\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. A3 can also interact with xenon.\" Fluorination of Sb can yield SbF3 or SbF5. The interaction with xenon (compounds) points to the strong Lewis acid SbF5. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n    *   **A4/A5 Reaction**: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 (SbF3), A5 can be obtained.\" The reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 is not a standard, simple reaction, which is another weak point in the problem's chemistry. However, we are led to this conclusion by the molecular weight data.\n    *   **A5 Decomposition**: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" If A5 were a subfluoride of antimony, it would readily decompose/hydrolyze in water. SbF3 itself hydrolyzes in water (SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF), so this property is consistent with the system.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Despite several inconsistencies in the qualitative descriptions (color, reactivity of A1), the quantitative data (%F and MW options) point unambiguously to Y=Sb and A4=SbF3.\n    The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is M(Sb) + 3*M(F) ≈ 121.8 + 3*19.0 = 178.8 g/mol.\n    This value falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
