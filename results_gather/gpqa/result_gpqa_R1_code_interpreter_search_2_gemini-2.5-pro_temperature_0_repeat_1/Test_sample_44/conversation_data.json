    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A key property of identical fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin up, `+1/2`, or spin down, `-1/2`).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of two fermions can occupy any given energy level `E_n`.\n\n**2. Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n*   We can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of `E`:\n    *   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = E`\n    *   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   The ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy for the system. To achieve this, we must fill the energy levels from the bottom up, placing the four fermions in the lowest available states.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). The level is now full.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). This level is also now full.\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    `E_ground = (Energy of 2 particles in n=1) + (Energy of 2 particles in n=2)`\n    `E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n    `E_ground = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** `n=2`.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n    `E_1st = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = `2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = `E + (2 * 4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 2 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\n*   Comparing the energies of the excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, etc.), the lowest is `15E` and the second lowest is `18E`.\n*   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is `18E`.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
