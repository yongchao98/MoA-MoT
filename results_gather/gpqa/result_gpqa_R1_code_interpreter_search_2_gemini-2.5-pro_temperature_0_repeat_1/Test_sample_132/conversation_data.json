    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\nThe solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to give 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\n\nThe key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a buffer system corresponding to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\nThe three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid are:\n1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nWe need to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which is governed by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Concentrations of the Buffer Components**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- added to the solution.\n\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n*   Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe [H+] in the solution is controlled by the buffer pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the Ka2 equilibrium:\nH2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\nKa2 = ([H+] * [HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.106 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\nHPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\nKa3 = ([H+] * [PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated. We can use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- as its equilibrium concentration because the dissociation is negligible (Ka3 is very small).\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.106 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.237 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a python script for better precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 to L\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations ---\n# Moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2-\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium ---\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium ---\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nPO4_3minus_conc = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.3e}\")\n```\n<<<\nB",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n\n**1. Identify the species in solution and their initial concentrations.**\n*   The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.200 L.\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\n*   The key species forming the buffer are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each component:\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    This gives 0.007348 mol of H2PO4-.\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    This gives 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.\n\nNext, we calculate the initial molar concentrations:\n*   Initial [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n*   Initial [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**2. Determine the relevant equilibria.**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps:\n1.  H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n2.  H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n3.  HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nThe solution contains a mixture of H2PO4- and its conjugate base, HPO4^2-. This is a buffer system governed by the second dissociation equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n**3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\nWe use the expression for Ka2 to find the [H+] of the buffer solution. We can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations because Ka2 is small.\nKa2 = ([H+] * [HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\nRearranging to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\nNow we use the expression for Ka3, which involves the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\nKa3 = ([H+] * [PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\nRearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nWe use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-].\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation, giving a result of 6.236e-07. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 6.24x10^-7 M\nC) 5.48x10^-7 M\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
