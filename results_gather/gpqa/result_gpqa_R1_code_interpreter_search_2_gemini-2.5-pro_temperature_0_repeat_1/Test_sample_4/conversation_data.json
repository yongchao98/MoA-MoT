    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Operator and Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane).\nFor a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means $\\phi=0$.\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**2. Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, substitute the matrix forms of the Pauli matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, with the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo find the value of the constant $a$, we normalize the eigenvector, meaning its norm (length) must be 1.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 (1^2 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\theta/2)} = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nChoosing the simplest phase (real and positive), we get $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect angles.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our result.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are state vectors and do not have units of $\\hbar$.\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
