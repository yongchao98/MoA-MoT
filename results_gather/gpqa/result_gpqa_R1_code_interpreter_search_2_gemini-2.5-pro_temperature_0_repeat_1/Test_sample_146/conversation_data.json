    "Annihilation is a process in which a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide and their mass is converted into energy, in the form of other particles. In this problem, a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate to produce four new particles, two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The fundamental principles governing this interaction are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state (before annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information which implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume it is effectively at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   Since both particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We assume $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ have the same mass.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. For the total momentum to be zero, the four particles must move away from the point of annihilation in such a way that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   By symmetry, the energy released from the annihilation will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. This means each of the four particles will have the same total energy, and therefore the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, we can substitute the known values to find $\\gamma$ and then solve for the velocity $v$.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# From the conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# We can solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# We can rearrange this to solve for v/c:\n# gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - (v/c)^2)\n# 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 / gamma^2\n# (v/c)^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\n# v/c = sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma^2))\n\n# Calculate v/c\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - (1 / (gamma**2)))\n\n# The velocity v is v_over_c times the speed of light, c.\n# The question asks for the velocity of particle A, which is typically expressed as a fraction of c.\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\n>>>\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\nThe calculation shows that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
