    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\n*   The total energy (E_total) of the system.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):**\nSince the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light, c), we must use the Lorentz velocity subtraction formula. The formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v1 and v2 (as measured from a stationary frame) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   v1 = 0.6c (velocity of the first astronaut)\n*   v2 = 0.5c (velocity of the second astronaut)\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857... c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E1).**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / √0.64\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate E1:\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E2).**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / √0.75\nγ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate E2:\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\nE2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the total energy of the system.**\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\n**4. Compare with Options:**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is v_rel ≈ 0.14c.\n*   Our calculated total energy is E_total ≈ 5.96 mc².\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc²\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc²\nD) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²\n\nOption C matches our calculations for both relative speed and total energy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
