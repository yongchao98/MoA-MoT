    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane (C10H16) is a tricyclic alkane.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions suggesting a complex reaction, likely involving rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong absorbance characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. The frequency is typical for a non-conjugated ketone in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained system.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H).\n        *   The total integration is 2+10+2 = 14 protons. The molecular formula of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction involves replacing two Br atoms with one O atom, so the formula of Product 1 is C10H14O. This is consistent with the proton count.\n        *   The simple pattern of the NMR spectrum (2H, 10H, 2H) suggests a high degree of symmetry in Product 1 (e.g., a C2 axis or a plane of symmetry).\n        *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusual. It is too high for a typical proton alpha to a ketone and too low for a typical vinyl proton in an unstrained system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the subsequent reactions to deduce the nature of Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n*   **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. This confirms that Product 1 is a ketone, and Product 2 is the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   Product 1 (C10H14O, Ketone) → Product 2 (C10H16O, Alcohol)\n*   **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   The fact that ozonolysis is performed proves that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   Since Product 2 is just the reduced form of Product 1, **Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone**.\n    *   The IR of Product 1 (1720 cm⁻¹) suggests the C=O and C=C bonds are not conjugated (an α,β-unsaturated ketone would absorb at a lower frequency, ~1685 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Ozonolysis of a -CH=CH- unit with reductive workup (DMS) yields two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The question asks about the coupling of a hydrogen atom in Product 3, which confirms that aldehydes (which have a C-H bond) are formed, not ketones. This implies the double bond in Product 2 was of the -CH=CH- type.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is a dialdehyde-alcohol (C10H16O₂), formed by cleaving the C=C bond of the unsaturated alcohol Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n\n1.  **Plausible Structure of Intermediates:** While the exact structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine from the given information without resorting to obscure literature, we can deduce the general structural features of the final product. The formation from adamantane under rearrangement conditions often leads to other polycyclic systems. A plausible, albeit complex, series of rearrangements could lead to a bicyclic enone. Let's consider a plausible bicyclic skeleton that results from the adamantane rearrangement, for example, a bicyclo[3.3.2]decane system. Let's assume Product 2 is a bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-6-en-2-ol.\n\n2.  **Ozonolysis:** Cleaving the C=C bond in a bicyclic system opens one of the rings, resulting in a larger monocyclic system. In this case, ozonolysis of a bicyclic C10 alkene-alcohol will produce a C10 monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol. The resulting ring will be a 10-membered cyclodecane ring.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** Product 3 is a cyclodecane ring substituted with one hydroxyl (-OH) group and two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The exact substitution pattern would depend on the exact structure of the precursor, but we can analyze the local environment of the aldehyde protons regardless.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR of Product 3:**\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) will be the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically resonate at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of these aldehyde protons. The splitting is caused by coupling to protons on adjacent carbons.\n    *   An aldehyde proton (H-C=O) couples to the protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon) via three bonds (³J coupling). It can also exhibit weaker coupling to protons on the β-carbon via four bonds (⁴J coupling).\n    *   The dialdehyde product is formed by breaking a C=C bond within a ring structure. Let's analyze the fragments that are formed: `...-CαHn-CHO`.\n    *   The precursor (Product 2) is a complex bicyclic alcohol. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are likely part of the complex framework, including both methylene (-CH₂-) and methine (-CH-) groups.\n    *   When the ring opens to form Product 3, the new aldehyde groups will find themselves adjacent to these former parts of the bicyclic framework. It is highly probable that the local environment of an aldehyde group will be `H(CO)-CαH₂-CβH-...` or `H(CO)-CαH-CβH₂-...`.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected coupling pattern for such a fragment:\n        *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will couple to the protons on the α-carbon. If Cα is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cα is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet.\n        *   **⁴J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will also couple to the protons on the β-carbon. If Cβ is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cβ is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet. (Note: ⁴J couplings are generally smaller than ³J couplings).\n    *   Let's consider a likely scenario based on a plausible rearranged structure. For example, the ozonolysis of a bicyclo[3.3.2]decene derivative as reasoned in the scratchpad. This leads to a structure where one aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH- group and its β-carbon is a -CH₂- group. The other aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group and its β-carbon is a -CH- group.\n        *   Case 1: `H(CO)-CH-CH₂-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH proton into a **doublet**. This doublet is further split by the β-CH₂ protons into **triplets**. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   Case 2: `H(CO)-CH₂-CH-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH₂ protons into a **triplet**. This triplet is further split by the β-CH proton into **doublets**. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of doublets (td)**, which has the same appearance as a doublet of triplets.\n    *   Therefore, regardless of which of the two non-equivalent aldehyde protons is the most deshielded, its coupling pattern is expected to be a **doublet of triplets** (or triplet of doublets).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 is an aldehyde proton. Based on the likely structure resulting from the ozonolysis of a rearranged bicyclic alcohol, this proton will be coupled to both an adjacent methine (-CH-) and a next-nearest methylene (-CH₂-) group (or vice versa). This coupling will result in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
