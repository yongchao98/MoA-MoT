    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus:**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus is \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n    *   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus:**\n    *   The RHIC accelerates the nucleus, not the entire atom. So, we need the mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus.\n    *   We can find this by taking the atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom and subtracting the mass of its electrons. A neutral Li atom has 3 electrons.\n    *   Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li atom: 6.0151228 amu.\n    *   Mass of one electron: 0.00054858 amu.\n    *   Mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus = (Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li) - (3 * mass of an electron)\n    *   Mass of nucleus = 6.0151228 - (3 * 0.00054858) = 6.01347706 amu.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    *   The rest energy is given by Einstein's equation, E₀ = m₀c².\n    *   We need to convert the mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy units (GeV). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c² = 0.931494 GeV/c².\n    *   Rest Energy (E₀) = (Mass of nucleus in amu) * (0.931494 GeV/amu)\n    *   E₀ = 6.01347706 * 0.931494 GeV ≈ 5.6015 GeV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor accounts for relativistic effects at high speeds. It is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   The speed (v) is given as 0.96c.\n    *   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28.\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   The total energy of a moving particle is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor: E = γ * E₀.\n    *   E = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's perform the calculation using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\natomic_mass_li6 = 6.0151228  # in amu\nmass_electron = 0.00054858  # in amu\namu_to_gev = 0.931494  # 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c^2 = 0.931494 GeV/c^2\nv_over_c = 0.96  # speed of the nucleus as a fraction of c\n\n# 1. Calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus\nmass_nucleus_amu = atomic_mass_li6 - (3 * mass_electron)\n\n# 2. Calculate the rest energy (E0) in GeV\nrest_energy_gev = mass_nucleus_amu * amu_to_gev\n\n# 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_gev = gamma * rest_energy_gev\n\n# Print the final result rounded to the required precision\nprint(f\"{total_energy_gev:.4f}\")\n```\n20.0054\n\nBased on the calculation, the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 20.0054 GeV. Reviewing the options, none of them match this result. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the mass of the nucleus to be approximately the mass number (A=6) multiplied by the mass of a nucleon (proton/neutron), which is a common approximation.\n\n**Alternative Calculation (Approximation):**\n*   Mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is roughly 1 amu.\n*   Mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus ≈ 6 amu.\n*   Rest Energy E₀ ≈ 6 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu ≈ 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV.\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ 19.96 GeV.\n\nThis result is also close to 20.0 GeV. It appears there might be a discrepancy in the provided options or the initial values used in a standard textbook problem from which this question might be derived.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to choose the closest answer, let's re-examine the options. The calculated value is ~20.0 GeV. The closest option is 20.132 GeV.\n\nLet's assume the question intended to use a slightly different value for the mass of Li-6. For instance, if the rest energy were exactly 5.637 GeV, then E = 3.5714 * 5.637 GeV ≈ 20.132 GeV. This rest energy corresponds to a mass of 6.0516 amu, which is a reasonable, though slightly different, value for the Li-6 nucleus. Given the multiple-choice format, it's likely that option C is the intended answer, resulting from slightly different initial mass constants.\n\nBased on the rigorous calculation, the answer is ~20.0054 GeV. The closest provided option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user's request has been solved.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\nThe reasoning process is as follows:\nThe user wants to find the total relativistic energy of a specific nucleus moving at a high speed.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass**\n*   The nucleus is specified as \"Li with 3 neutrons\". Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n*   To find the total energy, we first need the rest mass (m₀) of the nucleus. We can calculate this by taking the atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom and subtracting the mass of its 3 electrons.\n    *   Atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom ≈ 6.0151228 amu.\n    *   Mass of a single electron ≈ 0.00054858 amu.\n    *   Rest mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.0151228 amu - (3 * 0.00054858 amu) = 6.01347706 amu.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)**\n*   The rest energy is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, E₀ = m₀c².\n*   We need to convert the mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy units, typically Giga-electron Volts (GeV). The standard conversion factor is 1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c² = 0.931494 GeV/c².\n*   E₀ = (6.01347706 amu) * (0.931494 GeV/amu) ≈ 5.6015 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n*   For an object moving at a relativistic speed, its total energy is magnified by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n*   The problem states the speed of the nucleus is v = 0.96c.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\n*   The total energy (E) is the rest energy (E₀) multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV ≈ 20.0054 GeV.\n\n**5. Compare with Provided Options**\n*   The calculated energy is approximately 20.0054 GeV.\n*   Let's examine the given options:\n    A) 18.475 GeV\n    B) 23.069 GeV\n    C) 20.132 GeV\n    D) 21.419 GeV\n*   Our calculated value (20.0054 GeV) does not exactly match any of the options. However, it is extremely close to option C (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (about 0.6%) can be attributed to slight variations in the constants (like the mass of Li-6 or the amu-to-GeV conversion factor) used in the source of the question. In a multiple-choice scenario, the closest answer is the correct one.\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous step confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of 20.0054.\n\n<<<C>>>"
