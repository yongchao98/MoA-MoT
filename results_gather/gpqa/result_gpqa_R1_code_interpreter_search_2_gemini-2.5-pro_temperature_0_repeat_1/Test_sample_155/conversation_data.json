    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H       CH2CH2CH3\n        \\     /\n         C = C\n        /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction must produce either an achiral product or a racemic mixture. The product, *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane, has two stereocenters and is chiral (it lacks a plane of symmetry). Therefore, the product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H3O+).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by water on the protonated epoxide, which occurs with *anti*-stereochemistry (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond).\n    *   Let's consider the opening of one enantiomer, say (4R,5R)-epoxide. The attack by water is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups overall.\n    *   The opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide via an *anti*-attack will lead to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide will lead to the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are the same compound. This compound has two stereocenters but also possesses a plane of symmetry (in its eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in its staggered conformation), making it a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\nA useful mnemonic for stereochemistry: The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. **T**rans-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso-compound.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H           H\n        \\         /\n         C   =   C\n        /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   The product, *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of the *meso*-epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one stereocenter (e.g., C4) leads to one enantiomer of the diol product, for example, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other stereocenter (C5) is equally likely and leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material (*meso*-epoxide) is achiral, the product must be optically inactive, which in this case is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\nAnother useful mnemonic: **C**is-alkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic-mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The *meso*-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus will have different retention times and appear as separate peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will have the same retention time and elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the *meso*-diol will produce one peak, and the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols) will co-elute, producing a second peak.\n    *   **Total peaks observed = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   Peak 1: *meso*-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total peaks observed = 3.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
