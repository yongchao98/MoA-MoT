    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is given by:\n`I(θ) = I_0 * [2 * J_1(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]^2`\nwhere:\n*   `I_0` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J_1` is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `θ` is the angle from the central axis.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator `J_1(k * a * sin(θ))` is equal to zero. Let `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the zeros of `J_1(x)`.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, the condition for the minima becomes:\n`k * a * θ = x_m`\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\nwhere `x_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum:\n`θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\nFirst, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of `J_1(x)`:\n*   First zero, `x_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `x_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   `θ_1 = (x_1 * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ_2 = (x_2 * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (x_2 - x_1) * λ / (2π * a)`\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The first two non-trivial zeros of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nx1 = 3.831706\nx2 = 7.015587\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is given by:\n# Delta_theta = (x2 - x1) * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi)\n\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.507\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value 0.507 is closest to 0.506. The small difference is due to rounding of the Bessel function zeros. Let's re-evaluate with the output. The output is 0.507 when rounded to 3 decimal places. Option D is 0.506. The difference is minimal and likely due to the precision of the values used for the zeros in different sources. However, it is the only plausible answer.\n\nFor reference, option C, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum: `θ_1 = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`. The question asks for the distance between the first and second minima.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is `Δθ ≈ 0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
