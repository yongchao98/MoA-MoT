    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (positive pion, π⁺) into two other particles (positive muon, μ⁺, and a muon neutrino, ν). To solve this, we need to apply two fundamental conservation laws from physics:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the particles involved can move at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use the equations of special relativity.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** E = KE + m₀c², where KE is the kinetic energy and m₀c² is the rest mass energy.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.\n\n### **2. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion (π⁺) is stationary. This means its initial momentum is **zero**.\n*   **Final State:** The decay produces a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). Let their momenta be **p_μ** and **p_ν**.\n\nAccording to the conservation of momentum:\nInitial Momentum = Final Momentum\n0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\nThis implies **p_μ** = -**p_ν**.\n\nThis is a vector equation. It tells us that the two product particles fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\nSo, |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its kinetic energy is zero. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\nAccording to the conservation of energy:\nE_initial = E_final\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n### **4. Set up the Equations**\n\nWe can express the total energies of the final particles using the energy-momentum relation:\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the neutrino (ν): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this type of problem. We assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0).\n    For a massless particle, the energy-momentum relation simplifies to:\n    E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (0)²  =>  E_ν = p_νc = pc\n    Also, for a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν).\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n1.  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  E_ν = pc\n\nSubstitute (3) into (1):\nm_πc² = E_μ + pc  =>  E_μ = m_πc² - pc\n\nNow, square this expression for E_μ:\nE_μ² = (m_πc² - pc)² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)²\n\nWe now have two expressions for E_μ². Let's set them equal to each other:\n(pc)² + (m_μc²)² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)²\n\nThe (pc)² term cancels out from both sides:\n(m_μc²)² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, we can solve for `pc`, which is the energy of the neutrino (E_ν):\n2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nSince E_ν = KE_ν = pc, this formula gives us the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of the pion\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of the muon\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# KE_nu = E_nu = pc = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\nKE_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# From energy conservation: m_pi_c2 = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu_c2) + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_nu\nKE_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (ν).\n\nThis pair of values matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, so we must use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, taking into account special relativity.\n\n### **1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion (π⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The decay produces a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). For the total momentum to remain zero, the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n    *   Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   p_μ = p\n    *   p_ν = p\n\n### **2. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\n*   According to the conservation of energy:\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   139.6 MeV = E_μ + E_ν\n\n### **3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nWe use the formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)² to relate energy, momentum, and rest mass.\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)² = (pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²\n    *   The total energy of the muon is also the sum of its kinetic energy (KE_μ) and its rest mass energy: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n\n*   **For the neutrino (ν):**\n    *   Neutrinos have negligible mass, so we assume their rest mass is zero (m_ν = 0).\n    *   E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (0)²  =>  E_ν = p_νc = pc\n    *   For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = E_ν.\n\n### **4. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations:\n1.  139.6 = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_μ² = (pc)² + (105.7)²\n3.  E_ν = pc\n\nFrom (1), we can write E_μ = 139.6 - E_ν.\nSubstitute this and E_ν = pc into equation (2):\n(139.6 - E_ν)² = (E_ν)² + (105.7)²\n\nExpand the left side:\n(139.6)² - 2 * 139.6 * E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (105.7)²\n\nThe E_ν² term cancels out:\n(139.6)² - 279.2 * E_ν = (105.7)²\n\nNow, solve for E_ν (which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν):\n279.2 * E_ν = (139.6)² - (105.7)²\nE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / 279.2\nE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / 279.2\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n**KE_ν = E_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). From the conservation of energy:\nTotal Energy Released = KE_μ + KE_ν\nm_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + KE_ν\nKE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. The code execution confirms these values more precisely as 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
