    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Necessary Concepts:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean lifetime ($\\tau$) of a particle in its rest frame is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame than in its own rest frame. The lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$) is given by $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance ($d$) the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$). So, $d = v \\cdot \\tau' = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. The velocity is often expressed as $\\beta = v/c$. The relationship between them is $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. A useful combination is $\\gamma\\beta = p/m$ (in units where c=1), which can be derived from $E = \\gamma m c^2$ and $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$. This gives $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$. The momentum $p$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combine the formulas to get a direct expression for the mean decay distance, $d$.\n        $d = v \\gamma \\tau = (\\beta c) \\gamma (\\hbar / \\Gamma) = \\gamma \\beta c (\\hbar / \\Gamma)$\n    *   It's often more convenient to use the product $\\hbar c$.\n        $d = \\gamma \\beta (\\hbar c / \\Gamma)$\n    *   We can calculate $\\gamma\\beta$ from the given energy and mass.\n        From $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we get $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n        From $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$, we get $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the equation for $d$:\n        $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Gather the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Production energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Mass, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The physical constant $\\hbar c$ (hbar-c) is approximately $197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$, which is $1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    To ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script to perform the numerical calculation. The script will implement the final formula derived in step 3.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# hbarc in MeV*m.

The minor difference (about 0.02%) is likely due to slight variations in the constants used to generate the problem's options versus the high-precision CODATA values used in our calculation.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Concepts:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime in Rest Frame ($\\tau$):** The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame than in its rest frame due to relativistic effects. The lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$) is given by $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance ($d$):** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$). So, $d = v \\cdot \\tau' = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** It's convenient to work with the dimensionless velocity $\\beta = v/c$.

Substituting $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$, we get the expression:\n        $d = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   **Calculating $\\gamma\\beta$:** We can find the product $\\gamma\\beta$ from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass energy ($mc^2$). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, where $p$ is the momentum. The momentum can also be expressed as $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, which gives $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$. Combining these, we can solve for $\\gamma\\beta$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n        $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Final Equation:**\n    By substituting the expression for $\\gamma\\beta$ into the equation for the decay distance, we get a single formula to solve the problem:\n    $d = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Gather Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The physical constant $\\hbar c$ (hbar-c) is approximately $1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We can use a Python script to perform the numerical calculation accurately, using the final formula derived above.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# hbarc in MeV*m.
