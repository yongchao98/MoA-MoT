    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex interaction with a many-body system (the nucleus) into a much simpler one. It assumes that a high-energy probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with just one of the nucleons inside the nucleus, and that this interaction happens so quickly (like an \"impulse\") that the other nucleons are just spectators. During this brief moment, the struck nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, not bound within the nucleus.\n\nNow let's analyze the four statements in light of this concept:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. It allows us to treat the total interaction as a sum of interactions with single nucleons, rather than having to consider complex multi-nucleon interactions (known as meson-exchange currents). This is a necessary condition.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons (a phenomenon called final-state interactions), the simple picture is ruined. The measurement would be distorted and would not reflect the properties of the initial interaction with the single nucleon. Therefore, assuming the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA) to be valid.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement is about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not about how the nucleon as a whole behaves within the nucleus. The impulse approximation is concerned with the nucleon's state of motion and its interaction with the nuclear potential. Whether the quarks inside it are treated relativistically or not is a separate issue related to the model of the nucleon, not the model of the nuclear interaction. Therefore, this is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid that the binding potential holding the nucleon in the nucleus doesn't have time to act. The nucleon is effectively \"free\" for the duration of the interaction. This is a necessary condition.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon acts as if it were free from binding forces during the interaction (4), and that the rest of the nuclear environment does not interfere with the process (2). Assumption (3) is an independent approximation about the nucleon's internal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
