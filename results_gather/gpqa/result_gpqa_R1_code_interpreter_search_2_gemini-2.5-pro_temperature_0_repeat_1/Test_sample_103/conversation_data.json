    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The planet's gravity causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass. This wobble results in a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight, which can be measured as a shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The maximum periodic shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the observed maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\Delta \\lambda_1$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:**\n    Given:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio is:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n4.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the RV amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin i}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    Where:\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Relation Based on Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n    *   The problem does not provide information about the orbital inclinations ($i$). In such cases, it is standard to assume that the viewing conditions are comparable, i.e., $i_1 = i_2$. This is a necessary assumption to arrive at one of the given numerical answers.\n\n    With these parameters being the same for both systems, they cancel out when we take a ratio, and we are left with the core proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n6.  **Set up the Equation for the Ratios:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the amplitudes as:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\frac{1/T_2^{1/3}}{1/T_1^{1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods ($T_2 / T_1$):**\n    We substitute the value of $K_2 / K_1 = 1.4$ into the equation:\n    $1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we first cube both sides:\n    $(1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\n    The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $T_2 / T_1$. So, we need to take the reciprocal:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{(1.4)^3}$\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    $(1.4)^3 = 1.4 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.4 = 1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K2/K1 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nratio_K = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between K and the orbital period T is K ‚àù T^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (T1/T2)^(1/3).\n# We want to find the ratio T2/T1.\n# (K2/K1)^3 = T1/T2\n# T2/T1 = 1 / (K2/K1)^3\n\nratio_T = 1 / (ratio_K**3)\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314125320891\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the ratio $T_2 / T_1$ is approximately 0.36. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are correct. The code output confirms the result.\n\nThe ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
