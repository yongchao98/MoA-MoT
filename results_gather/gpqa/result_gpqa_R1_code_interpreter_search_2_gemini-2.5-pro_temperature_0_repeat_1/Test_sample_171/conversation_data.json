    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that describes this is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (say, an excited state `j` and a ground state `i`) to the temperature `T` of the system.\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two states.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we can call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n    The ratio `N_j / N_i` represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the level `j`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Note that `ΔE`, `k`, `g_j`, and `g_i` are constants related to the iron atom and fundamental physics, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1.\n\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expressions from the Boltzmann equation into the relationship from step 4.\n\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the combined equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To remove the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm rule `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the terms to get `ln(2)` by itself on one side.\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`.\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Find a common denominator for the term in the parentheses: `(1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`.\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a known physical constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    `1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation matches option B exactly.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\n<<<B>>>"
