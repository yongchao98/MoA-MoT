    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    We need to consider two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **S Frame (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S' Frame (Glass Frame):** This is the frame that is moving along with the piece of glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities**\n    Let's define the velocities involved according to the conventions of special relativity. We'll set the direction of the light beam and the glass's motion as the positive direction.\n\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the observer (v):** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam. So, the velocity of the S' frame (glass) relative to the S frame (lab) is `v`.\n\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass's rest frame (u'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, should be taken as 1. Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer in the S' frame (at rest with the glass) is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam is propagating in the positive direction, `u' = +1/n`.\n\n    *   **Velocity of light in the laboratory frame (u):** This is the quantity we need to find. It's the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    To find the velocity `u` in the S frame, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, which correctly combines velocities in special relativity. The formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object in the S frame.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the S' frame.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the S' frame relative to the S frame.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values**\n    Now, we substitute the values we've identified into the formula. Remember, we are using `c=1`.\n\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Let's compare this result with the given choices:\n\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) 1\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
