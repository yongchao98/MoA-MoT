    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (denoted as 3s) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (denoted as 1s). The decay occurs \"via two dipole transitions\". This implies a two-step cascade process, where the atom first decays to an intermediate state, which then decays to the final state. A direct transition from 3s to 1s is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, would be 0.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = ±1\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted, but for decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so n_final < n_initial.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n    *   **First transition:** |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>\n        *   Initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n        *   Initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay, n' must be less than 3. The most probable dipole transition is to the nearest available energy level, which is n'=2. So, the intermediate states are in the 2p subshell.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Let's check if the possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n        *   Initial state: |2,1,m'>. Final state: |1,0,0>.\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule.\n        *   For m' = -1, 0, or 1, a transition to m=0 is possible (Δm = 0, ±1).\n        *   So, all three intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>.\n\n4.  **Determine the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay path. The overall process has three possible paths, via the three intermediate states |2,1,m'>. The probability of a specific path is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state is certain to decay to the specified final state.\n\n    *   **First transition probability:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>\n        The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator, |<2,1,m'| **d** |3,0,0>|^2.\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). When a system in a spherically symmetric state decays, it has no preferred direction. As a result, the emission is isotropic, and all the magnetic sublevels of the final state (the |2,1,m'> states) are populated equally.\n        This can be shown more formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'> is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from l=0 to l'=1, the relevant coefficient <0,0; 1,m' | 1,m'> is equal to 1 for all possible values of m' (m' = -1, 0, 1). Since the radial part of the matrix element and all other factors are independent of m', the transition rates are identical for all three final states m'.\n        *   Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n        Since these are the only possible decay channels from the 3s state, the total decay rate is the sum of these three equal rates. The probability (branching ratio) for decaying into any one of these specific intermediate states is therefore 1/3.\n\n    *   **Probability of the entire route:**\n        The probability of the cascade following a specific route, for example |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, is the branching ratio of the first step.\n        *   P(route via |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        *   P(route via |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   P(route via |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be 1/3).\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be 1/3).\n    *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be 1/3).\n\n    The only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
