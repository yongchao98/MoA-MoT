    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass % H = (y * Atomic Mass of H) / (x * Atomic Mass of C + y * Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity:\n    0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n*   Rearranging the equation:\n    0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n    1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n    1.7136x = y - 0.1428y\n    1.7136x = 0.8572y\n    y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of other substances which are clearly related to a six-membered ring structure. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for C6H12:\n    Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane. As D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be either a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane (i.e., benzene).\n*   The reaction that forms Y from X is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this typically refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are dehydrogenated (oxidized) to form a stable aromatic ring, and others are hydrogenated (reduced) to form a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, the two products in mixture Y are most likely **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water, fitting the description.\n*   The problem states Y is an equimolar mixture, so the reaction produces one mole of cyclohexane for every one mole of benzene.\n    Reaction: ... -> 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H6\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total atoms in products = (C6H12) + (C6H6) = C12H18.\n    *   Therefore, the total atoms in reactants (A+B) must also be C12H18.\n*   Since X is an equimolar mixture of A and B, this C12H18 comes from one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only cyclohexane. This implies that both A and B are C6 cyclic compounds. So, A has the formula C6Ha and B has the formula C6Hb.\n*   From the atom balance, we have: a + b = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). This means their hydrogen counts (a and b) must be less than 12 (the count for saturated cyclohexane).\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's find a pair of molecules that fit these criteria. A very common C6 unsaturated cyclic compound is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n    *   If we set A = cyclohexene (C6H10), then a = 10.\n    *   Then, b = 18 - a = 18 - 10 = 8. So, B must be C6H8.\n*   We need to find an isomer of C6H8 that fits the criteria: a C6 ring, unsaturated, no conjugated bonds, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** has two double bonds separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. It has a C6 ring and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is a perfect fit for B.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
