    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and the analysis of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a symmetric ketone.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a rearrangement that results in a ring contraction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The ring opens to relieve strain, typically to form the more stable carbanion intermediate, which is then protonated. This process results in the formation of a carboxylic acid with a smaller ring.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, yielding **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl), forming **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and does not reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde, yielding **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogen atoms are in different chemical environments and would produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring. This plane makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is unique. There is only one of its kind. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the carbon of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is a methine proton (CH) and is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. This means one proton is in a different spatial orientation relative to the aldehyde group than the other. Therefore, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. By symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives us two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 positions, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct sets of protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
