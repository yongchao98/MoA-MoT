    "*   **Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible constitutional isomers, known as tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to these carbonyl groups, and each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are acidic and can participate in tautomerization. In fact, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists almost entirely in its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), because this form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable. Therefore, it exhibits tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
