    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields, and thus the scalar and vector potentials, are governed by Maxwell's equations. For time-varying sources, these lead to wave equations for the potentials V and A:\n\n*   $∇²V - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²V}{∂t²} = -\\dfrac{ρ}{\\epsilon_o}$\n*   $∇²\\vec{A} - \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\dfrac{∂²\\vec{A}}{∂t²} = -μ_o\\vec{J}$\n\nwhere ρ is the charge density and J is the current density.\n\nThe solutions to these equations are the \"retarded potentials,\" which means the potential at a field point `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the source at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The delay `t - tr` is exactly the time it takes for a light signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n### 2. Defining the Source and Retarded Time\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   Charge density: $ρ(\\vec{r'}, t') = q δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that light emitted from the charge at position `s(tr)` at time `tr` reaches the observer at position `r` at time `t`.\n\n*   $t - tr = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\nLet's use the notation given in the problem:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(tr)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nThe retarded time condition becomes: $c(t - tr) = d$.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the retarded potentials are given by integrals over the source distributions:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{ρ(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, tr)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for a point charge, we get:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(tr) δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r'$\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electrodynamics. The dependence of the retarded time `tr` on the integration variable `r'` inside the delta function requires careful treatment. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of the integration is:\n$\\int \\dfrac{δ³(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d³r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(tr) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|})} \\right]_{tr}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation (`d`, `d`, `v`):\nThe integral evaluates to: $\\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} = \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} = \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}$\n\n### 4. Final Expressions for V and A\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\nFor the vector potential, the velocity `v(tr)` is evaluated at the retarded time and can be treated as a constant during the spatial integration.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{c}{cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{μ_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is the static potential and an incorrect relation for A.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - **This matches our derived expressions.**\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect sign in the denominator. This would correspond to advanced potentials, which are not physically realized.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is the static potential. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
