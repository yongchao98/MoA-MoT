Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2.

Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K1 and K2). The formula derived from Kepler's Third Law is:\n    M = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   M is the total mass of the system.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use the Eclipsing Information:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. An eclipse can only occur if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Proportionality:** Since 2, π, and G are constants, and we assume sin³(i) ≈ 1 for both systems, the total mass (M) is directly proportional to the product of the period (P) and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2).\n    M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can use this proportionality to find the ratio of the masses of the two systems:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\n\n6.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1_1 = 10 km/s\n        *   K1_2 = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2_1 = 15 km/s\n        *   K2_2 = 10 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities:**\n    *   For System 1: K1_total = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   For System 2: K2_total = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values into the Ratio Formula:**\n    M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\n9.  **Perform the Calculation:** To simplify the calculation and avoid potential errors, a Python script can be used.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1_1 + K1_2\nK2_total = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\n# M1 / M2 is proportional to (P1 * K1_total^3) / (P2 * K2_total^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_total**3)) / (P2 * (K2_total**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.
