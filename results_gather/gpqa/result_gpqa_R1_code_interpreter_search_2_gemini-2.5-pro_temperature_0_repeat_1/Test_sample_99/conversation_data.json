    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and an analysis of the final statements.\n\n**Reaction Sequence Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Compound A (C3H6) to Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6, which corresponds to propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n    *   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4), which is a characteristic addition reaction for alkenes.\n    *   **A is Propene (CH3-CH=CH2).**\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   **B is 1,2-Dibromopropane.**\n\n2.  **Compound B to Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   Alcoholic KOH is a strong base that causes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr will be eliminated.\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **C is Propyne.**\n\n3.  **Compound C to Compound D:**\n    *   Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube.\n    *   This reaction condition causes the cyclic polymerization of alkynes to form aromatic compounds. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize.\n    *   Reaction: 3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene\n    *   **D is 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene).**\n\n4.  **Compound D to Compound E:**\n    *   Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4).\n    *   This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The methyl groups are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In mesitylene, the 2, 4, and 6 positions are equivalent and highly activated.\n    *   Reaction: Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2,4,6-Trimethylnitrobenzene\n    *   **E is 2,4,6-Trimethylnitrobenzene.**\n\n5.  **Compound E to Compound F:**\n    *   Compound E (2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl).\n    *   This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-Trimethylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline\n    *   **F is 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesitylamine).**\n\n6.  **Compound F to Compound G:**\n    *   Compound F (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), an aromatic primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, formed in situ from NaNO2/HCl at 0-5 °C).\n    *   This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group into a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline + HNO2 --> 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n    *   **G is 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.**\n\n7.  **Compound G to Compound H:**\n    *   Compound G (2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), typically by warming the aqueous solution.\n    *   The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O --(NaOH, warm)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol\n    *   **H is 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol (Mesitylol).**\n\n**Evaluation of the Statements:**\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is characteristic for phenols, typically producing a distinct color like violet, blue, or green. The ferric chloride solution itself is yellow. If no reaction occurs (which can happen with sterically hindered phenols like H), the solution would remain yellow. However, stating that it \"gives a yellow color\" is not the standard description of a positive test. A positive result implies a color change *to* a new, characteristic color. Therefore, this statement is an inaccurate description of the chemical test for phenols.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are fundamental starting materials for the synthesis of a large class of dyes, particularly azo dyes (formed via diazotization and coupling). This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and give one singlet. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and give a second singlet. Thus, its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are correct. Statement A is incorrect because the ferric chloride test for phenols results in colors like violet, blue, or green, not yellow. A yellow color would indicate a negative test (the color of the reagent), not a positive result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
