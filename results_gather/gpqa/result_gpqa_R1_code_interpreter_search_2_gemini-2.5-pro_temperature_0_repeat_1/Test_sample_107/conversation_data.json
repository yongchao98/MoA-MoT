    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`<H>`)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic dipole moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ due to the orbital motion of an electron is related to its orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian is:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}L_z B$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, which we denote as $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, are obtained by replacing the operator $L_z$ with its eigenvalues, which are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton** ($\\mu_B$).\n$\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nSo, the energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B \\cdot m \\cdot B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ has \"small values\". For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can take $m=1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nA useful form of this equation is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers (nm):\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{nm}}{1 \\, \\mu\\text{m}} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the Balmer series transition from n=4 to n=2 in the Hydrogen atom, which is a visible light transition).\n\n### **3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo compare them, let's find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.551 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is a very small number, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis result is expected, as the energy shifts due to external magnetic fields (the Zeeman effect) are typically very small perturbations compared to the energy differences between the principal electronic energy levels of an atom.\n\n<<<D>>>"
