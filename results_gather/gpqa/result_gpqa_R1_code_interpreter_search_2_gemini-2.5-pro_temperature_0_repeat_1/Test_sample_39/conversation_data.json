    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the context.** The conversation takes place between two chemists leaving a synthetic organic chemistry lab. This setting is crucial. In synthetic chemistry, a major part of the work involves not just making new compounds (synthesis) but also purifying them from starting materials, byproducts, and solvents.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the phrase \"on top of each other.\"** This is a common piece of laboratory jargon. It's a metaphorical way of saying that two or more substances are behaving identically during a separation process, making it impossible to isolate them from one another. It visually evokes the most common analytical and preparative technique in organic chemistry: chromatography.\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider the primary purification technique: Chromatography.**\n    *   **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** This is a quick method to check the progress of a reaction and the purity of a sample. Compounds are spotted on a plate coated with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a solvent (mobile phase) runs up the plate. Compounds separate based on how strongly they adhere to the stationary phase versus how well they dissolve in the mobile phase. The result is a series of spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar properties, their spots will not separate and will appear as a single, elongated spot, or literally \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **Column Chromatography:** This is the preparative version of TLC, used to separate larger quantities of material. The mixture is loaded onto the top of a column packed with the stationary phase, and the mobile phase is passed through. Compounds travel down the column at different rates and are collected in separate fractions. If two compounds travel at the same rate, they will elute from the column at the same time (co-elute) and will not be separated. In essence, their \"bands\" within the column are \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the physical property that governs chromatographic separation.** The separation in the most common forms of chromatography (normal-phase with silica or alumina) is based on the **polarity** of the molecules.\n    *   Polar compounds interact strongly with the polar stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and move slowly.\n    *   Non-polar compounds interact weakly with the stationary phase and are carried along more quickly by the (typically less polar) mobile phase.\n    *   Therefore, if two compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way. They will move at the same speed and will not be separated. This is the root cause of the \"on top of each other\" problem.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is used for characterization, not separation (unless using specialized chiral chromatography). Two compounds can have very different optical rotations but similar polarities, making them hard to separate. Conversely, enantiomers have equal and opposite optical rotations but are identical in polarity and cannot be separated by standard chromatography. This is not the primary meaning.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This directly explains why the compounds would fail to separate during chromatography, the most common purification technique. This perfectly matches the jargon \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would be a problem for separation by distillation. While a valid purification issue, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more strongly associated with the visual output of chromatography (TLC spots, column bands) than with co-distilling liquids.\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** All molecules experience these interactions. The problem isn't that the compounds are sticking to *each other*, but that they are interacting with the *chromatography medium* in a similar fashion due to their similar overall properties (i.e., polarity).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most likely meaning of the chemist's statement is that their attempt at purification by chromatography has failed because the desired compound and an impurity have nearly identical polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
