    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one stereocenter at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration. This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These two compounds are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (it can be drawn in a conformation where the top half is a mirror image of the bottom half). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. This means (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different shapes and polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, different functional groups - ether vs. diol). They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two peaks from Reaction I products plus the two peaks from Reaction II products result in a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all distinct stereoisomers, and there are five stereoisomers in the mixture, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
