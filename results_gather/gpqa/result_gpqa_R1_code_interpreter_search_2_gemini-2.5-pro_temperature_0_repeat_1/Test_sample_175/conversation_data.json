    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements.\n1.  First, measure the observable `P` on an initial state `|ψ>` and get the result `0`.\n2.  Second, measure the observable `Q` on the state *after* the first measurement and get the result `-1`.\n\nThe probability of this sequence is given by:\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state after P=0)`\n\n**2. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   **Initial state vector `|ψ>`:**\n    `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]` (This is a column vector)\n\n*   **Operator `P` matrix:**\n    ```\n    P = [[0,   1/√2, 0  ],\n         [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n         [0,   1/√2, 0  ]]\n    ```\n\n*   **Operator `Q` matrix:**\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0,  0],\n         [0, 0,  0],\n         [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**3. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nProbabilities in quantum mechanics are calculated using normalized state vectors. A state vector `|ψ>` is normalized if `<ψ|ψ> = 1`, where `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`.\n\n*   Calculate the squared norm of `|ψ>`:\n    `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The norm is `||ψ|| = √6`.\n*   The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm>`, is:\n    `|ψ_norm> = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**4. First Measurement: Probability of getting P=0**\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.** The possible results of measuring `P` are its eigenvalues. We need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `p=0`.\n    *   The characteristic equation is `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0   ],\n              [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2 ],\n              [ 0,  1/√2,  -λ  ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1-λ²)`\n    *   The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n*   **Find the eigenvector for `p=0`**. We solve `P|v> = 0|v>`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]`ᵀ `= [0, 0, 0]`ᵀ\n    This gives the equations: `y/√2 = 0` (so `y=0`) and `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` (so `x=-z`).\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We choose `x=1` to get `[1, 0, -1]`.\n*   **Normalize this eigenvector.**\n    `||v||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`. The norm is `√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|v_p=0> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n*   **Calculate the probability `Prob(P=0)`.** This is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |<v_p=0 | ψ_norm>|²`\n    `<v_p=0 | ψ_norm> = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**5. State Collapse After the First Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring `P` and obtaining the result `0`, the state of the system \"collapses\" to the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n*   **New state `|ψ'>`:**\n    `|ψ'> = |v_p=0> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**6. Second Measurement: Probability of getting Q=-1**\n\nNow we measure `Q` on the new state `|ψ'>`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for `q=-1`**.\n    `Q` is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (`1, 0, -1`) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    For the eigenvalue `q=-1`, the corresponding normalized eigenvector is `|u_q=-1> = [0, 0, 1]`.\n*   **Calculate the probability `Prob(Q=-1)` in the state `|ψ'>`.**\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'>) = |<u_q=-1 | ψ'>|²`\n    `<u_q=-1 | ψ'> = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] )`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'>) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Combined Probability**\n\nFinally, we multiply the probabilities of the two sequential events.\n\n*   `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state after P=0)`\n*   `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
