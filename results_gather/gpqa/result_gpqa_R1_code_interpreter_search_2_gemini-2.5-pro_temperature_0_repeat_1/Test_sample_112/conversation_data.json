    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion, which has a mass of 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and B) C6H10O2.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 DoU\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecule must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula can only account for one double bond (e.g., the C=O in hexanoic acid), but not the additional C=C bond.\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula perfectly accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to the C=O bond and the C=C bond identified in the spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (presence of a carboxylic acid and an alkene) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
