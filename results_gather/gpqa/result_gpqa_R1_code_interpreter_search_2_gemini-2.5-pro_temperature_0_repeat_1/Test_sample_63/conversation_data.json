    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition.**\n\nThe gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. This is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc.\n    *   The weight did not change. This means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   The weight increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   The weight increase is 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents. It is likely nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products (H₂O, O, N₂) must have come from the original salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming the final gas C is N₂, all nitrogen ends up as 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O in H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O reacted with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements equals the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. These are characteristic of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nThe decomposition reactions at ~200°C are:\n*   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   **NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n\nLet's see if these reactions fit the experimental data. The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Products from n moles of NH₄NO₂:** n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   **Products from n moles of NH₄NO₃:** n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n**Total initial products:**\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles.\n*   N₂ = n moles.\n*   N₂O = n moles.\n\nNow, let's trace these products through the tubes:\n1.  **Tube 1:** Absorbs 4n moles of H₂O. From our data, this is 0.20 mol.\n    *   4n = 0.20  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**.\n2.  **Tube 2:** N₂ and N₂O are not acidic, so no change. This is consistent.\n3.  **Tube 3:** The gas mixture entering is n moles of N₂ and n moles of N₂O. Hot copper reacts with N₂O but not N₂.\n    *   Reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   n moles of N₂O will react, adding n moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   The mass increase is due to these n moles of oxygen. From our data, 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted.\n    *   n = 0.05 mol. This is consistent with our previous calculation.\n4.  **Final Gas:** The gas leaving Tube 3 is the original N₂ plus the N₂ formed from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Total N₂ = (original N₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = n + n = 2n.\n    *   Total moles of final gas = 2n = 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C calculated from the volume.\n\nThe hypothesis that the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ in a 1:1 molar ratio (with n=0.05 mol for each) is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the molar masses of the identified salts\n# Molar masses (g/mol): N=14, H=1, O=16\nmolar_mass_A = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 2*16  # NH4NO2\nmolar_mass_B = 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 3*16  # NH4NO3\n\n# Moles of each salt (n) was determined to be 0.05 mol\nn = 0.05\n\n# Verify the total mass\ntotal_mass = n * molar_mass_A + n * molar_mass_B\n# print(f\"Verified total mass: {total_mass} g\") # Expected: 7.20 g\n\n# Calculate the number of atoms in each salt formula unit\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2  # N H4 N O2\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3  # N H4 N O3\n\n# Calculate the total number of atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the role of each tube and the data obtained.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with and absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It will react with oxidizing gases, such as oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O), by taking their oxygen atoms to form copper(II) oxide (CuO).\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** This is the gas that did not react in any of the tubes.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is inert to the reagents, it is very likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products (H₂O, O, and N₂) must have originated from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂, the 0.10 mol of N₂ contains:\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms from H₂O = 1 × Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms from reaction with Cu = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, which suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common ones that decompose upon heating are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's say there are 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\n**Total products:**\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles.\n*   Total N₂ = n moles.\n*   Total N₂O = n moles.\n\nNow, let's check these against the experimental data:\n*   **Water:** We found 0.20 mol of H₂O. So, 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   **Reaction with Cu:** The gas mixture entering tube №3 is N₂ and N₂O. Only N₂O reacts: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. This reaction transfers one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O. So, 'n' moles of N₂O will transfer 'n' moles of oxygen atoms. We found that 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms reacted. Therefore, **n = 0.05 mol**. This is consistent.\n*   **Final Gas:** The gas leaving tube №3 is the original N₂ (n moles) plus the N₂ formed from the N₂O reaction (n moles). Total final gas = n + n = 2n. Using our value, 2n = 2(0.05) = 0.10 mol. This matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C we calculated.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# This code calculates the final answer based on the identified salts.\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3: 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\n# Total number of atoms in the two salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
