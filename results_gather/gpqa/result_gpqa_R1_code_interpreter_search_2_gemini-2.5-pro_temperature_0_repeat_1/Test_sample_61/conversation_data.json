    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Product**\n\nThe target product is **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. Let's decipher this IUPAC name to determine its structure.\n*   **Parent name:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This means we have a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached to it. The carbon atom of the ring to which the -CHO group is attached is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituent:** `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This group has the structure -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl.\n*   **Location:** `1-`. The substituent is attached to the C1 position of the parent cyclohexane ring.\n\nLet's assemble the structure. The C1 carbon of the parent ring is bonded to:\n1.  The -CHO group.\n2.  The -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl substituent.\n3.  C2 of its own ring.\n4.  C6 of its own ring.\n\nThis is a valid structure with a tetravalent carbon at C1. Where did this structure come from? It is the product of an **aldol addition reaction** between two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  A base removes the acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The alpha-proton is on C1 of the ring. This forms an enolate ion (a carbanion at C1).\n    2.  This enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the final product, which is an aldol adduct (a beta-hydroxy aldehyde).\n\nSo, the overall goal of the synthesis is:\n**Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe core task is to synthesize the intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, from the starting material, **ethynylcyclohexane**.\n\n**2. Synthesize the Intermediate: Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (Cyclohexyl-C≡CH)\n*   **Intermediate:** Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cyclohexyl-CHO)\n\nWe need to transform the -C≡CH group into a -CHO group. This involves cleaving the C≡C bond and leaving a single carbon attached to the ring, which becomes the aldehyde. A very effective way to achieve this is through ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene.\n    2.  Cleave the alkene using ozonolysis with a reductive workup to get the aldehyde.\n\nLet's see how this can be done.\n*   Direct ozonolysis of the starting alkyne (Cyclohexyl-C≡CH) would yield cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cyclohexyl-COOH), not the desired aldehyde.\n*   We must first modify the alkyne. A common strategy is to add a carbon atom, creating an internal alkyne, which can then be reduced to an alkene and cleaved.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this strategy.\n\n*   **Step 1 (Common to all options):** Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a strong base. This deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form a sodium acetylide salt.\n    `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + NH₃`\n\nNow let's look at the rest of each sequence.\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  `...ethyl chloride`: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃CH₂Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₂CH₃` (1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne)\n2.  `Li/liq. NH₃`: This reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene. `→ trans-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`\n3.  `O₃/ H₂O`: This is ozonolysis with an **oxidative workup**. It cleaves the alkene to form carboxylic acids. `→ Cyclohexyl-COOH + CH₃CH₂COOH`. This does not produce the required aldehyde intermediate. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  `...methanol`: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃OH → Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + Na⁺OCH₃⁻`. Methanol is an acid here and simply protonates the acetylide, regenerating the starting material. No reaction proceeds. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  `...methyl chloride`: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃` (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne)\n2.  `H₂/Pd`: This is catalytic hydrogenation. It will reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane. `→ Cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃` (propylcyclohexane). An alkane is unreactive and cannot be converted to the target product. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\n1.  `...methyl chloride`: `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃` (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne). This step successfully creates an internal alkyne.\n2.  `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`: This is Lindlar's catalyst, which selectively reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. `→ cis-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n3.  `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`: This is ozonolysis with a **reductive workup** (using dimethyl sulfide). It cleaves the alkene to form aldehydes. `→ Cyclohexyl-CHO + CH₃CHO`. This step successfully produces our key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (along with acetaldehyde).\n4.  `Ba(OH)₂`: Barium hydroxide is a base used to catalyze the aldol addition. In the mixture of aldehydes, the self-addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will occur, forming the desired target product. While other aldol products will also form (crossed-aldol and acetaldehyde self-aldol), this sequence is the only one provided that can produce the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the reaction steps, we can conclude that sequence B is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices to synthesize the target molecule. It correctly employs alkylation, partial reduction, and reductive ozonolysis to create the necessary aldehyde precursor, followed by a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to form the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
