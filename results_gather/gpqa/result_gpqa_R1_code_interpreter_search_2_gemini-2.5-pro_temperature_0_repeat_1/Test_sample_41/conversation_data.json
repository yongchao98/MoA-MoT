    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. We are also told that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are constant across the system. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (\\frac{1}{a})^{1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    From the proportionality above, we can square both sides to find the relationship for the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $T_{eq}^2 \\propto a^{-1}$\n    This means the semi-major axis is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$ or $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    (This assumes the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the mass of the star, which is a standard and safe assumption in such problems. The given mass ratios are distractors, as their effect on the orbital period would be minuscule without knowing the planet-to-star mass ratio, which is typically very small, e.g., < 0.001).\n\n    From Kepler's law, we can find the proportionality for the period $P$:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships to Link Period and Temperature:**\n    Now we can substitute the relationship for $a$ from step 2 into the relationship for $P$ from step 3:\n    $P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$\n    $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$\n    This gives us a direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature: the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (Planet X and Planet Y) can be written as:\n    $\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} = (\\frac{T_{eq,Y}}{T_{eq,X}})^3$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{P_3}{P_1}$. Using the formula from step 4:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^3$\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\n    We can find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}}$ by multiplying the given ratios:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\cdot 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3$\n\n    Let's compute the final value.\n```python\n# Given temperature ratios\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio T1/T3\nT1_div_T3 = T1_div_T2 * T2_div_T3\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1 is (T1/T3)^3\nP3_div_P1 = T1_div_T3**3\n\nprint(P3_div_P1)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.386. This value is closest to 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the formula:\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\nThis is because all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, making other factors in the equilibrium temperature equation constant.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the equilibrium temperature:\n$a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\nKepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\nWhich means:\n$P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nNote that the planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, so they do not significantly affect the orbital period. The mass information provided is extraneous.\n\nNow, we can combine the relationships to find how the orbital period ($P$) depends on the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$):\n$P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$\n$P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$\n\nThis means that the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets is inversely proportional to the cube of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 ($\\frac{P_3}{P_1}$), we can write:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^3$\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n1.  $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n2.  $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}}$, we multiply the two given ratios:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
