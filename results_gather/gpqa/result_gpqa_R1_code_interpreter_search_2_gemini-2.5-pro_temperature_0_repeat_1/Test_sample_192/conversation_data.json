    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Input Information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `plx`. This gives us the relationship:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Number of Stars\":**\n    In astronomy, when discussing star counts as a function of parallax (or apparent magnitude), \"the number of stars\" usually refers to the cumulative count. In this case, it means the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. This is because observational limits mean we detect all stars with parallaxes above a certain threshold.\n    So, we interpret the given relation as `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`, where `N(>plx)` is the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`r`). The standard formula is `r = 1/plx`, where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relationship to Distance:**\n    A parallax *greater than* `plx` corresponds to a distance *less than* `r`. Therefore, the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`, `N(>plx)`, is the same as the number of stars within a distance `r`, which we can denote as `N(<r)`.\n    We can substitute `plx = 1/r` into our relationship:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the total number of stars within a sphere of radius `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Quantity to be Found:**\n    The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r` with thickness `dr`. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Derivative:**\n    We have the cumulative number of stars as a function of `r`: `N(<r) = C * r^5`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    Now, we differentiate this expression with respect to `r` to find the number of stars per unit distance range:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n\n7.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    From the differentiation, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
