    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the free electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   A negative charge will be attracted towards the `+q` charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, the electric flux through our Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), if the flux is zero, the total charge enclosed ($Q_{enc}$) must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    *   Thus, a total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. This positive charge will move to the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface, $q_{outer}$, will be $+q$.\n    *   So, we have:\n        *   Charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n        *   Induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n        *   Induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor isolates the region outside from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity. The charges inside the cavity (`+q`) and on the inner surface (`-q`) combine to produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity (specifically, within the conductor and outside the conductor).\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is produced *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius `R`. Due to the symmetry of the sphere and the shielding effect of the conductor (which makes the outer surface \"unaware\" of the non-symmetric arrangement inside), this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the shell.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this shell is the center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's position (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center to P (`l`), and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. This is a classic example of electrostatic shielding. The field outside only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
