    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This immediately suggests isotopes like Deuterium (D, ²H), Carbon-13, Nitrogen-15, etc., are involved.\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This points to a highly energetic chemical reaction, typical of strong reducing agents, strong bases, or alkali metals with protic solvents like water.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gas molecules:\n        *   ¹H₂ (dihydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   ⁴He (helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely in this chemical context).\n        *   ²H₂ or D₂ (dideuterium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Excellent candidate, given Clue 1).\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (dinitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (dioxygen): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Possible).\n        *   D₂O (heavy water vapor): 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Possible, but D₂O is a liquid at STP).\n        Given the context of a violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (from Clue 1), **D₂ gas is the most logical identity for W.**\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** This means one of the products is insoluble in the reaction medium (liquid Y).\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B.** This suggests G is a solvate (like a hydrate) or a compound that decomposes to release a volatile substance B.\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). The melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)** is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is D₂O.**\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. Strong reducing agents reduce both groups. For example, the reduction of pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would yield propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). The starting material has 3 oxygens, and the product has 2. This indicates X is a **strong reducing agent.**\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used in organic chemistry.** This reinforces the idea that X is a common chemical reagent.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   We have identified B as D₂O and W as D₂.\n    *   The reaction involves X reacting with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which can be heated to produce D₂O.\n    *   This strongly suggests the reaction is between a powerful deuterated reducing agent (X) and heavy water (Y = D₂O).\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs (\"Substance X\") would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test these two candidates against the clues. Let Y be D₂O.\n        *   **Candidate 1: X = LiAlD₄.**\n            *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n            *   **Violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent and explosive. The same applies here. (✓)\n            *   **Gas W = D₂?** Yes. (✓)\n            *   **Precipitate G?** The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide/deuteroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. (✓)\n            *   **G → B (D₂O) on heating?** Yes, metal hydroxides/deuteroxides decompose upon heating to form metal oxides and water/heavy water. 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (✓)\n            *   **All clues fit perfectly.**\n        *   **Candidate 2: X = NaBD₄.**\n            *   Reaction: NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂ + 4D₂\n            *   **Violent?** The reaction of NaBH₄ with water is vigorous but generally much more controlled than LiAlH₄. It might not be described as \"violent\" in the same way. (Partial fit)\n            *   **Gas W = D₂?** Yes. (✓)\n            *   **Precipitate G?** The product is sodium metaborate (NaBO₂). Sodium salts are typically highly soluble in water. This does not fit the \"precipitate\" clue well. (✗)\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:**\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a much better fit for all the clues than NaBD₄. Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements** present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen** (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium** (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of **all instances** of these elements in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   **Four** atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium).\n        *   **One** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n    *   Sum the masses:\n        *   Mass from Hydrogen/Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# Define the mass numbers of the isotopes in LiAlD4.\n# The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# The elements are H, Li, Al.\n# Lightest element: H (present as isotope D). Mass number = 2.\n# Heaviest element: Al (present as isotope 27Al). Mass number = 27.\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n# There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n\nmass_of_deuterium_atoms = 4 * 2\nmass_of_aluminium_atoms = 1 * 27\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_deuterium_atoms + mass_of_aluminium_atoms\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Gas W.**\n    *   The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C. This is a very close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the most likely candidate given that deuterium is involved. The molecule D₂ (dideuterium) consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate G. Heating G releases D₂O (B). This strongly suggests that Y is also D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + G (precipitate).\n    *   The fact that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas indicates that X is a deuteride-based reducing agent.\n    *   The clue about the reaction with a keto acid confirms that X is a strong reducing agent. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups, for example, reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH, 3 oxygens) to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH, 2 oxygens). This matches the description that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agents of this type used in organic chemistry are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The problem states X contains a heavier isotope, so we consider their deuterated analogs: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate (G). Heating Al(OD)₃ would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This fits all the clues.\n    *   Let's test NaBD₄: NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂ + 4D₂. Sodium metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so it would not form a precipitate. This contradicts the clues.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses.**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium): Mass = 27\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium): Mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of these masses: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n```python\n# The substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements in LiAlD4 are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).\n\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n# We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D or 2H) = 2\n# Mass number of Aluminium (27Al) = 27\n\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\n# Number of Aluminium atoms = 1\n# Number of Deuterium atoms = 4\n\n# Calculate the total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium).\nmass_of_aluminium = 1 * 27\n\n# Calculate the total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium).\nmass_of_deuterium = 4 * 2\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_aluminium + mass_of_deuterium\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Deciphering the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n    *   **Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K. This is approximately 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given that the reaction involves a substance with a heavier isotope (likely deuterium), the gas D₂ is a prime candidate. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   **Substance X and the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing D₂ gas (W) and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (B). This chain of events strongly suggests that Y is also D₂O, and X is a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The reaction would be: X + D₂O → D₂ + G. The fact that G decomposes to D₂O upon heating implies G is a deuterated metal hydroxide (e.g., M(OD)n).\n    *   **Confirmation of X's Identity:** The clue about the reaction with a keto acid (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) yielding a product with 2 oxygen atoms points to a strong reduction reaction. This is characteristic of reagents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). The problem states X is an analog with a heavier isotope, making **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** the most logical identity for X.\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (2Al(OD)₃) decomposes it to aluminum oxide and heavy water, D₂O (B).\n        *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 2: Performing the Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   We must sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   **One** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium). Its mass is 27.\n        *   **Four** atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium). Their total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of these values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
