    "The user wants to identify the fundamental symmetries that all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the foundation of SMEFT:** SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM). It is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). This foundational structure imposes certain constraints on the theory.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Lorentz Symmetry (1) and Poincare Symmetry (2):**\n    *   **Lorentz symmetry** (invariance under rotations and boosts) is a cornerstone of special relativity and, by extension, any relativistic QFT. The fields in the SM and SMEFT are defined by how they transform under the Lorentz group (scalars, spinors, vectors). The Lagrangian, which dictates the dynamics of the theory, must be a Lorentz scalar to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n    *   **Poincare symmetry** is the full group of spacetime symmetries in special relativity, including Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental requirement for a consistent relativistic QFT. The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group.\n    *   Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, both must be respected.\n\n3.  **Evaluate CP Symmetry (3):**\n    *   **CP symmetry** is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established experimentally that the weak interaction in the Standard Model violates CP symmetry (e.g., in the decay of neutral kaons and B mesons).\n    *   SMEFT is an extension of the SM, and it can introduce new sources of CP violation. Many higher-dimensional operators in the SMEFT basis are explicitly CP-violating.\n    *   Since the SM itself violates CP, and SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential new physics which could also violate CP, there is no requirement for all SMEFT operators to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **Evaluate CPT Symmetry (4):**\n    *   **CPT symmetry** is the combination of Charge Conjugation, Parity, and Time Reversal (T).\n    *   The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation.\n    *   SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT. Therefore, it must obey the CPT theorem. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be CPT-invariant. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of one of its core assumptions, like Lorentz invariance, which is a much more radical departure from established physics than what standard SMEFT describes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** Must be respected.\n*   **Poincare Symmetry (2):** Must be respected.\n*   **CP Symmetry (3):** Is not required to be respected.\n*   **CPT Symmetry (4):** Must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
