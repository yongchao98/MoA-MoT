    "An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation depend on the nature of the oscillation, which can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest orders of this expansion are the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Source:**\n    The problem describes \"an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This phrasing is key. It can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    a)  **Electric Dipole Model:** A charge distribution with a fixed spheroidal shape has charges oscillating within it, for example, along the z-axis. This creates an oscillating electric dipole moment `p(t)`. This is the simplest and most common type of radiation source.\n    b)  **Electric Quadrupole Model:** The shape of the charge distribution itself oscillates. For instance, a sphere deforms into a prolate spheroid, then back to a sphere, then to an oblate spheroid, and so on, along the z-axis. This type of oscillation has no changing dipole moment (the center of charge can remain fixed), but it has an oscillating electric quadrupole moment. This is a classic example of a quadrupole radiator.\n\n    Given that the options in the question correspond to the distinct results from these two models, it's likely a test of understanding the difference. The specific mention of a \"spheroid\" shape, which can deform, strongly suggests that the problem is about shape oscillations, pointing to the electric quadrupole model. If a simpler dipole was intended, a more generic description like \"a charge oscillating on the z-axis\" would have been sufficient.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Electric Quadrupole Model:**\n    For an oscillating electric quadrupole (like a spheroid oscillating between prolate and oblate forms along the z-axis), the radiated power has the following characteristics:\n\n    *   **Wavelength Dependence:** The radiated power is proportional to the square of the third time derivative of the quadrupole moment tensor. This leads to a power dependency on the angular frequency as `P ∝ ω⁶`. Since the wavelength `λ` is related to `ω` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`.\n\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** The radiated power per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for this type of axial quadrupole oscillation is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle with the axis of symmetry (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    Let the radiated power per unit solid angle be `f(λ, θ) = K * λ⁻⁶ * sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`, where `K` is a constant.\n    The maximum power, `A`, occurs at the angle `θ_max` that maximizes the angular term `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n\n    *   **Find the maximum of `g(θ)`:**\n        We can rewrite `g(θ)` using the double angle identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`:\n        `g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = ( (1/2)sin(2θ) )² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n        The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ_max = 45°`.\n        Therefore, the maximum value of `g(θ)` is `g(45°) = 1/4`.\n        The maximum power is `A = K * λ⁻⁶ * (1/4)`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the power at `θ = 30°`:**\n        We evaluate `g(θ)` at `θ = 30°`:\n        `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3 / 2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n        The power radiated at 30° is `f(λ, 30°) = K * λ⁻⁶ * (3/16)`.\n\n    *   **Find the fraction:**\n        The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n        Fraction = `f(λ, 30°) / A = (K * λ⁻⁶ * 3/16) / (K * λ⁻⁶ * 1/4) = (3/16) / (1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `3/4`.\n    The possible form of the function `f` shows a dependence on wavelength of `λ⁻⁶`.\n    These two results match option B.\n\nFor completeness, the electric dipole model would have yielded a power dependence of `λ⁻⁴` and an angular dependence of `sin²(θ)`. This would result in a maximum power at `θ = 90°` and a fraction of `1/4` at `θ = 30°`, corresponding to option C. However, the problem's specific wording makes the quadrupole model the more likely intended scenario.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# We analyze the electric quadrupole model, which is strongly suggested by the problem description.\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta) * cos^2(theta).\n# The power is also proportional to omega^6, which means it's proportional to lambda^-6.\n\n# Define the angular part of the power function\ndef angular_power_quadrupole(theta_deg):\n    theta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n    return (np.sin(theta_rad) * np.cos(theta_rad))**2\n\n# Calculate the power at the angle of interest, theta = 30 degrees\npower_at_30 = angular_power_quadrupole(30)\n\n# Find the maximum power.

    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The nature of this radiation depends on the multipole moment that is oscillating.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Radiation Type:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This is a key detail.\n    *   If it were a simple charge oscillating back and forth along the z-axis, it would be an **electric dipole** radiator.\n    *   However, the description of an oscillating *spheroid shape* (e.g., a sphere deforming into a prolate spheroid, then an oblate spheroid, and back) implies a change in the charge distribution's shape, not just its position. This type of oscillation corresponds to an **electric quadrupole** radiator. For such an oscillation, the dipole moment can remain zero if the center of charge is fixed.\n\n2.  **Properties of Electric Quadrupole Radiation:**\n    *   **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric quadrupole is proportional to the sixth power of the angular frequency (`P ∝ ω⁶`). Since wavelength `λ` is inversely proportional to frequency (`λ = 2πc/ω`), the power is proportional to `λ⁻⁶`. Therefore, the function `f` for power per unit solid angle will have a `λ⁻⁶` dependence.\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** For an axial quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is not uniform. It has an angular dependence given by:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle with the symmetry axis (the z-axis).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    Let the radiated power per unit solid angle be `f(θ) = K * sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`, where `K` is a constant that includes the `λ⁻⁶` term and other factors.\n\n    *   **Find the maximum power (A):** We need to find the angle `θ_max` where `f(θ)` is maximum. This is equivalent to maximizing the term `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n        Using the trigonometric identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`, we can rewrite `g(θ)`:\n        `g(θ) = (sin(θ)cos(θ))² = ( (1/2)sin(2θ) )² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n        The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1 (which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`).\n        Therefore, the maximum value of `g(θ)` is `1/4`.\n        The maximum radiated power is `A = K * (1/4)`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the power at θ = 30°:**\n        We evaluate `g(θ)` at `θ = 30°`:\n        `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3 / 2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n        The power radiated at 30° is `f(30°) = K * (3/16)`.\n\n    *   **Find the fraction:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of `f(30°)` to `A`:\n        Fraction = `f(30°) / A = (K * 3/16) / (K * 1/4) = (3/16) / (1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **3/4**.\nThe possible form of the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁶**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
