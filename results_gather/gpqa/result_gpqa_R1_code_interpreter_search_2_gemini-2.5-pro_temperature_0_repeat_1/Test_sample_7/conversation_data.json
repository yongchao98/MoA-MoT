As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` results in 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the plant's resistance to anthracnose.\n    *   The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance.\n    *   This pattern demonstrates **epistasis**. The phenotype of the `g2` mutation (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) mutations. When G2 is absent, the status of G1 or G3 becomes irrelevant to the resistance level.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. A TF is a master regulator. A knockout of a master TF that controls the entire resistance pathway would logically lead to a complete loss of resistance. Therefore, G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance, meaning it's responsible for 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25%).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance, meaning it's responsible for 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently and their effects were simply additive, the double mutant `g1g3` would be expected to lose the sum of the individual losses (25% + 50% = 75% loss), resulting in 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is 10% resistance, which corresponds to a 90% loss of resistance.\n    *   Since the observed effect in the double mutant (90% loss) is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss), this indicates a **synergistic interaction**. This type of interaction is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions. When only one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but when both are knocked out, the effect is much more severe.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the provided options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* Unlikely. G2 is the better candidate.\n        *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n        *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* This is correct, as the `g1g2` phenotype (0%) is the same as the `g2` phenotype (0%). However, the other parts of the statement are incorrect or unsupported.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This is our most likely conclusion.\n        *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* This is plausible if they are co-regulated by G2, but \"gene redundancy\" is a more direct description of their functional relationship based on the data.\n        *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct, as deduced from the epistasis data.\n        *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* Correct, as deduced from the synergistic effect in the double mutant.\n        *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This is incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n        *   Despite the final clause being incorrect, this option contains two correct and crucial conclusions drawn directly from the data.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n        *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Unsupported by the data. Gene redundancy is a better description.\n        *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Option C provides the most accurate description of the genetic relationships, even with an error in its third clause. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. No other option captures these two key findings as effectively. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
