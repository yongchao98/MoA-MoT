    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents on the benzene ring direct new incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to a benzene ring in an order that results in the desired 1,3,5-pattern with high yield.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction adds an acetyl group to benzene, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *Product: Acetophenone*\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position.\n    *Product: 3-Bromoacetophenone*\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and a bromo group at C3 (ortho, para-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. However, experimental data shows that this reaction yields the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product (around 58% yield), along with other isomers. While not perfectly selective, this is a viable route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv-vii) would modify this product and lead to a different molecule, suggesting they are extraneous or the question is structured to only consider the core synthesis path contained within the option. This sequence (i-iii) successfully produces the target compound.\n\n**Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** Forms bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** This produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n*   **Step iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The benzene ring is now substituted with two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. This step would fail or give a negligible yield. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming aniline. The -NH2 group is a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex (-NH3+) which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director. Assuming the reaction proceeds, it would yield 3-aminoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iv) 3-aminoacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The ring has a strongly activating *o,p*-directing amino group (-NH2) and a deactivating *m*-directing acetyl group (-COCH3). The powerful amino group will control the position of substitution, directing the bromine to positions 2, 4, and 6 (ortho and para to the amino group). This will not produce the desired 5-bromo isomer. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv):** This sequence (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) starts with benzene and converts it back to benzene. This is a nonsensical pathway. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B, C, and D contain steps that either fail or lead to the wrong products.\n*   Option A describes a sequence where the first three steps (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) constitute a known, viable synthesis for 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, yielding it as the major product. Although a more efficient synthesis exists (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination), it is not presented as an option. Given the choices, the sequence in A is the only one that leads to the desired product. The additional steps (iv-vii) appear to be superfluous information.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of reactions in option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
