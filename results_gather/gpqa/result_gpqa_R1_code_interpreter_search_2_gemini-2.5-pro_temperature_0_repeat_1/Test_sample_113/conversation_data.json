    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 1: CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must be a proton source.\n        *   Step 2: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion):** This is a strong acid source (typically from adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water). It is an excellent proton source to complete the reaction. In practice, the reaction is often carried out by adding a strong acid to an aqueous solution of NaCN, which generates HCN in situ, or by adding the acid in a final workup step. In either case, a source of H⁺ like H₃O⁺ is required.\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent also undergoes nucleophilic addition to carbonyl compounds, but it forms a bisulfite addition product. It is used for purification, not for cyanohydrin synthesis. It would compete with the cyanide ion.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates that water is the reactant, and B is the catalyst.\n        *   R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺)\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B (from the remaining choices A and B):**\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Strong acids are standard and effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds via protonation of the nitrile nitrogen, followed by nucleophilic attack by water, leading to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion. Strong mineral acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are required.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B should be a strong acid like HCl.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
