    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position 2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position 3: a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The arrangement of these groups is crucial and often difficult to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps (Retrosynthesis)**\n\n*   **Introducing -NO2 last:** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. The -OEt group (strong activator) would direct nitration to its para- (C4) and ortho- (C6) positions. The -tBu group would direct to its ortho- (C3, C5) positions. The powerful -OEt group would dominate, leading to nitration at C4 and C6, not C3. This route is unlikely to be high-yield.\n*   **Introducing -tBu last:** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally ineffective on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Furthermore, the bulky t-butyl group would likely add at the less sterically hindered C4 or C6 positions, not the crowded C2 position.\n*   **Introducing -OEt last:** This is typically done via Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. This seems like a plausible final step. The challenge is then to synthesize this specific phenol. Making this phenol with the 1,2,3-substitution pattern is non-trivial. For instance, nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would lead to substitution at the 4- and 6-positions, not the 3-position.\n\nGiven the difficulty in devising a straightforward synthesis, we must carefully analyze the provided options. The correct answer must consist of a sequence of chemically valid reactions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nLet's examine each option step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The substrate, a sulfonic acid, does not have an amino group. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> Aniline. (OK)\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. (Problematic step)\n    ...\n    vi) `SO3/H2SO4`: This step follows a diazotization (v). Attempting to sulfonate a diazonium salt under these conditions is not a standard or logical reaction. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of -NO2 -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (OK)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of -NH2 -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Attempting to nitrate a diazonium salt. **This step is chemically incorrect.** Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (major product). (OK)\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> p-tert-butylaniline. (OK)\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amino group and control the reaction, this step usually implies protection (e.g., acetylation to form N-acetyl-p-tert-butylaniline), followed by nitration, and then deprotection. The -NHAc group directs ortho, so the product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Plausible sequence)\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol (Sandmeyer reaction) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. (OK)\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis -> 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    viii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the resulting product. (A valid reaction)\n    ix) `dilute H2SO4`: Desulfonation. (A valid reaction)\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain steps that are chemically nonsensical in the given context. Option D, in contrast, presents a sequence where every single step is a valid and well-known organic reaction.\n\nWhile the product of step (vii) in Option D is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, this sequence is the only chemically coherent one among the choices. The final two steps (viii and ix) are redundant as written, but they do not invalidate the sequence. It is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt.\n\nGiven the choices, the only sequence that represents a valid multi-step synthesis is Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
