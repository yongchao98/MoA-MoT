    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find the Masses**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Now, we solve this system of equations:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2*m2` into the second equation: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (also known as the Q-value) is `T_total = T1 + T2`.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The total momentum before the fission equals the total momentum after.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `0 = p1 + p2`\n*   This means the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know `T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Also, total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the first equation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives us a useful relation for `(p*c)^2`:\n    *   `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n    *   `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n*   From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic value, `T1_rel`.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Convert the energies to MeV for the final comparison (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n    *   `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Calculate the difference:\n    *   `Difference = T1_rel - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n```python\n# Given values in GeV\nE0 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * E0\nm2c2 = 0.33 * E0\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nT_total = E0 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# In the classical limit, T is proportional to 1/m for the same momentum.\n# T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2 => T2 = 2*T1\n# T1 + T2 = T_total => T1 + 2*T1 = T_total => 3*T1 = T_total\nT1_classical_GeV = T_total / 3.0\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2\n# (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# With T2 = T_total - T1, we solve for T1.\n# A general formula derived from the above is:\n# T1 = (T_total * (T_total + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * E0)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = (T_total * (T_total + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * E0)\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The correct (relativistic) T1 is {T1_relativistic_GeV:.3f} GeV.\")\nprint(f\"The classical approximation for T1 is {T1_classical_GeV:.3f} GeV.\")\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\n```\n<<<\nThe correct (relativistic) T1 is 1.005 GeV.\nThe classical approximation for T1 is 1.000 GeV.\nThe difference is 5.0 MeV.\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Properties**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\n*   The total energy is conserved. The initial energy (all rest-mass energy) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released, `T_total = T1 + T2`, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. The fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n*   `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting gives `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, so `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since `E = T + m*c^2`, we can write `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   From momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`. This is the correct value for T1.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n*   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
