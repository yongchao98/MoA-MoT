    "*   **Goal:** The primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by \"knocking out\" the gene.\n\n*   **Types of Mutations and their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent (Synonymous) Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not result in an amino acid change in the protein. This usually has no effect on the protein's function.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This might alter the protein's function, make it non-functional, or have no effect at all. Its impact is often unpredictable without further testing.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon. This causes the ribosome to stop translation early, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame of the gene, changing every amino acid downstream of the mutation and often leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This results in the deletion or addition of one or more amino acids but does not change the reading frame. It may or may not disrupt protein function.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Mutations:**\n    Let's break down the intact gene sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and translate it. The start codon is `ATG`.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT... -3’\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\n    Now let's analyze each mutant in the same way and compare it to the intact gene.\n\n    1.  **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT... -3’\n        *   Change: `TTT` -> `TTC` (codes for Phe, same as `TTT` - silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (codes for Tyr, instead of Leu - missense mutation).\n        *   Effect: This results in a single amino acid change (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might disrupt the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n    2.  **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT... -3’\n        *   Change: `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    3.  **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT... -3’\n        *   Change: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense, Leu -> Tyr) and `ACT` -> `GTC` (missense, Thr -> Val).\n        *   Effect: This results in two amino acid changes. Similar to Mutant 1, this might disrupt function, but it's less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    4.  **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT... -3’\n        *   Change: Comparing to the intact sequence (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`), we see that the codon `GGT` has been deleted. There is also a change from `CTC` to `TAC`.\n        *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon (the protein loses a Glycine) and a missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr). Because the deletion is a multiple of three, the reading frame is preserved. The rest of the protein will be translated correctly, just missing one amino acid. This could disrupt function, but it is less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The most drastic and reliable mutation for knocking out a gene's function is the nonsense mutation found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced.\n\n<<<A>>>"
