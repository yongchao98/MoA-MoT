    "The user wants me to calculate the comoving distance to a quasar.\n\n**1. Identify the physical phenomenon:**\nThe problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a characteristic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. The drop in flux blueward of the peak is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, which is the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen clouds along the line of sight to the quasar. The peak itself corresponds to the redshifted Lyα emission from the quasar.\n\n**2. Determine the redshift (z):**\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is λ_rest = 121.6 nm.\nThe observed wavelength is λ_obs = 790 nm.\nThe redshift `z` is given by the formula:\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n\n**3. Formulate the comoving distance calculation:**\nFor a flat Lambda-CDM universe (as specified by Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1), the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating over the redshift:\nD_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\nwhere:\n*   D_H is the Hubble distance, D_H = c / H₀.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   H₀ is the Hubble constant at present day.\n*   E(z) is the dimensionless Hubble parameter: E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m,0 * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ,0).\n\n**4.

    "The user wants to determine the comoving distance to a quasar based on its spectral observations and a given cosmological model.\n\n**1. Identify the Physical Process and Calculate Redshift (z)**\n\n*   The problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at an observed wavelength (λ_obs) of 790 nm.\n*   It also mentions a significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than this peak. This is a characteristic feature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The drop in flux is caused by the \"Lyman-alpha forest,\" where intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the quasar's light at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line.\n*   Therefore, we can confidently assume that the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyα emission line.\n*   The rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nm.\n*   The redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\n    z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\n    z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n    z ≈ 6.4967 - 1\n    z ≈ 5.5\n\n**2. Determine the Formula for Comoving Distance**\n\n*   The problem specifies a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) model, which is consistent with the given density parameters (Ω_m = 0.3 and Ω_Λ = 0.7, since 0.3 + 0.7 = 1).\n*   For a flat universe, the comoving distance (D_C) to an object at redshift z is calculated by the following integral:\n\n    D_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\n    where:\n    *   D_H is the Hubble distance, defined as c / H₀.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   H₀ is the Hubble constant at the present day (z=0).\n    *   E(z) is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, given by:\n        E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m,0 * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ,0)\n\n**3. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\n*   We have all the necessary parameters:\n    *   z ≈ 5.5\n    *   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Ω_m,0 = 0.3\n    *   Ω_Λ,0 = 0.7\n    *   c ≈ 299,792 km/s\n\n*   This integral is complex and is best solved numerically.
