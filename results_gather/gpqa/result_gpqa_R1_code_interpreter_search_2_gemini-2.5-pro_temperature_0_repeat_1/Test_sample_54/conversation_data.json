    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   1H (from 7.0 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's check the number of protons in the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The formula is CH3COOCH=CHCH3. The number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The formula could be CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3 or CH3COOCH2CH=CHCH3. The number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal:**\nThe structure is propenyl acetate: CH3(d)-C(=O)-O-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c). Let's assign each signal to the protons in this structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** It's a singlet, meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is the characteristic region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O), specifically an acetate group. This corresponds to the **CH3(d)** protons.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** It's a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   This signal corresponds to the **CH3(c)** group, which is adjacent to the single proton **H(b)**.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** It's a doublet of quartets. This means the proton is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This signal corresponds to proton **H(b)**, which is coupled to **H(a)** across the double bond (doublet) and to the three protons of the **CH3(c)** group (quartet).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. The high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** It's a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This signal corresponds to proton **H(a)**, which is coupled to **H(b)**.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is the key to determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe coupling constant (J-value) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their geometric relationship.\n*   **Trans-protons:** Have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis-protons:** Have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant between the two vinylic protons (H(a) and H(b)) is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the integration confirms the compound is a propenyl acetate. The analysis of the splitting patterns confirms the connectivity. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms a trans geometry for the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
