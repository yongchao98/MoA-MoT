    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its 1H and 13C NMR spectra.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 7.71 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.08 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) is characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons in the alkyl region. This is likely a methyl group attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), as it's a singlet (no adjacent protons) and its chemical shift is typical for an aryl-CH3. This confirms a `p-tolyl` (para-methylphenyl) group.\n    *   `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`: Two doublets, each for 1 proton, in the alkene region (5-8 ppm). They are coupled to each other, indicating a `-CH=CH-` group. The large coupling constants implied by the wide separation of the signals suggest a trans configuration.\n    *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)`: Another singlet for 3 protons. This must be a methyl group with no adjacent protons. Given the 13C data below, this is likely a methyl ketone (`-C(=O)-CH3`).\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   `δ 144.1, 141.5, 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C)`: These six signals correspond to the 8 sp2-hybridized carbons of the p-tolyl group and the -CH=CH- double bond. The presence of two signals integrating to 2 carbons each (`129.1` and `126.9`) confirms the symmetry of the para-substituted ring.\n    *   `δ 28.4 (1C, s)` and `δ 21.3 (1C, s)`: These are the two methyl carbons. `δ 21.3` is typical for the methyl group on the p-tolyl ring, and `δ 28.4` is consistent with the methyl carbon of a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (`p-tolyl` group, `-CH=CH-` group, and a methyl ketone `C(=O)CH3`), the only logical structure is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    Structure: `(4-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all NMR data and has the molecular formula C11H12O, which is the same as the starting material, Compound X, as expected for a rearrangement reaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Determine Compound X**\n\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reaction involves heating an epoxide (Compound X, C11H12O) with a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO). This set of conditions is classic for the rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a C=C double bond) into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n*   **Mechanism (Working Backwards):** The product is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. This α,β-unsaturated ketone is formed from a vinyloxirane precursor. The base (DABCO) deprotonates the carbon atom that is alpha to both the vinyl group and the oxirane ring. This is followed by the opening of the epoxide ring to form a dienolate anion, which then tautomerizes to the final ketone product.\n\n    *   Product: `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This product arises from the tautomerization of the enol: `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH2`\n    *   This enol is formed by protonating the dienolate: `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(O-)=CH2`\n    *   This dienolate is formed by the rearrangement of the initial carbanion formed from the starting epoxide. The starting epoxide must have the `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-` vinyl group attached to an epoxide ring that can provide the `-C(=O)-CH3` fragment. The only epoxide structure that fits this is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`.\n\n*   **Identifying Compound X from the Options:**\n    The required structure for Compound X is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. Let's find the corresponding name in the options.\n    *   A \"styryl\" group is `phenyl-CH=CH-`.\n    *   A \"4-methylstyryl\" group (or p-methylstyryl) is `(4-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-`.\n    *   This group is attached to an oxirane ring (`-CH(O)CH2`).\n    *   The name is therefore **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n    This matches option C. Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect.\n    *   A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: `phenyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3)`. Would rearrange to an ethyl ketone with a phenyl group, not a methyl ketone with a p-tolyl group.\n    *   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: `phenyl-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. Would rearrange to `phenyl-CH=C(CH3)-C(=O)-CH3`. The product would have a trisubstituted double bond and a phenyl group, which contradicts the NMR data.\n    *   D) 2-styrylepoxide: `phenyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. Has the wrong molecular formula (C10H10O) and would give a product with a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
