    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl. The ratio of ³⁵Cl to ³⁷Cl is roughly 3:1. A compound containing one chlorine atom will show an M+ peak (containing ³⁵Cl) and an M+2 peak (containing ³⁷Cl) with a relative intensity ratio of approximately 100:33. The observed ratio of 100:32 is a strong indication that the molecule contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is consistent with a carbonyl group in a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H').\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate protons attached to a benzene ring.\n        *   We see two distinct signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm and a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Each signal integrates to two protons ('2H'), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This adds up to a total of four aromatic protons.\n        *   A benzene ring with two sets of two equivalent protons, where each set is a doublet, is the classic splitting pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, and the protons on the other side are equivalent. Each proton has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in two doublets.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    1.  From the IR and NMR, we know the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    2.  From the MS, we know it has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n    3.  From the NMR, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    4.  Combining these facts, the structure must be a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom in the *para* (position 4) position. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW = 156.5 g/mol (matches MS), is a carboxylic acid (matches IR), and is *para*-substituted (matches NMR). This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** *Ortho*-substitution would give a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two doublets.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm and would show an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
