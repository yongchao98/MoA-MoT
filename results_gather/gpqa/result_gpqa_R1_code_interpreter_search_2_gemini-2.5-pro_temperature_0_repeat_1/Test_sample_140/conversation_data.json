    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and the amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is slower.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n           (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. H is removed from C6. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. D is still at C2).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n          (Visualizing the process: Br at C1, D at C2. D is removed from C2. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne has no deuterium).\n\n**Stage 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 yields **aniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 also yields **aniline**.\n\n    So, Pathway B leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic molecules:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
