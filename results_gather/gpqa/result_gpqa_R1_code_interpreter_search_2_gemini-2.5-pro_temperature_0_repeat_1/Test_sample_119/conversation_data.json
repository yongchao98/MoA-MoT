    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   Let `ρ` be the number density of stars, which is the number of stars per unit volume. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, so `ρ` is a constant.\n    *   Let `d` be the distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   The parallax, `plx`, is defined as the inverse of the distance: `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From the parallax definition, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a given parallax interval `d(plx)`, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:**\n    *   Now, we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(1/plx²) * d(plx)` in our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying the terms:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   By rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
