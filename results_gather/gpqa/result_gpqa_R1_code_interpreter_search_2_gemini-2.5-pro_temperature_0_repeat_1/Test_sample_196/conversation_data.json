    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl group analysis:** Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group (an ethyl fragment part).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is likely a -CH₂ group adjacent to both the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the -CH at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is a -CH group. Its chemical shift suggests it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. The benzylic -CH group must be attached to both the methyl group (-CH₃) and the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) are unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer. The starting material has a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
