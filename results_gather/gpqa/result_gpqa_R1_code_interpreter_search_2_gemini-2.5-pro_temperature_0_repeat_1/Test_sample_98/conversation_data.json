    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\nThe most discriminating information comes from the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures (they are all saturated alkanoic acids).\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A `doublet` (d) implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   A `triplet` (t) implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n    *   A `quartet` (q) implies coupling to **three** equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A `doublet` (d) implies coupling to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   A `triplet` (t) implies coupling to **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   Another `triplet` (t) implies coupling to another, different set of **two** equivalent neighboring protons.\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtt` signal must be a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains both a proton in a `dtq` environment and a proton in a `dtt` environment. The key is to correctly determine the IUPAC name and structure from the condensed formulas, as the longest carbon chain is not always written linearly.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThe longest chain containing the COOH group is 5 carbons long. This molecule has a proton (`H` at C3) that is a `dtt`, but it does not have a proton that is a `dtq`.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\nThe longest chain is 5 carbons. This molecule has methine protons that would show as a doublet of triplets (`dt`), but it has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\nThe longest chain is 5 carbons. This molecule also has methine protons that would show as a doublet of triplets (`dt`), but it has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's determine the correct structure and IUPAC name for this compound. The formula is written as `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxylic acid carbon.\n\nLet's draw it out to visualize the chain:\n```\n      CH₃(a)\n      |\n      CH₂(b)\n      |\nCH₃(c)-CH(d)--CH(e)--CH₂(f)--COOH(g)\n             |\n             CH₂(h)\n             |\n             CH₃(i)\n```\nIf we trace the longest chain starting from the COOH carbon (g), we find the path g → f → e → d → b → a is 6 carbons long. This means the parent acid is **hexanoic acid**.\n\nNow, let's number this chain and identify the substituents:\n`C6(a)H₃-C5(b)H₂-C4(d)H-C3(e)H-C2(f)H₂-C1(g)OOH`\n*   On carbon 4 (`C4(d)H`), there is a methyl group (`-CH₃(c)`).\n*   On carbon 3 (`C3(e)H`), there is an ethyl group (`-CH₂(h)CH₃(i)`).\n\nSo, the correct IUPAC name for structure C is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\nNow let's analyze the key proton signals for 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n1.  **Proton at C4 (H(d)):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C3 (`H(e)`): 1H → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   The protons on C5 (`CH₂(b)`): 2H → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The protons on the methyl substituent (`CH₃(c)`): 3H → splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n    The resulting signal for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals given.\n\n2.  **Proton at C3 (H(e)):** This is also a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C4 (`H(d)`): 1H → splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   The protons on C2 (`CH₂(f)`): 2H → splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   The protons on the ethyl substituent (`CH₂(h)`): 2H → splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n    The resulting signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal given.\n\n### Conclusion\nStructure C, which is correctly identified as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only candidate that exhibits both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
