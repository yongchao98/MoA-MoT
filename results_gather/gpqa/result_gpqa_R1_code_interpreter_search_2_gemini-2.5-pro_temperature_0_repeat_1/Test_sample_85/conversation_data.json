    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The structure has a stereocenter at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n```\n      O=C(2)\n     /     \\\n  C(3)H2    O(1)  <-- Ring Oxygen\n  |         |\nC(4)H(Et)   C(6)H2  <-- Stereocenter at C4\n  \\         /\n   --C(5)H2--\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is a bit convoluted, but it describes the following structure, which is a mono-ester of a dicarboxylic acid.\n\n```\n      O                O\n     //               //\nHO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu   (where iBu = isobutyl)\n                    |\n                    Et  <-- Stereocenter at C3\n```\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an ester at the other end (C5). The stereocenter at C3 in the starting material will become the stereocenter at C4 in the lactone product. The reactions do not break any bonds at the stereocenter, so the spatial arrangement of the groups is maintained. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups changes, which could change the R/S designation.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to compare the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the stereocenter before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):**\n        1.  -CH₂-COOiBu (ester side)\n        2.  -CH₂-COOH (acid side)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Product (at C4):**\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O- (ring portion towards the carbonyl)\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O- (ring portion towards the ether oxygen)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (1 ↔ 2). Swapping two groups at a stereocenter inverts its configuration (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the reaction causes an inversion of the stereochemical descriptor, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-A → (R)-Product\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol at C1 attacks the ester at C5 to form the six-membered lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We use the same priority assignments as in step 3.\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of all groups are maintained in the same order. This means the reaction proceeds with retention of the stereochemical descriptor.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the reaction causes retention of configuration, to obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-B → (S)-Product\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
