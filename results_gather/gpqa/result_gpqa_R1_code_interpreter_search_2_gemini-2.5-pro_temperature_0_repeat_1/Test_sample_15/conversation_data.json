    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key features to look for are chiral centers and elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion), which would make a molecule achiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is essentially planar around the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It has no chiral centers (a carbon atom must be sp3-hybridized and bonded to four different groups to be a chiral center).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes absolute configuration descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This specifies the precise three-dimensional arrangement at two chiral centers. When a specific enantiomer is named (using R/S notation), it refers to the enantiomerically pure substance. Such a substance is chiral by definition (unless it's a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex, unsymmetrical structure). The presence of the `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` group further ensures the lack of symmetry that could make it meso.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is symmetric around the C2-C3 bond. It has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S). This is the definition of a meso compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It possesses an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion in its staggered conformation) that makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive** (it is a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configuration is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Since both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R), there is no internal symmetry that would cancel out the chirality. This molecule is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable. The name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH-, and -CH2-CH2-.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In this highly symmetric arrangement, the molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the CH2 group directly opposite it (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Furthermore, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers in this specific isomer because the paths around the ring from these carbons are identical in both directions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality.\n        *   The isobutyl group `(CH3)2CH-CH2-` has no chiral centers (C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon attached to the carbonyl group and the C-C bond opposite to it.\n        *   The entire molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups of the chain and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
