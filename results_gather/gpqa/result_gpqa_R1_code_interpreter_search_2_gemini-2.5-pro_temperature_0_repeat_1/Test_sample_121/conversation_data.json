    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction typically uses PBr3, this is a variation. The reaction substitutes a bromine atom for one of the alpha-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** CH3COOH -> BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH -> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN -> NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential alkylation followed by an intramolecular cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> [NCCHCOOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion (enolate) attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining, now less acidic, alpha-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH -> [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a stable six-membered ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler type reaction.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ethoxycarbonyl group. This plane of symmetry makes the following pairs of carbons and their attached protons chemically related:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nWe must consider the protons in their distinct chemical environments. For a substituted cyclohexane ring, we must consider axial and equatorial positions, as they are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The question asks for the number of \"chemically distinct hydrogens,\" which implies we should not assume rapid conformational averaging (which would make axial and equatorial protons equivalent on the NMR timescale).\n\nLet's count the distinct proton signals:\n\n1.  **Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry in the molecule. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard achiral NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. On each carbon, there is an axial (ax) and an equatorial (eq) proton. H2-ax and H2-eq are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes H2-ax enantiotopic to H6-ax, and H2-eq enantiotopic to H6-eq. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to two distinct signals: one for the two axial protons and one for the two equatorial protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similar to C2/C6, the four protons on these two equivalent carbons give rise to two distinct signals: one for the two axial protons and one for the two equatorial protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. It has one axial and one equatorial proton. These two protons are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different chemical environments. They are diastereotopic. Therefore, they give two separate signals. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C1:** This carbon has no protons attached.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up all the distinct proton environments:\n1 (from -CH3) + 1 (from -OCH2-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
