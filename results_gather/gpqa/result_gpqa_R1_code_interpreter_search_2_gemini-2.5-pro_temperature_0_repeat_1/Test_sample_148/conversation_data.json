    "*   **Analysis of the Observations:**\n    1.  **1H NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two different species in the sample. The similar chemical shifts imply that the two species are structurally very similar.\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species that have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by chromatography. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This means the two species are isomers of each other (they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms).\n    3.  **Temperature Effect:** The LC-MS was run at an \"elevated temperature.\" This is a key piece of information. In peptide chemistry, a common source of isomerism is the restricted rotation around the amide (peptide) bond. This leads to the existence of *cis* and *trans* rotamers (or atropisomers). The interconversion between these isomers is often slow on the NMR timescale at room temperature, leading to separate sets of peaks. The energy barrier to this rotation can be high enough that the isomers can also be separated by HPLC, especially if the interconversion is slow on the chromatography timescale. The rate of interconversion is temperature-dependent. The fact that two peaks are still observed at elevated temperature suggests a significant energy barrier to rotation.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would have a different chemical structure and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both components have the same mass as the final product.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same molecular formula and mass but different 3D arrangements.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers are chemically distinct and will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers would have slightly different chemical shifts. This matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. They have the same mass. This perfectly matches the LC-MS observation.\n        *   The *cis/trans* rotamers discussed above are a specific type of diastereomer (atropodiastereomers). Another possibility is that one of the chiral amino acids used in the synthesis was not enantiomerically pure, leading to the formation of epimers (e.g., an L-L peptide and a D-L peptide), which are also diastereomers. Both scenarios fit the definition of a diastereomeric mixture and are consistent with all the analytical data.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a different chemical structure and a higher mass than the expected product. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are indistinguishable and produce a single set of peaks. Similarly, they cannot be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column. Therefore, this explanation contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass), are separable by LC, and show distinct NMR signals is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the most plausible explanation that fits all the provided data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
