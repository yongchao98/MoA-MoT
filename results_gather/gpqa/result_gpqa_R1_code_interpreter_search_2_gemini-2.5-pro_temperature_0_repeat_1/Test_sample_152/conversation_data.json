    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and the carbonyl π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The β-carbon of the acrylate is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`\n    *   Let's analyze the names provided in the options. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" implies a propane (C3) backbone. Let's number it C1-C2-C3. The substituents are: two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups at C1, a p-tolyl group at C2, and one methoxycarbonyl group at C3. This corresponds to the structure `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂(COOCH₃)`. This matches our derived product structure. The alternative name, \"trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate\", would imply a different connectivity (`(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(COOCH₃) - CH₂(p-tolyl)`), which would not be the result of a Michael addition.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophilic equivalent of the enolate of cyclohexanone. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the original ketone.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C-C bond. This results in an intermediate iminium ion and a carbanion stabilized by the nitrile group.\n    *   The carbanion is protonated.\n    *   The final step is the acidic workup (H₃O⁺), which hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group, regenerating the ketone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The reaction attaches a substituent to the α-carbon (C2) of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile. The fragment added is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN]cyclohexanone`.\n    *   Let's name this product. The main chain can be considered the butanenitrile. The chain is `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`. The substituent is at C3 and is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is generally more stable than the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), especially after acidic workup.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns and Unknowns:**\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C is the unknown.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   The product is formed by adding a substituent to a parent molecule. The parent molecule is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, attached at the C2 position.\n    *   The Michael addition of a nucleophile to MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) results in the addition of the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   This means the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the parent molecule, cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 5.2) due to being flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The option `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione` represents a gem-diol (hydrate), not the starting dicarbonyl compound.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
