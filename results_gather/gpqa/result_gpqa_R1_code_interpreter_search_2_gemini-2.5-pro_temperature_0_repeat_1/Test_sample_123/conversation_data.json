    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than their proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in their own rest frame) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity `v`, which is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is `N / N₀`. We can find this by substituting the time of flight (`t_lab`) and the dilated lifetime (`τ_lab`) into the decay law:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    Let's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `A = R / (c * τ₀)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-A / γ)`\n\n5.  **Applying the Given Conditions:** We have two scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n        Plugging these into our simplified equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-A / 20)`\n        To solve for `A`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n        `A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        Using the same equation with the value of `A` we just found:\n        `2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)`\n        `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n        Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculation:** To get a precise numerical value, we can use a short python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\ngamma1 = 20.0\n\n# Derived relationship: gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n# This is equivalent to gamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1851131118532\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.19.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 68\n\nThe value 54 is the closest match to our calculated result of 54.19.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor of `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of them reach it.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in a specific reference frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particles in that same reference frame.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame vs. Particle Frame:** We are observing the decay from the lab's frame of reference.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector (radius `R = 30 m`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n        `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    *   The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, `τ_lab`, is dilated relative to their proper lifetime `τ₀` (their lifetime in their own rest frame). This is described by the time dilation formula:\n        `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n        where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** Substituting `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    We can group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `k = R / (c * τ₀)`. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n4.  **Applying the Given Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these values in: `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   Plugging these values in: `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    From Scenario 1, we can solve for the constant `k`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for `k` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides again:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Multiply by -1:\n    `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the properties of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, the denominator can be simplified:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) 28\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 68\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
