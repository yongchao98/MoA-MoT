    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We dilute this by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution:\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n    *   New Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.025 M.\n*   So, the solution we are titrating is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Titration Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is between a weak acid (acetic acid, HA) and a strong base (NaOH).\n*   CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   The net ionic equation is: HA + OH⁻ → A⁻ + H₂O (where A⁻ is the acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻).\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   This means the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻), which forms a buffer.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3).\n*   Let's compute the exact value.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Initial moles of HA = 0.001 mol.\n*   First, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). The solution now contains sodium acetate (NaA).\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water:\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH by calculating the [OH⁻] produced by this hydrolysis.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   V_total = V_diluted_acid + V_NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at this point:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / (50.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.02 M.\n*   Calculate the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate from the Ka of acetic acid:\n    *   Ka × Kb = Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of A⁻ to find [OH⁻] (let [OH⁻] = x):\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = Kb × 0.02\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb × 0.02).\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\n**5. Computation using Python**\n\nTo get the precise numerical answers, let's perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Initial moles of acetic acid (HA)\n# Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.020 L\nmoles_HA = 0.05 * 0.020\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point\n# Volume = Moles / Molarity = moles_HA / 0.1 M\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_HA / 0.1  # in Liters\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# V_total = V_diluted_acid + V_NaOH_eq = (0.020 L + 0.020 L) + vol_NaOH_eq\nvol_total_eq = 0.040 + vol_NaOH_eq\n\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\n# Moles of A- formed = initial moles of HA\nconc_A_minus = moles_HA / vol_total_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis of A-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Concentration after dilution:**\n    *   The initial volume of acid (20.00 cm³) is added to 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   New Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration begins with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to base (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains (HA).\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.25** (The code provides a more precise value of 4.26)\n\n### **3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (A⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n\n*   **Reaction:** A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Initial moles of HA = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of acetate [A⁻] at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles of A⁻ / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of A⁻:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻], we can approximate [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) )\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>"
