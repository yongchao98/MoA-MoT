    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** The average distance a particle travels between collisions. It's a fundamental concept in the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** The effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n*   **Relationship:** The mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n### 2. Define the Two Scenarios\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different mean free paths in the same sample compartment:\n\n*   **λ1 (Molecule-Molecule):** The mean free path of the remaining gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule):** The mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n\nIn both scenarios, the gas conditions (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same. This means the **number density of gas molecules (`n_gas`) is the same** for both calculations. Therefore, the comparison between λ1 and λ2 boils down to a comparison of their respective effective collision cross-sections.\n\nλ1 ∝ 1 / σ_gg  (gg = gas-gas)\nλ2 ∝ 1 / σ_eg  (eg = electron-gas)\n\nThis means: **λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nWe will use the standard hard-sphere model, which is a common and effective approximation for this type of problem. Let's assume the gas molecules are spheres with a diameter `d`.\n\n**a) σ_gg (Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section):**\n\n*   This is the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another identical gas molecule.\n*   For a collision to occur between two spheres of diameter `d`, their centers must approach within a distance `d`. This defines a circular target area with a radius `d`.\n*   The cross-section is σ = π * (radius)² = π * d².\n*   However, in a gas, the target molecules are also moving. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion increases the collision frequency, which is equivalent to using an effective cross-section that is larger by a factor of `sqrt(2)`.\n*   So, the effective cross-section for calculating the mean free path λ1 is:\n    **σ_gg = sqrt(2) * π * d²**\n\n**b) σ_eg (Electron-Gas Collision Cross-Section):**\n\n*   This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n*   The electron is a subatomic particle, and its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule. We can treat it as a point particle.\n*   The electrons in a 1000 kV TEM are moving at nearly the speed of light (v ≈ 0.94c), while the gas molecules at room temperature are moving much, much slower. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets.\n*   For a point particle (the electron) to collide with a spherical target of diameter `d` (or radius `r = d/2`), the point particle's trajectory must pass through the circular area presented by the sphere.\n*   The cross-section is the area of this circle:\n    **σ_eg = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4**\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the mean free paths using the ratio of the cross-sections we found:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg\nλ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * π * d²) / ( (π * d²) / 4 )\n\nThe `π * d²` terms cancel out:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) / (1/4)\nλ2 / λ1 = 4 * sqrt(2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value:\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.414\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nOur analysis shows that the mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). This is because the effective collision cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is much smaller than the effective cross-section for two molecules hitting each other.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our result (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1):\n\n*   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Our result (5.66 * λ1) satisfies this condition.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our result is much larger than 1.22 * λ1.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n\nThe only option consistent with the physical model is A. The electron, being a small and fast particle, is less likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is. This results in a longer mean free path for the electron.\n\n<<<A>>>"
