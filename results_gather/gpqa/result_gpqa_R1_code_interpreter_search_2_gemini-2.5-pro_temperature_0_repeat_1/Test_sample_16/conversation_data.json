    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that was prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02$ M.\n    *   The formation constant for the complex, $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n3.  **Relate the formation constant to the dissociation constant:** The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$).\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]}$\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n    | Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    | $CaY^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n    | $Y^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression using the equilibrium concentrations:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.** The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$, where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA anion) dissociates into its constituent ions. The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction.** We are given the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex:\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium due to the dissociation of the complex. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x.**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This means the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, we can assume that 'x' is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.
