    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) - 0/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the NMR data.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the formula, this is very likely a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is typical for N-H protons due to exchange and quadrupolar broadening.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to two protons. This corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amino group) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   Treating an aromatic diazonium salt with water and heat results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a common method for synthesizing phenols.\n    *   The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The -OH group on C3 and the acidic α-proton on C2 are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically favorable.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:**\n    *   The dehydration of the aldol addition product, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should be hydroxylated, and the double bond should be at the 2-position (α,β-unsaturated).\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect. This is not a dimerization product.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: **Correct.** This matches the structure derived from the self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Incorrect. This is the aldol addition product *before* dehydration. Given the reaction is heated, the dehydrated condensation product is the expected final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
