    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Principle of Dimensional Analysis in QFT**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [x]^4$. Since momentum has dimension of mass ($M^1$) and position is its conjugate variable, position has dimension of inverse mass, $[x] = M^{-1}$. Therefore, $[d^4x] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels out $M^{-4}$.\n$[S] = [\\mathcal{L}] [d^4x] = M^0$\n$[\\mathcal{L}] \\cdot M^{-4} = M^0 \\implies [\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian, which must also have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$):** The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The dimensions of $\\psi$ and its adjoint $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same: $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}]$.\n    *   So, for the kinetic term: $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$.\n    *   $[\\psi]^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4 \\implies [\\psi]^2 = M^3 \\implies [\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   For this term to have a mass dimension of $M^4$, we must have:\n    *   $[F_{\\mu\\nu}][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n    *   Since raising or lowering indices with the metric tensor does not change the mass dimension, $[F_{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]$.\n    *   $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n*   **Sigma tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices, their commutator is also a dimensionless matrix.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must also be $M^4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found for each component:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$\n\nCombine the powers of M:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n\nSolve for $[\\kappa]$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** Coupling constant has a positive mass dimension ($[g] > 0$).\n*   **Renormalizable:** Coupling constant is dimensionless ($[g] = 0$).\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** Coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[g] < 0$).\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. Since the dimension is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nThis type of interaction is an example of a \"higher-dimension operator\". The operator $\\mathcal{O} = \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5$. Any interaction term with an operator of dimension greater than 4 will have a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension, leading to a non-renormalizable theory. Such theories are typically interpreted as effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
