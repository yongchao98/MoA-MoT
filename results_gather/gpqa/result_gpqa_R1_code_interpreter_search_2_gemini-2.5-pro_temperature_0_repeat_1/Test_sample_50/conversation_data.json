    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`. It is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n*   A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We must have `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition.\n*   We need to find the potential energy of this entire system. The potential energy is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, i.e., to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the grounded sphere.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced surface charges, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`) is zero. For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy `U`.\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work an external agent must do to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to its final position (`x = d`). This is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_e(x) dx`\n\nWhere `F_e(x)` is the electric force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. By the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'(x)` at its corresponding position `b(x)`.\n\n*   At a distance `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'(x)` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   The force on `q` is:\n    `F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_e(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the potential energy:\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula\n\nThe energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nWe can find `V_induced` by calculating the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   Location of `q`: distance `d` from the center.\n*   Location of `q'`: distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n*   Potential at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ - (k * q * R) / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
