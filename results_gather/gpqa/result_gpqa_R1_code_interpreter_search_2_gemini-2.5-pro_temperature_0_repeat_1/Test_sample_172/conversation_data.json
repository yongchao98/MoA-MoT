    "This problem requires us to connect the uncertainty in an electron's position to the uncertainty in its energy. This is a classic application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, but it requires a few steps.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):**\n\nThe core principle we'll start with is the position-momentum uncertainty relation:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nFor the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the equality:\nΔp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nHowever, for order-of-magnitude estimates, it's common to use the approximation:\nΔp ≈ ħ / Δx\n\nLet's use the latter for simplicity, as the options are separated by orders of magnitude.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe electron is traveling at v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, which is two-thirds the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s). At such high speeds, we must use the relativistic formula for energy:\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\nwhere:\n*   E is the total energy.\n*   p is the momentum.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Connecting Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp) to Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nTo find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE), we can differentiate the energy equation with respect to momentum:\nd(E²)/dp = d/dp [ (pc)² + (m₀c²)² ]\n2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c²\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nFrom relativistic mechanics, we also know that E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for dE/dp:\ndE/dp = ( (γm₀v)c² ) / ( γm₀c² ) = v\n\nThis gives us a direct relationship: dE = v * dp.\nWe can approximate the differentials (dE, dp) with the uncertainties (ΔE, Δp) for small uncertainties:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n\nNow we can combine the steps to calculate ΔE.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    *   Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δp ≈ ħ / Δx = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    *   Given: v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ΔE ≈ v * Δp = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\n    *   ΔE ≈ 2.108 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n# Given values\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\n# delta_x * delta_p >= hbar / 2\n# For estimation, we can use delta_p ≈ hbar / delta_x\ndelta_p = hbar / delta_x\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in energy\n# For a relativistic particle, the relation between energy and momentum uncertainty is dE/dp = v\n# So, delta_E ≈ v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.2e} J\")\n```\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.11 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe result clearly matches the order of magnitude of option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n*   The problem involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This immediately suggests using the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**.\n*   The electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, while c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), so we must use **relativistic mechanics** to relate energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe position-momentum form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the equality, but for an order-of-magnitude estimate, the approximation Δp ≈ ħ / Δx is sufficient and commonly used.\n\nGiven:\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nCalculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp ≈ ħ / Δx\nΔp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Relate Energy and Momentum for a Relativistic Particle:**\nThe total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the energy-momentum relation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nTo find how a small change in momentum (Δp) affects the energy (ΔE), we can differentiate this equation with respect to momentum (p):\nd(E²)/dp = d/dp [ (pc)² + (m₀c²)² ]\n2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c²\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nFrom the definitions of relativistic energy (E = γm₀c²) and momentum (p = γm₀v), we can substitute to find that dE/dp = v.\nTherefore, for small uncertainties, we can use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**4. Calculate the Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can substitute the values we have:\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 2.108 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Compare with the given options:**\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.11 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
