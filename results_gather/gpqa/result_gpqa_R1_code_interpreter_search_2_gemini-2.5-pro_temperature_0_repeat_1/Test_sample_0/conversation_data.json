    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n**2. Relate the Principle to the Problem**\n\n*   The lifetime (τ) of an unstable quantum state can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt) for which the state exists. So, Δt ≈ τ.\n*   This lifetime imposes an uncertainty, or \"width,\" on the energy level of the state. This is often called the natural linewidth. We can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n*   For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2). A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths:\n\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**\n\nWe need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) to get the energy uncertainty directly in eV.\n\n*   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty.\n\n**4. Apply the Resolution Condition**\n\nTo clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:\n\n*   Required Energy Difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n*   Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Required Energy Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nAlternatively, a simpler and more common condition is that the separation must be at least larger than the broader of the two lines, which is ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nWe need to find an option that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than the required difference)\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is 1000 times larger than the required difference, so they would be very clearly resolved)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, given their lifetimes.\n\n```python\n# Define the reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (delta_E ~ hbar / tau)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The minimum energy difference to resolve the states is approximately the sum of their linewidths\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (delta_E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (delta_E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required minimum energy difference to resolve (delta_E1 + delta_E2): {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough to resolve the states.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough to resolve the states.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (which we can take as the lifetime of the state, τ), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime τ has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy level, given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state.**\n\n*   **For the first state:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved.**\n\nFor two energy levels to be distinguishable, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A common criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines) is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the sum of their individual widths.\n\nRequired Energy Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum required energy difference.**\n\n*   Minimum Difference ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Minimum Difference ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum Difference ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined energy widths of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
