    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be S. This is the \"stationary\" frame from our perspective.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be S'. This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time because it's measured by a clock at rest within the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame, we need to know the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Step 5.1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 5.2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5.3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 5.4: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   Now, let's compute the final value using a python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s, velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy\ndt_prime = 50  # s, time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time)\nc = 300000  # km/s, speed of light\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (time dilation)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n3061862\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option B.\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer in classical physics, `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is approximately 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- The time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) must be longer than the time in the moving frame (ejecta). This is time dilation.\n- The distance measured in the stationary frame is the velocity multiplied by this dilated time.\n- The calculation `d = v * (γ * Δt')` is correct.\n- The numerical result confirms that option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
