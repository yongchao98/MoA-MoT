    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of an aromatic ring. Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will preferentially add to the positions ortho (C2, C6) or para (C4) to the methyl group.\n*   Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* product is formed in a higher yield than the *ortho* product. We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene (or p-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent. It is capable of oxidizing an alkyl group attached to a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), provided there is at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the ring (a benzylic hydrogen). The methyl group in 4-nitrotoluene has three benzylic hydrogens. The nitro group is resistant to these oxidizing conditions.\n*   Therefore, the methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** We have three components: an acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid), a strong base (NaOH), and a ketone (acetone). The most favorable and rapid reaction that will occur is the acid-base neutralization between the carboxylic acid and the strong base.\n    *   `4-NO₂-C₆H₄-COOH (acid) + NaOH (base) → 4-NO₂-C₆H₄-COONa (salt) + H₂O (water)`\n*   In this context, acetone serves as a solvent for the reaction. While acetone can form an enolate in the presence of NaOH, a subsequent reaction with 4-nitrobenzoate is unlikely under these conditions. A nucleophilic attack on the aromatic ring is difficult without better leaving groups or more activating groups, and other condensations are not favorable. Thus, the simplest and most plausible reaction is neutralization.\n*   **Product 3:** Sodium 4-nitrobenzoate.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of the product. For an ionic compound like sodium 4-nitrobenzoate, we analyze the symmetry of the anion, the 4-nitrobenzoate ion.\n*   **Structure:** The 4-nitrobenzoate ion has a benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at position 1 and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 4 (para to each other).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Let's identify the symmetry elements of the 4-nitrobenzoate ion, assuming the molecule is planar.\n    1.  **C₂ axis:** There is a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C1 and C4 atoms of the benzene ring.\n    2.  **Perpendicular C₂ axes:** There are two other C₂ axes perpendicular to the first one. One lies in the plane of the molecule, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the ring.\n    3.  **Mirror Planes (σ):** There are three mirror planes. One is the plane of the molecule itself. The other two are perpendicular to the molecular plane and contain the C₂ axes.\n    4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a center of inversion at the geometric center of the benzene ring.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses a principal C₂ axis, two perpendicular C₂ axes, three mirror planes, and a center of inversion belongs to the **D₂h** point group. This is a common point group for para-disubstituted benzene rings with substituents that are themselves symmetric, such as p-xylene or terephthalic acid.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is sodium 4-nitrobenzoate. The 4-nitrobenzoate anion has D₂h symmetry. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) d2h - Correct.\n*   B) c2h - The molecule has higher symmetry than C₂h.\n*   C) cs - The molecule has higher symmetry than Cₛ.\n*   D) c3 - The molecule does not have a C₃ axis.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular symmetry group is D₂h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
