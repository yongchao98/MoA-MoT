    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n    *   We will assume particle X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion), so its total angular momentum `j_X` is equal to its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check each potential reaction against three rules:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_final_total`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    *   For `J_final_total` to be 0, we must be able to couple `J_f` and `l_X` to get 0. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative orbital motion) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   Setting `P_initial = P_final`: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This equation holds true only if the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` is an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final State:**\n    The problem provides a specific constraint from Pauli statistics for the final NN state.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The rule is `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n4.  **Physicality of the NN State:**\n    A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these four conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **NN Validity:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`-wave: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **NN Validity:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (OK)\n4.  **NN Validity:** `S_f=3`. This is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`-wave: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f=0`.\n4.  **NN Validity:** `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nBoth options C and D describe forbidden transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons. This is a fundamental issue with the definition of the state itself.\n*   Option D is forbidden because the combination of quantum numbers for the final state (`S_f=1, L_f=1, T_f=0`) violates the specific Pauli statistics rule given in the problem. The state `3P0` is a valid NN state, but not with `T=0`.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and \"Pauli statistics\". The violation in option D is found precisely by applying these rules, particularly the Pauli constraint. The violation in option C is found by a more basic principle (spin addition) not explicitly listed in the instructions. Therefore, option D is the intended answer as it tests the specific rules provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
