    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n### 2. Physical Interpretation\nIn experimental particle physics, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the particle's production point from its decay point. This requires the particle to travel a distance (its track length) that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution.\n\nTherefore, the problem is asking for the minimum distance `d` (the resolution) such that at least 30% of the particles travel this distance *or more* before they decay.\n\n### 3. The Physics of Particle Decay\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The fraction of particles that have *not* decayed after traveling a distance `x` in the lab frame is given by:\n$P(x) = e^{-x/L}$\nwhere $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nWe want the fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more to be at least 30%. So, we set:\n$P(d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for `d`, we get:\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length `L` depends on the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) and its velocity ($v$).\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime is dilated.\n    *   First, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy} (m_0c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by:\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    We can express the velocity $v$ in terms of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} \\implies v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Substituting this into the equation for $L$:\n    $L = \\left(c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\\right) \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n### 5. Calculation\nNow we can substitute the given values into the formulas.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s (speed of light)\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # s\nc = 299792458.0  # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame\n# L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (d)\n# We need to find d such that the probability of the decay length being > d is 30%\n# P(decay_length > d) = exp(-d/L) = 0.30\n# d = -L * ln(0.30)\nd = -L * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{d}\")\n```\n\n### 6. Result and Conclusion\nThe execution of the code yields the following result:\n2.2681055...e-06\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference (~9%) is likely due to rounding of the input values used when creating the problem and options. The other options are different by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In the context of a particle detector like a bubble chamber, \"observing\" a decay means that the particle travels a distance (its track length) that is long enough to be resolved by the detector. Therefore, we need to find the distance `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel this distance or more before they decay.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Resolution to Decay Probability\n\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance `x` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n$P(x) = e^{-x/L}$\nwhere $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nWe want the fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more to be at least 30%. This corresponds to the survival probability at distance `d`. So, we set up the equation:\n$P(d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for the distance `d` (which represents the required resolution), we get:\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)\n\nThe mean decay length `L` depends on the particle's speed and its lifetime in the lab frame. Due to relativistic effects (time dilation), the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy in the lab frame ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\nThe mean decay length `L` is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It can be calculated using the formula:\n$L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formulas.\n- Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n- Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n- Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n- Speed of Light, $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame\n# The formula is L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d)\n# We need to find d such that the probability of the decay length being >= d is 30%\n# The probability is given by P(decay_length >= d) = exp(-d/L)\n# So, exp(-d/L) = 0.30\n# Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -d/L = ln(0.30)\n# Solving for d: d = -L * ln(0.30)\nd = -L * np.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution is: {d:.3e} m\")\n```\nThe code calculates the required resolution `d` based on the derived formulas. The output of the code is approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given multiple-choice options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in value and identical in the order of magnitude to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference is likely due to rounding of the input values used when creating the problem. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This means we need to find the minimum distance, `d`, that the particle must travel before decaying, such that this happens for at least 30% of the particles.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Decay Probability\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying in the lab frame is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/L}$\nwhere $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nWe are given that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we need to find the distance `d` (the resolution) for which the probability of the particle traveling at least this distance is 0.30.\n$e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-d/L}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$-d/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)\n\nThe mean decay length `L` is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. This distance depends on the particle's lifetime in the lab frame and its velocity. Since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, its lifetime is dilated.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is related to the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$, by the time dilation formula:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe mean decay length is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$):\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nWe can express the velocity $v$ in terms of $\\gamma$ as $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Substituting this gives a more direct formula for $L$:\n$L = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Values and Calculate\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n- $E = 27$ GeV\n- $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n- $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n- $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n1.  **Calculate $\\gamma$**:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.91788$\n\n2.  **Calculate $L$**:\n    $L = (2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.91788)^2 - 1}$\n    $L \\approx (2.3983 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.6928 - 1}$\n    $L \\approx (2.3983 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{61.6928}$\n    $L \\approx (2.3983 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.8545$\n    $L \\approx 1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Calculate $d$**:\n    $d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d \\approx -(1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe code execution from the previous step confirms this calculation, yielding $d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.
