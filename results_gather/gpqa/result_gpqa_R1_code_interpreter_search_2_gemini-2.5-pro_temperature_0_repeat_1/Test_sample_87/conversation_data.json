    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation 1:** Some protein is lost in the stomach and mucus. This is context, indicating the antigen successfully reached the intestines.\n    *   **Observation 2:** Fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses to gut antigens. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has been taken up by cells in these structures.\n    *   **Observation 3:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from the Peyer's patches. This points to clonal expansion of lymphocytes (likely B cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Observation 4 (Key Finding):** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options in the Context of the Key Finding:**\n    The question is about what process causes high variability in the *variable heavy chain gene* of *proliferating B cells* in a *secondary lymphoid organ* after antigen exposure.\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). It does *not* introduce variability into the *variable* region. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially assembles the variable region gene from V, D, and J gene segments. This occurs in the bone marrow during the development of naive B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen encounter. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system's effector functions. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins and has no role in altering the genetic sequence of B cell receptors. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to a foreign element. It occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). During the proliferation that follows antigen stimulation, the genes encoding the variable regions of the antibodies undergo a very high rate of point mutations. This process is specifically designed to create \"high variability\" in the variable region, allowing for the selection of B cells with higher-affinity antibodies (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the experimental observations: proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ showing high variability in their variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The process described is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
