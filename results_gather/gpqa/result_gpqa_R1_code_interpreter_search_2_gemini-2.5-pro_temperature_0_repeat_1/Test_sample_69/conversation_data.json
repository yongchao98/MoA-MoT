    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given chemical reactions and clues.**\n\nWe are given four reactions and several descriptive clues:\n1.  **Solid A + 8 equivalents Gas B → Bright red product C**\n2.  **C + 2 equivalents Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n3.  **C + H₂O → A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)**\n4.  **D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the simpler reactants and products first.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4 (D + B → H)** is a good starting point. It's a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n    CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) is a known solvent and was used as a chemical weapon. Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n*   **Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis of C)** provides strong clues. The products are the regenerated solid A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.\n    *   If B is Cl₂, then the strong acid F formed during hydrolysis is very likely **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis also produces a weak acid G. The reaction is: C + H₂O → A + HCl + G.\n    *   The regeneration of A is a crucial clue. It suggests that A is a stable component of C that is released upon reaction. The most chemically sound explanation for the formation of both a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a chloride-containing compound (C) is the disproportionation of chlorine itself in water:\n        Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid)\n    *   This implies that the hydrolysis of C releases Cl₂ molecules, which then react with water.\n    *   So, we can identify: **F = HCl** and **G = HClO**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify compound C based on its formation and hydrolysis.**\n\n*   For the hydrolysis of C to release Cl₂ and regenerate A, C must be an adduct or a complex salt where A is a stable core and Cl₂ molecules (or a polyhalide equivalent) are attached.\n*   Let's look at **Reaction 1**: A(s) + 8B(g) → C(red).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we get: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n*   This 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly matches the idea that C is an adduct of A with 8 molecules of chlorine, i.e., **C = A·(Cl₂)₈**. Alternatively, if A is a salt like [Cation]Cl, then C could be a polychloride salt [Cation]⁺[Cl₁₇]⁻. In either case, C acts as a carrier for 8 Cl₂ molecules per unit of A.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction would then be: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 8H₂O → A(s) + 8HCl + 8HClO. This perfectly matches the products A, F, and G.\n*   The problem states C is a \"bright red product\". While simple chlorine adducts are not typically red, large polychloride or polyhalide ions can be brightly colored. We will assume this description holds for our proposed compound C.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the hazardous product E.**\n\n*   Now we analyze **Reaction 2**: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous).\n*   Substituting our identified C and D: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → E.\n*   The reactive part of C is the stored chlorine molecules. Carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with chlorine (Cl₂) to form phosgene (COCl₂).\n    Cl₂ + CO → COCl₂\n*   The problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (CO). This is the most difficult clue to reconcile perfectly. Many chemical riddles contain slight inaccuracies or simplifications. If we assume that the reaction produces phosgene, the stoichiometry might be simplified in the problem statement. The most plausible hazardous product formed from a chlorine carrier (C) and carbon monoxide (D) is phosgene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n*   Phosgene is notoriously hazardous, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous product\". It was used as a chemical warfare agent in WWI.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   We have identified E as phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to analyze its 3D structure.\n*   The phosgene molecule is planar, with a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E)**: All molecules have this.\n    2.  **C₂ axis**: There is a two-fold rotational axis passing through the C=O double bond. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    3.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ)**: There is a mirror plane that contains all three atoms (C, O, Cl, Cl), i.e., the plane of the molecule.\n    4.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ')**: There is a second mirror plane, perpendicular to the first one, that contains the C₂ axis (i.e., it contains the C and O atoms and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with the symmetry elements E, C₂, σᵥ, and σᵥ' belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step deduction, the hazardous product E is phosgene (COCl₂). The molecular symmetry group for phosgene is C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
