    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and States:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons.\n    *   They are in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. In a more common notation, this is simply $|l, m> = |2, -1>$.\n    *   This state $|l, m>$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator squared, $L^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$.\n    *   The eigenvalues are $L^2 |l, m> = l(l+1)\\hbar^2 |l, m>$ and $L_z |l, m> = m\\hbar |l, m>$.\n    *   For our state $|2, -1>$, the eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that if we measure the total z-component of the angular momentum, we will *always* get the value $-\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    *   We are performing a joint measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting the specific outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Connect the States using the Total Angular Momentum Operator:**\n    *   The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Let's see what the eigenvalue of $L_z$ is for the measurement outcome state $|-1, -1>$.\n    *   $L_z |-1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |-1, -1>$\n    *   $= L_{1z}|-1, -1> + L_{2z}|-1, -1>$\n    *   Since $|-1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, we have:\n    *   $= (m_{l1}\\hbar)|-1, -1> + (m_{l2}\\hbar)|-1, -1>$\n    *   $= (-1\\hbar)|-1, -1> + (-1\\hbar)|-1, -1>$\n    *   $= -2\\hbar |-1, -1>$\n    *   This shows that the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome, $|-1, -1>$, is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's initial state onto the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.\n    *   Initial state: $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l=2, m=-1>$\n    *   Outcome state: $|\\psi_{outcome}> = |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$\n    *   Probability $P = |<\\psi_{outcome}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<-1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   We have established that $|\\psi_{initial}>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   We have also established that $|\\psi_{outcome}>$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product (the projection) must be zero: $<\\psi_{outcome}|\\psi_{initial}> = 0$.\n    *   The probability is then $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The system is in a state where the total z-component of angular momentum is definitively $-1\\hbar$. The measurement outcome being considered ($m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$) corresponds to a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. It is impossible for a system with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$ to be found in a state with a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. Thus, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\nThis can also be seen through the lens of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. A non-zero coefficient $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ exists only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied. In this problem, $m=-1$, and for the desired outcome, $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
