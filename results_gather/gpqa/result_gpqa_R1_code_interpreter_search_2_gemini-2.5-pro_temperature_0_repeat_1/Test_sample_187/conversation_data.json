    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter (assumed from \"interatomic distance\"): `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial angles: `α = β = γ = 30°`\n    *   Miller indices of the plane: `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Distance:**\n    The general formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a crystal system is quite complex. For a rhombohedral system, where `a = b = c` and `α = β = γ`, the formula simplifies. The general formula is:\n    `1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a² * (1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the specific case of the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`.\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\n    Substituting these values into the numerator of the formula:\n    Numerator = `3 * sin²(α) + 2 * 3 * (cos²(α) - cos(α))`\n    Numerator = `3sin²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Using the identity `sin²(α) = 1 - cos²(α)`:\n    Numerator = `3(1 - cos²(α)) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Numerator = `3 - 3cos²(α) + 6cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Numerator = `3 + 3cos²(α) - 6cos(α)`\n    Numerator = `3 * (1 - 2cos(α) + cos²(α))`\n    Numerator = `3 * (1 - cos(α))²`\n\n    The denominator of the general formula can be factored as:\n    Denominator = `a² * (1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) = a² * (1 - cos(α))² * (1 + 2cos(α))`\n\n    Now, substitute the simplified numerator and the factored denominator back into the `1/d²` equation:\n    `1/d_111² = [ 3 * (1 - cos(α))² ] / [ a² * (1 - cos(α))² * (1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\n    The `(1 - cos(α))²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system:\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ a² * (1 + 2cos(α)) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Interplanar Distance:**\n    Now, we can plug the given values into this simplified formula.\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]`\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]`\n\n    To find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n    `d_111² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3`\n    `d_111 = √[ (100 * (1 + √3)) / 3 ]`\n    `d_111 = 10 * √[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]`\n\n    Now, we can use the numerical value `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `d_111 = 10 * √[ (1 + 1.732) / 3 ]`\n    `d_111 = 10 * √[ 2.732 / 3 ]`\n    `d_111 = 10 * √[ 0.91067 ]`\n    `d_111 = 10 * 0.9543`\n    `d_111 ≈ 9.54` Angstrom\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0  # degrees\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for d_111: d^2 = a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\n\n# Calculate d\nd = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n```output\n9.54297463812115\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of a rhombohedral crystal system:**\n*   The primitive lattice vectors have equal length: `a = b = c`.\n*   The angles between the primitive lattice vectors are equal: `α = β = γ ≠ 90°`.\n\n**2. Identify the given parameters:**\n*   Lattice parameter `a = 10` Angstrom.\n*   Interaxial angle `α = 30°`.\n*   Miller indices of the plane `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n**3. Recall the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:**\nThe general formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a crystal with lattice parameters `a, b, c` and interaxial angles `α, β, γ` is given by:\n`1/d_hkl² = (1/V²) * [ (h²b²c²sin²α) + (k²a²c²sin²β) + (l²a²b²sin²γ) + 2hk(abc²(cosαcosβ - cosγ)) + 2kl(a²bc(cosβcosγ - cosα)) + 2lh(ab²c(cosγcosα - cosβ)) ]`\nwhere `V` is the volume of the unit cell:\n`V = abc * sqrt(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2cosαcosβcosγ)`\n\nFor a rhombohedral system, `a = b = c` and `α = β = γ`. The formula simplifies significantly.\nThe volume `V` becomes:\n`V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`\nAnd the formula for `1/d_hkl²` becomes:\n`1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n**4. Simplify the formula for the specific plane (111):**\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\nNumerator: `3sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα) = 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\nUsing the identity `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`:\nNumerator: `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 - 3cos²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n\nDenominator: `a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`\nThis can be factored as `a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nNow, let's combine the simplified numerator and denominator:\n`1/d_111² = [ 3(1 - cosα)² ] / [ a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\nThe term `(1 - cosα)²` cancels out, leaving a much simpler expression:\n`1/d_111² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the numerical value:**\nInvert the formula to solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111² = [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ] / 3`\n`d_111 = sqrt[ (a²(1 + 2cosα)) / 3 ] = a * sqrt[ (1 + 2cosα) / 3 ]`\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866`\n\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[ (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[ (1 + √3) / 3 ]`\n\nUsing the numerical values:\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[ (1 + 1.73205) / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[ 2.73205 / 3 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[ 0.91068 ]`\n`d_111 = 10 * 0.95429`\n`d_111 ≈ 9.5429` Angstrom\n\nThis result was confirmed by the Python code execution, which gave `9.542974...`.\n\n**6. Compare with the options:**\nA) 10.05 Angstrom\nB) 8.95 Angstrom\nC) 9.54 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of `9.54` Angstrom matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
