    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Stellar Brightness**\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux `F`) emitted per unit area of a star's surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (`T`):\n`F ∝ T^4`\n\n**2. Model the Star's Brightness Variation**\n\nThe star has two distinct hemispheres: one is unspotted, and the other has 20% of its area covered by cooler spots. As the star rotates, we observe it from a fixed direction, seeing either the unspotted face or the spotted face. This causes a variation in the total observed brightness.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature `Teff`, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to `Teff^4`. We can set this as our reference brightness.\n    `F_max ∝ Teff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This face is a composite of two regions:\n    *   The normal photosphere, covering `1 - f` of the area, with temperature `Teff`.\n    *   The dark spots, covering a fraction `f` of the area, with temperature `Tspot`.\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is the weighted average of the flux from these two components.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Brightness Variation**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness states.\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 2:\n`Amplitude = (Teff^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4]) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude = (Teff^4 - Teff^4 + f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude = (f * Teff^4 - f * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Star's effective temperature, `Teff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `Tspot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n\n**4. Relate the Spot Signal to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe problem asks for the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal. When an exoplanet transits (passes in front of) its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\nWe need to find the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` that makes the transit depth equal to the amplitude calculated from the starspots.\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow we solve for `Rpl / Rstar`:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4))`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nTeff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the signal is equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)^2\n# So, (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = amplitude\n# Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nTeff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of the signal is equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)^2\n# So, (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = amplitude\n# Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius}\")\n</execute_code>\n<execution_result>\nThe calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3217921033933301\n</execution_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218.
