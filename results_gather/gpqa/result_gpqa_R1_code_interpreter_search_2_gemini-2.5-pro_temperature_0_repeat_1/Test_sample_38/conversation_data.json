    "This is a problem of quantum mechanics, specifically about the normalization of a wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe wave function `ψ(x)` describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding the particle in a small interval `dx` around a position `x` is proportional to `|ψ(x)|^2 dx`.\nThe term `|ψ(x)|^2` is called the probability density.\n\nThe given wave function is a complex number:\n`ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n\nTo find the probability density `|ψ(x)|^2`, we need to calculate the square of its magnitude. For any complex number `z = R + I*i`, the square of its magnitude is `|z|^2 = R^2 + I^2`.\n\nIn our case:\n*   The real part is `R = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n*   The imaginary part is `I = -0.5`\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n`|ψ(x)|^2 = (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (-0.5)^2`\n`|ψ(x)|^2 = a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n**2. The Normalization Condition**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are *always* found between `x=1` and `x=3`. This means the total probability of finding the particle in this region must be 1 (or 100%). Mathematically, this is expressed by the normalization condition:\n\n`∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1`\n\n**3. Setting up and Solving the Integral**\n\nNow we substitute our expression for `|ψ(x)|^2` into the integral:\n\n`∫[from 1 to 3] (a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\nWe can solve this integral step-by-step:\n`∫ (a^2 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx = 1`\n`a^2 * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + 0.25 * ∫ dx = 1`\n\nThe integrals are:\n*   `∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = ln(1 + x)`\n*   `∫ dx = x`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from x=1 to x=3:\n`[ a^2 * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ]` from 1 to 3 = 1\n\nEvaluate at the upper limit (x=3):\n`a^2 * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a^2 * ln(4) + 0.75`\n\nEvaluate at the lower limit (x=1):\n`a^2 * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a^2 * ln(2) + 0.25`\n\nSubtract the lower limit from the upper limit:\n`(a^2 * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a^2 * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1`\n`a^2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c)`:\n`a^2 * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1`\n`a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow we solve the equation for `a`:\n`a^2 * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n`a^2 * ln(2) = 0.5`\n`a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n`a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a\n# a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\nThe output of this code is `0.84932639...`.\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The core principle here is the normalization of the wave function. In quantum mechanics, the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|^2`, represents the probability density of finding a particle at a position `x`. Since the particle must be found *somewhere* within its allowed region, the integral of this probability density over that entire region must equal 1 (which corresponds to a 100% probability).\n\n**1. Determine the Probability Density Function**\n\nThe given wave function is a complex number:\n`ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n\nThe probability density is the square of its magnitude, `|ψ(x)|^2`. For a complex number `z = R + I*i`, the square of the magnitude is `|z|^2 = R^2 + I^2`.\n\n*   Real part (R): `a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n*   Imaginary part (I): `-0.5`\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n`|ψ(x)|^2 = (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (-0.5)^2`\n`|ψ(x)|^2 = a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nWe are told the particles are only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n`∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1`\n\nSubstitute the expression for the probability density:\n`∫[from 1 to 3] (a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n`∫[from 1 to 3] (a^2 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1`\n\nLet's solve each part. The antiderivative of `1/(1+x)` is `ln(1+x)`, and the antiderivative of `0.25` is `0.25x`.\n\n`[ a^2 * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ]` evaluated from `x=1` to `x=3` equals 1.\n\nNow, evaluate at the limits:\n*   At `x=3`: `a^2 * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a^2 * ln(4) + 0.75`\n*   At `x=1`: `a^2 * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a^2 * ln(2) + 0.25`\n\nSubtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\n`(a^2 * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a^2 * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1`\n`a^2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c)`:\n`a^2 * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1`\n`a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n\n**4. Isolate and Calculate 'a'**\n\nNow, we solve for `a`:\n`a^2 * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n`a^2 * ln(2) = 0.5`\n`a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n\nFrom the code execution, we know that `ln(2)` is approximately `0.693`.\n`a^2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215`\n`a ≈ sqrt(0.7215)`\n`a ≈ 0.849`\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
