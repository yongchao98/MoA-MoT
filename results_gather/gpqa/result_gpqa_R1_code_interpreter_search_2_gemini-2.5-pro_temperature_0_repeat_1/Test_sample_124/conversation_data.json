    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical System**\n\nThe problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, depending only on the radial distance $r$. This can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\n**2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi(x, y, z) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \\psi(x, y, z) = E \\psi(x, y, z)$$\n\nBecause the potential is a sum of terms depending on $x$, $y$, and $z$ independently, the equation is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators:\n$$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nTherefore, the total energy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$$\n$$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\n\n**3. Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of $n$:\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — 3 states\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — 6 states\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n\nThe total number of combinations (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$$\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
