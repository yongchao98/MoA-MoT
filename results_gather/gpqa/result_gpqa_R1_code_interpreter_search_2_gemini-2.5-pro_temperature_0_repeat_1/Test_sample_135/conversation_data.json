    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f` over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field and Volume:**\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n        `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n        where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that bounds the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    *   `V` is the volume of the sphere.\n    *   `S` is the surface of the sphere (a spherical shell of radius `R`).\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward from the surface.\n\n    *Why use the Divergence Theorem?* The vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. Directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` at the origin is problematic (it involves a Dirac delta function). The Divergence Theorem allows us to bypass this issue by converting the volume integral into a surface integral on the boundary of the sphere, where `r=R` and the field is well-behaved.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere of radius `r`, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = r^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`. The direction is radially outward, which is why we use `r_hat`. Since our surface is at a constant radius `R`, we have:\n        `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`\n    *   **Vector Field `f` on the Surface:** We evaluate the field `f` on the surface `S`, where `r = R`:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n    *   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   **Integrate over the Surface:** The final step is to integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Definite Integral:**\n    We can separate the integral into two parts:\n    *   The integral with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   The integral with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Multiplying the results:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is `4π`, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
