    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principles of conservation of energy in a relativistic system.**\n    In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy and its rest mass energy, $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. The kinetic energy is given by $K = E - mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n    When the particle is in a conservative force field, like the one described by Hooke's Law, there is also a potential energy $U(x)$. The total energy of the system, which is conserved, is the sum of the particle's energy and the potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\n2.  **Define the potential energy for the harmonic oscillator.**\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is the integral of the force, which is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Set up the energy conservation equation.**\n    The total energy $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ must be constant throughout the motion of the oscillator. We can evaluate this constant energy at a convenient point. The most convenient points are the points of maximum displacement (the turning points) and the equilibrium position.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy is: $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   Let the Lorentz factor at this speed be $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy is: $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate the expressions for total energy and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at $x=A$ is equal to the total energy at $x=0$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Then, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n    *   A) is dimensionally incorrect.\n    *   B) would result in a speed greater than c, which is impossible.\n    *   C) is the non-relativistic limit, not the general relativistic solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
