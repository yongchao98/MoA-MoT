    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two different compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Molar Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR signals for each of the four options. The key factors are chemical equivalence (determined by symmetry) and spin-spin coupling (n+1 rule for simple cases).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a pair).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n        *   **Prediction:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6H (for C1/C3) : 3H (for C2) : 3H (for C5), which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple.\n        *   **Prediction:** A multiplet (specifically, an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals are from the two equivalent ethyl groups.\n        *   The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH3 groups. Prediction: One quartet (4H).\n        *   The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH2- groups. Prediction: One triplet (6H).\n        *   The aliphatic spectrum consists of a quartet and a triplet, **not singlets**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options Based on the NMR Data**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\nThe spectrum shows **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   This immediately rules out any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, as it does not produce an aromatic singlet. Therefore, options **C** and **D** are incorrect.\n*   This also rules out any combination that doesn't produce a 1:1 ratio. Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Option B (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a 4H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:4H, which is **1:2**. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the aromatic region alone, **Option A** is the only possibility.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis (Confirmation):**\nLet's confirm that Option A also matches the aliphatic data: **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Total Aliphatic Protons:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n*   **Expected Signal Integrals:** A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the three signals must integrate to:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n*   **Signals from Individual Compounds:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n*   **Combining the Signals:** To get the observed spectrum (three signals of 12H, 6H, 6H), the following must occur:\n    1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one of the observed signals.\n    2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second observed signal.\n    3.  The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB must have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called accidental isochrony), thus appearing as a single combined signal integrating to 3H + 3H = **6H**. This is the third observed signal.\n\nThis combination perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
