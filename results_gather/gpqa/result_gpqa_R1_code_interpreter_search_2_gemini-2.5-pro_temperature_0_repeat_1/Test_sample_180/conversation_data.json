    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Baseline Solar Neutrino Spectrum\n\nFirst, we need to know which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos and at what energies. The main sources relevant to the energy bands in question are:\n\n*   **pp-II Chain:** The electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ`) produces monoenergetic neutrinos. The vast majority (about 90%) are emitted at **861 keV**.\n*   **pp-III Chain:** The beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ`) produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** The beta decays of Nitrogen-13 (`¹³N`) and Oxygen-15 (`¹⁵O`) produce neutrinos with continuous energy spectra, with maximum energies of 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The **pp-III branch stops**. This means the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases**.\n*   This happened ~8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth. So, we observe the consequences of this stoppage *now*.\n*   All other reactions, including the pp-II chain (producing `⁷Be` neutrinos) and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n### 3. Determine the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the Change\n\nWe need to identify which neutrino sources contribute to each energy band under this new condition.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos are at 861 keV, so they do **not** contribute to this band.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos are gone because the pp-III branch has stopped.\n    *   Therefore, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle** (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decays).\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The dominant contributor is the monoenergetic **`⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV**, which falls squarely within this band.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos are gone.\n    *   The **CNO cycle** also contributes a small amount of flux from its continuous spectrum in this range.\n\n### 4. Estimate the Flux Magnitudes and Calculate the Ratio\n\nNow, let's compare the magnitudes of the fluxes in each band. We can use data from the Standard Solar Model for this.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The total flux from the `⁷Be` line is enormous, approximately **Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**. Since this is a line source, its entire flux is concentrated in this band.\n    *   The flux from the CNO cycle in this 100 keV-wide band is a small fraction of its total flux and is negligible compared to the `⁷Be` flux.\n    *   Therefore, **Flux(Band 2) ≈ Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹**.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The flux here is solely from the CNO cycle. The total flux from the main CNO sources (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is approximately **Φ(CNO) ≈ 5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹**.\n    *   This total flux is spread over an energy range of about 1.7 MeV. To get the flux in our 100 keV (0.1 MeV) wide band, we need to take a fraction of the total. As a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, we can assume the flux is somewhat evenly distributed.\n    *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ Φ(CNO) * (Bandwidth / Total Spectrum Width) ≈ (5 x 10⁸) * (0.1 MeV / 1.5 MeV) ≈ 3.3 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹.\n    *   A more precise look at the CNO spectrum shows the flux density is around 2-3 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹MeV⁻¹. Multiplying by the 0.1 MeV bandwidth gives a flux of **Flux(Band 1) ≈ 2-3 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹**.\n\n*   **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ (3 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 0.006\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.006. Looking at the options:\nA) 1\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 10\n\nThe value 0.006 is closest in order of magnitude to **0.01**. The key takeaway is that the flux in Band 2 is dominated by the very strong `⁷Be` line (~10⁹), while the flux in Band 1 comes from a small slice of the much weaker CNO continuum (~10⁷). The ratio is therefore on the order of 10⁷/10⁹ = 10⁻².\n\n<<<B>>>"
