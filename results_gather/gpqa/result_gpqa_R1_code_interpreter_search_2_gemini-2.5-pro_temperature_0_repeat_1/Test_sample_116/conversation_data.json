    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The steric hindrance caused by these large groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   A molecule that is chiral due to restricted rotation about a single bond is called an atropisomer. Atropisomers are a type of optical isomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   An atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center or an asymmetric center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and is bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* configuration around the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
