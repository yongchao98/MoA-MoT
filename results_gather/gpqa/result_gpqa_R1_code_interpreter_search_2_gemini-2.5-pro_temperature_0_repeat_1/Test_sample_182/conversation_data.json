    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure Breakdown:**\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n    *   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n    *   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Carbon atoms (C):\n        *   6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n        *   Total C = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms (H):\n        *   Let's count them on the structure:\n            *   C1 (attached to COOH and C2): 1 H\n            *   C2 (attached to CHO and C3): 1 H\n            *   C3 (part of C=C): 1 H\n            *   C4 (part of C=C): 1 H\n            *   C5 (attached to vinyl group and C6): 1 H\n            *   C6 (CH₂ group): 2 H\n            *   -COOH group: 1 H\n            *   -CHO group: 1 H\n            *   -CH=CH₂ group: 3 H\n        *   Total H = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 7 + 5 = 12.\n    *   Oxygen atoms (O):\n        *   2 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   Total O = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n    Alternatively, we can count the rings and pi bonds in the structure:\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the formyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a very strong reduction reaction. Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   The saturated ring structure itself is stable and does not break under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   Applying the reductions to the reactant:\n    *   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring is reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond becomes a C-C bond).\n    *   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n    *   The **formyl group** at C2 is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n    *   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The resulting product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cycloalkane. The carbon skeleton is conserved. So, the number of carbon atoms is still 10.\n    *   The product is a fully saturated cycloalkane derivative. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   For n = 10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n    *   This IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring (the cyclohexane ring) in the molecule. The molecule contains no other double or triple bonds.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction reduces all double bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups, but leaves the ring structure intact. The final product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (C₁₀H₂₀), which has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1 due to its cyclic structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
