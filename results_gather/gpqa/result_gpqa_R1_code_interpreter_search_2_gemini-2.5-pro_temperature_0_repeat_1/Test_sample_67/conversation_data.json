    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y`. This Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the system.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. Since the new Hamiltonian `H` is time-independent, the state at a later time `t` is given by:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` will have the same frequency as the oscillation of `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenstates (Bohr Frequency)**\n    *   A quantum system in a superposition of two energy eigenstates, `E_1` and `E_2`, will have its expectation values oscillate at an angular frequency `ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = |E_2 - E_1| / ħ`.\n    *   Let's find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian, `H = -γB S_y`. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H` are:\n        *   `E_1 = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_2 = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It is a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. (Specifically, `|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2`).\n    *   Because the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the system will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference `ΔE`.\n    *   `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Direct Calculation (Larmor Precession)**\n    *   This problem describes Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field direction (`Y-axis` in this case) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   Initially, the spin vector points along the Z-axis: `<S(0)> = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n    *   Under the influence of the Y-directed magnetic field, this vector will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n    *   The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis will be:\n        `<S_z(t)> = |<S(0)>| cos(ω_L t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine oscillation. By comparing it to the standard form `A cos(ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
