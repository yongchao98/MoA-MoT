    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and will cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) term will also cancel out.\n\nAfter cancellation, the formula simplifies significantly:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nWe are given data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v_r / c\nThe maximum radial velocity is the semi-amplitude of the RV curve, denoted as K. So, K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max.\nK ∝ Δλ_max\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\nwhere:\n- M_p is the planet's mass.\n- M_star is the star's mass.\n- G is the gravitational constant.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on from our perspective, meaning the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula becomes:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe need to solve this for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1 using the formula for `a`:\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (K_2^2 * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (K_1^2 * M_star)]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\nWe have:\n- M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  => M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7\n- Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å => Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25/49) * (9/16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a_2 / a_1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nlambda_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes squared (a_2 / a_1) is (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_1/K_2)^2\n# K_1/K_2 = lambda_1/lambda_2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (lambda_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(T_eq_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<\n0.5357142857142857\n>>>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the full expression:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio**\nSeveral terms in the equation cancel out based on the information given in the problem:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are identical for both and cancel out.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the term (1 - A)^(1/4) also cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' within the square root also cancels.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nWe are not given the semi-major axes directly, but we have information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. For a planet in a circular orbit, K is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\nwhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nThe problem states that the planets were detected using the transit method, which means their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe need to solve this equation for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1 using the expression for `a`:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2) ]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) observed (K ∝ Δλ_max). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\n**7. Substitute the Given Values**\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  => M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å => Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\nNow, calculate a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25/49) * (9/16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a_2 / a_1 back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
