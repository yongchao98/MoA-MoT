    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given and is very close to Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition (e.g., the same ratio of iron, silicate rock, etc.), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger self-gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly. Increased compression means that the material occupies less volume for its mass, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this \"Super-Earth\" will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass has weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression of its materials compared to Earth. Less compression means the material is less compact, leading to a lower overall density. This \"sub-Earth\" will be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **Compare the densities:**\n\n    *   Density of planet (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of planet (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression)\n    *   Density of planet (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    By comparing the four options, the planet described in (c) will have the highest density because its greater mass causes the most significant gravitational compression of its materials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
