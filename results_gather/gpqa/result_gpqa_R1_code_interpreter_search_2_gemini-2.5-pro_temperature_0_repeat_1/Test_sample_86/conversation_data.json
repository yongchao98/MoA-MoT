    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR data:**\n        *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n        *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) attached directly to the ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider the possibilities for the second substituent:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very plausible candidate.\n        *   **Acetaldehyde group attached via a methylene bridge (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is another plausible candidate.\n\n3.  **Assemble Possible Molecular Structures:**\n    *   **Structure A: Haloacetophenone.** This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). The total formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   **Structure B: (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.** This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen (-X) and a -CH2CHO group. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   All the plausible options (B and D) show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons (2H). This `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)` pattern is characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. This simplifies our analysis, as we can assume the two substituents are opposite each other on the ring.\n\n5.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Plausible Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: para-Haloacetophenone (Structure A)**\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to the para-substitution, they form two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two doublets. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the aromatic protons will be deshielded (shifted downfield) into the ~7.5-8.0 ppm range.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl, not to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n        *   **Matching Option:** Option **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)** is a perfect match for this prediction. It has the para-aromatic pattern in the correct region and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl group.\n\n    *   **Case 2: para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure B)**\n        *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The proton of an aldehyde group is highly deshielded and appears as a singlet (or a narrow triplet) in a very characteristic region, far downfield, around **9.5-10.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2CHO):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. They would appear as a singlet (or a doublet) around **3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** We would still expect two doublets for the para-substitution. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is now insulated from the ring by a -CH2- group. Its deshielding effect on the ring is weaker than in Structure A. Therefore, the aromatic protons should appear at a lower chemical shift (more upfield) compared to haloacetophenone, typically in the ~7.1-7.4 ppm range.\n        *   **Matching Option:** Let's examine **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**.\n            *   The aldehyde proton at 9.9 ppm and the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm are consistent with this structure.\n            *   **However, the aromatic shifts at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield.** These values are not consistent with the weaker deshielding effect of a -CH2CHO group. They are characteristic of a carbonyl group *directly* attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The data in option B is entirely consistent with the structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n    *   The data in option D is internally inconsistent. While the aldehyde and methylene signals match para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde, the aromatic signals do not. They are more appropriate for para-haloacetophenone.\n    *   Therefore, the only chemically correct and consistent option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
