    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right) = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n        $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Using the formula from step 2 and the values calculated in steps 4 and 5:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which matches option A.\n\nTo be certain, we can verify the calculations using a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# We can set h_bar to 1 and multiply it back in the final result.\nh_bar = 1.0\n\n# The state vector of the system\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# The matrix for the operator P_z\nPz = h_bar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z\n# <P_z> = psi_dagger * P_z * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.T.conj()\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the matrix for the operator P_z^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2\n# <P_z^2> = psi_dagger * P_z^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty delta_Pz\n# delta_Pz = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2)\n\n# The result is in units of h_bar\n# 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.7071\nprint(f\"The expectation value of Pz is: {exp_Pz} * h_bar\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value of Pz^2 is: {exp_Pz_squared} * h_bar^2\")\nprint(f\"The uncertainty in Pz is: {uncertainty_Pz} * h_bar\")\n```\nThe code confirms the manual calculation. The expectation value of $P_z$ is 0, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $0.5 \\hbar^2$, and the uncertainty is $\\sqrt{0.5} \\hbar \\approx 0.7071 \\hbar$, which is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<A>>>",
