    "This is a multi-step chemistry problem involving stoichiometry, solubility equilibrium, and pH calculations. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n### **1. Stoichiometry of the Dissolution Reaction**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs when iron(III) hydroxide, a base, dissolves in a strong acid. A strong monobasic acid (like HCl) provides H+ ions that neutralize the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation tells us that for every 1 mole of solid Fe(OH)₃ that dissolves, 3 moles of H⁺ ions are consumed.\n\n### **2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve.\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar mass of O + Molar mass of H)\n    *   Molar mass of Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol\n\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n### **3. Determine the pH of the Final Solution**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be considered \"dissolved,\" the ion product of its dissolution reaction must be less than or equal to its solubility product constant (Ksp). To find the *minimum* amount of acid, we assume the final solution is saturated, meaning the ion product equals the Ksp.\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n*   **Find the Ksp value:** The solubility product constant for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of Fe³⁺:** The 0.0009357 moles of Fe(OH)₃ are dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n*   **Calculate the required hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:** We rearrange the Ksp expression to solve for the maximum [OH⁻] that can exist in the solution without causing precipitation.\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (2.79 × 10⁻³⁹) / 0.009357\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = 2.982 × 10⁻³⁷\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.982 × 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.68 × 10⁻¹³ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 × 10⁻¹³) = 12.18\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is **1.82**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid serves two purposes:\n1.  To neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ according to the stoichiometry (Step 1).\n2.  To create the final acidic environment (the excess H⁺) determined by the final pH (Step 3).\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for neutralization:**\n    *   From stoichiometry, Moles H⁺ = 3 × Moles Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol\n*   **Moles of excess H⁺ in the final solution:**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻pH = 10⁻¹⁸² = 0.01514 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = 0.01514 mol/L × 0.1 L = 0.001514 mol\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles for neutralization) + (Moles of excess H⁺)\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.001514 = 0.004321 mol\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**\n    *   The acid has a concentration of 0.1 mol/L.\n    *   Volume (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration = 0.004321 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04321 L\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.04321 L × 1000 cm³/L = **43.21 cm³**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH is 1.82 and the required volume of acid is 43.21 cm³. Comparing these values to the given options:\n\nA) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the calculated values. This discrepancy often arises in textbook problems due to the use of slightly different constants (molar masses, Ksp) or rounding during intermediate steps. Let's re-evaluate using the pH from option A (2.04) to see if it yields the corresponding volume.\n\n*   **If pH = 2.04:**\n    *   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 (neutralization) + 0.000912 (excess) = 0.003719 mol\n    *   Volume of acid = 0.003719 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the 28.05 cm³ in option A.\n\nLet's re-evaluate using the volume from option A (28.05 cm³) to see if it yields the corresponding pH.\n\n*   **If Volume = 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L):**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Total Moles H⁺ - Moles for neutralization\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002805 - 0.002807 = -0.000002 mol\n    *   This result is physically impossible (negative excess H⁺), indicating that 28.05 cm³ is not even enough acid to complete the neutralization, let alone create an acidic final solution.\n\nThere appears to be a significant inconsistency in the provided options. However, if we ignore the Ksp/solubility equilibrium part of the problem and assume the question is flawed, we can analyze the options differently. The moles of H⁺ required for neutralization alone is 0.002807 mol, which would require 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid. This value is very close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). If we assume this is the intended answer, it implies that the amount of excess acid needed to lower the pH is considered negligible. In this scenario, the solution would be near neutral, which contradicts the pH of 2.04.\n\nGiven the large discrepancy and internal inconsistencies within all the options, it is highly likely the question or the options are flawed. However, based on a rigorous application of chemical principles, none of the provided choices are correct. If forced to choose the \"least wrong\" answer, one might notice the volume in option A is almost exactly what is needed for neutralization alone, but the pH is incorrect.\n\nSince a definitive answer cannot be reached from the provided options, we conclude the problem statement is erroneous. However, for the purpose of selecting an answer from the given list, there is no logical path to any of the options.\n\nLet's re-run the calculation with a different Ksp value, as this can vary between sources. A common alternative value is 4 x 10⁻³⁸.\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (4 × 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009357 = 4.275 × 10⁻³⁶\n*   [OH⁻] = 1.623 × 10⁻¹² M\n*   pOH = 11.79\n*   pH = 2.21\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻².²¹ = 0.00617 M\n*   Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.00617 M * 0.1 L = 0.000617 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000617 = 0.003424 mol\n*   Volume = 0.003424 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03424 L = 34.24 cm³\n\nThis result (pH 2.21, Vol 34.24 cm³) is still not close to any of the options. The error lies within the problem's data. Based on the calculation that the volume for neutralization alone is ~28.07 cm³, option A is the only one with a plausible volume, assuming the excess acid required is minimal. This is a weak justification, but it's the only connection that can be made.\n\nFinal check of the logic: The calculations for moles, concentrations, and stoichiometric requirements are sound. The pH calculation is directly dependent on the Ksp value, and the final volume calculation depends on the pH. The inconsistency lies between the calculated results and the options provided.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 in option A is correct and the volume is wrong.\nLet's assume the volume of 28.05 cm³ in option A is correct and the pH is wrong.\nAs shown, neither assumption validates the other part of the option. Therefore, the option is internally inconsistent.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the fact that a choice must be made, there is no chemically sound way to select one option over the others. The problem is ill-posed. However, in a multiple-choice context, if the volume for neutralization (28.07 cm³) is considered the dominant factor, option A is the closest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
