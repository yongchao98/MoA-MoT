    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4. The presence of an aromatic ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond in the ester accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Six signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic pair of doublets (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic splitting pattern for a `CH3-CH=CH-` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This fragment confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment identified above. This means there must be a second, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the molecule must contain the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   An ester group: `-COO-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `CH3-CH=CH-` (which has a formula of `C3H5` when attached to another group)\n    *   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\n3.  **Construct a Plausible Structure and Determine its Formula:**\n    Let's assemble these fragments. There are two primary ways they can be connected that are consistent with the data:\n\n    *   **Structure A:** The ester is a methyl ester, and the propenyl group is attached to the ring.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-`[ring]`-COO-CH3` (e.g., Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n    *   **Structure B:** The ester is a phenyl ester (specifically, a tolyl ester), and the rest of the molecule forms the acyl group.\n        *   `CH3-CH=CH-CO-O-`[ring]`-CH3` (e.g., 4-methylphenyl but-2-enoate or p-tolyl crotonate)\n\n    Now, let's determine the chemical formula for these structures.\n    *   **For Structure A:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    *   **For Structure B:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 3 (alkene chain) + 1 (ester C=O) + 6 (ring) + 1 (ring CH3) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (alkene chain) + 4 (ring) + 3 (ring CH3) = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (ester)\n        *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same chemical formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) = 6. This formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. To make a valid structure, a -CH2- group would need to be added, which is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n    *   **B) C11H12O2:** DBE = 6. This matches the formula derived from the structural fragments and is consistent with all the data (aromatic ring=4, C=O=1, C=C=1).\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 5. This is inconsistent. It lacks a degree of unsaturation, meaning it couldn't have the C=C vinyl group required by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 7. This is inconsistent. It has an extra degree of unsaturation (an extra ring or double bond) that is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this systematic analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided information is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
