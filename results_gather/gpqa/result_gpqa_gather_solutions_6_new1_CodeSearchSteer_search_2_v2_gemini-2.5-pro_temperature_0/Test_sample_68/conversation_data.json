This requires a multi-step calculation involving principles of special relativity and exponential decay.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is highly relativistic because its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). The Lorentz factor quantifies these relativistic effects.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This results in a longer average travel distance before decay, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$). A precise formula for this is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n    $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**: The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying follows the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$. For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires this fraction to be at least 30%.\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n    To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which represents the largest (coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the requirement.\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n*   **The \"30%\" Approximation**: The calculated value of $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m does not exactly match any of the options. This is a very common situation in multiple-choice physics problems. The key insight, identified by nearly all agents, is that a percentage like \"30%\" is often a rounded approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner answer. The most likely candidate is $1/3$, since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\n*   **Refined Calculation**: Let's re-calculate the resolution assuming the intended condition was to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Comparison with Options**: This refined result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option B: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference of less than 0.5% is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants ($E$, $m_0$, or $\\tau_0$) used when designing the problem. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This requires a multi-step calculation involving special relativity and the principles of particle decay.\n\n*   **Step 1: Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) that is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). This indicates the particle is highly relativistic, and its properties must be analyzed using the framework of special relativity. The key parameter is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Time Dilation and Decay Length:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This time dilation effect means the particle will, on average, travel a longer distance before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying follows an exponential law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Observation Condition:** For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The problem requires that this happens for at least 30% of the particles, which sets the condition: $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe consensus among all candidate answers on the calculation method is strong and correct.\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is calculated using the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light ($c$), and the Lorentz factor.\n    The precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Determine the Required Resolution ($d$):**\n    We need to find the resolution `d` that satisfies the condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. The term \"minimum resolution\" is interpreted as the coarsest (largest) possible resolution that meets this condition. We solve for the boundary:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Reconciliation with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value, $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, represents the maximum allowable resolution. Any resolution smaller than this would also work. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 2.08*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nOnly option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is in the correct physical range and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$).\n\nA crucial point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that in multiple-choice physics problems, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a result closely matching one of the options. The most logical choice here is to assume the intended condition was to observe at least 1/3 of the decays (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which is $\\ge 30\\%$).\n\nLet's re-calculate with this refined assumption:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (less than 0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants given in the problem. This confirms that D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by following the consensus approach identified in the candidate answers. This involves a multi-step calculation combining principles of special relativity and exponential decay.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor is essential for relativistic calculations and is determined by the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: Using the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime, I will calculate the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying.\n3.  **Apply the Decay Condition**: The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. As correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, this is very likely a practical approximation for the fraction 1/3 (~33.3%), which leads to a result that matches one of the options. I will use the condition that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than the resolution `d` is 1/3.\n4.  **Solve for Resolution ($d$)**: Based on the exponential decay law, $P(x > d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, I will solve for the resolution `d` using the condition from the previous step.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: Finally, I will compare the calculated resolution to the given multiple-choice options to determine the final answer.\n\nI will implement these steps in a Python script to ensure precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given physical constants and values\nE = 27.0       # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41      # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# The Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy.\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# The precise formula is lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the required resolution (d)\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays.

Understand the Goal and Physical Principles**\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, which affects the particle's lifetime and travel distance in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It accounts for time dilation. A precise formula is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Given: Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Given: Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\n    We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle. This involves a two-part calculation:\n1.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** Determine the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. This is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n2.  **Exponential Decay Statistics:** Use the mean decay length to find the specific distance, `d`, for which the probability of the particle traveling that far or farther is at least 30%. This distance `d` corresponds to the required detector resolution.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation Verification**\n\nThe core calculations are as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n    This calculation is correct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is given by $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.

The condition \"at least 30%\" is satisfied by \"at least 1/3\" ($\\approx 33.3\\%$), and using this value often leads to a precise match with one of the options. Let's use this well-justified assumption.\n\n    We solve for `d` in the boundary case: $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$.\n    Therefore, $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n\n    Using the calculated mean decay length:\n    $d = (1.8838 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx 2.0695 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n    The code output confirms this result:\n    `Required resolution (d) for 1/3 decays: 2.0695e-06 m`\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated required resolution is $d \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08*1e-1 m\n\nThe calculated value of $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is an almost perfect match for option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5% and is negligible, likely due to the rounding of the initial constants in the problem's design. All other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and the physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This involves combining principles of special relativity and exponential decay.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identify Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must account for time dilation.\n    *   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability ($P$) that a particle travels a distance greater than or equal to `d` before decaying is given by $P(d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n    *   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be greater than the detector's resolution `d`. The problem requires that this condition is met for at least 30% of the particles, so we must satisfy the inequality $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n3.  **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is lengthened due to time dilation. A precise formula is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n    $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\n    We need to find the resolution `d` that satisfies $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context refers to the coarsest (largest) resolution that still meets the condition. We solve for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Step 4: Reconcile the Result with the Given Options**\n    The calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

This discrepancy is a very common feature in physics problems. It often implies that a round percentage (like 30%) is an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner answer.\n\n    Let's test the highly plausible hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be \"at least 1/3\" (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which satisfies the condition).\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n    $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference of less than 0.5% can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem statement.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculation, combined with the standard interpretation of such physics problems, overwhelmingly points to option C as the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the final, correct choice.\n\n### **1.

If the track is shorter than the resolution, it cannot be distinguished from the point of origin.\n*   **Physical Interpretation of \"At least 30%\"**: This is a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` (the resolution) or more must be greater than or equal to 0.30.\n*   **Key Principles**: The problem involves a particle with very high energy compared to its rest mass, which requires the application of Special Relativity (specifically, time dilation) and the statistical law of exponential decay.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nAll the candidate answers correctly follow these calculation steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory before decaying. It is longer than the non-relativistic distance due to time dilation.\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   The formula is $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n*   $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n*   $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$. The condition is that this probability must be at least 30%.\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### **3. Careful Point: Reconciling the \"30%\" Condition with the Options**\n\nThis is the most critical step, which all successful candidate answers identified. If we solve for the boundary condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$, we get:\n*   $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the *maximum* allowed resolution. Any resolution smaller than this will work. While option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) satisfies this, the values are not a close match.\n\nA common feature in such physics problems is that a round percentage is an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner answer. The candidates correctly test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be \"at least 1/3\" (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which satisfies the condition).\n\nLet's re-calculate with this refined condition:\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   $d = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   $d \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n*   $d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value of **$2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** is an extremely close match to the value in option A, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and attributable to the precision of the constants given in the problem statement. All other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\nThe consensus of the provided analyses, based on sound physical principles and a standard interpretation of multiple-choice problem design, overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points and reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves a particle with a total energy (27 GeV) significantly greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). This indicates the particle is highly relativistic, and the solution must incorporate principles of Special Relativity alongside the physics of particle decay.\n    *   **Relativistic Effects:** Time dilation will cause the particle's lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame to be longer than its proper lifetime.\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability law.\n    *   **Detector Resolution:** A decay is \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the magnitude of relativistic effects. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame:** The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory before it decays. It is elongated due to relativistic effects. The precise formula is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s (Speed of light)\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s (Proper lifetime)\n    *   $\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n4.  **Apply the Observation Condition:** The problem requires observing *at least 30%* of the decays. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$. Therefore, we must find the resolution `d` that satisfies:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context refers to the coarsest (largest) resolution `d` that still meets the criterion. We solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n6.  **Reconcile with the Given Options:** The calculated value is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is the maximum permissible resolution. Let's examine the options:\n    A) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-1 m\n\n    Only option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, has the correct order of magnitude. Since $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} < 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$, it is a valid resolution. However, the numerical difference suggests a more precise interpretation is needed. As identified by all candidate answers, it is a common feature in physics problems for a percentage to be an approximation of a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to mean \"at least 1/3\" (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$).\n    *   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n    *   $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis refined calculation yields $d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (<0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants provided in the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic:** It is crucial to recognize that the particle is relativistic. A non-relativistic calculation would be incorrect by nearly an order of magnitude.\n*   **Mean Decay Length Formula:** The correct formula for the mean decay length in the lab frame must be used, accounting for both time dilation and the particle's velocity.\n*   **Interpretation of \"30%\":** The key to matching the options perfectly is to interpret \"at least 30%\" as a proxy for the simple fraction \"at least 1/3\". This is a standard convention in many physics exam questions.\n*   **Orders of Magnitude:** A quick check of the orders of magnitude of the options can often eliminate most incorrect choices immediately, leaving only the physically plausible one(s). In this case, only option B is in the correct micrometer range.\n\nBased on the unanimous and consistent analysis of all candidate answers, the correct choice is the one numerically equivalent to $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Question**\n\nThe goal is to find the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30%\" of the particle decays.\n\n*   **Observing a decay**: In a particle detector, this means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution (`d`) before it decays. If the track is shorter than `d`, it cannot be resolved.\n*   **At least 30%**: This is a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x > d` must be greater than or equal to 0.30.\n*   **Minimum resolution**: In the context of this type of physics problem, this is interpreted as the coarsest (i.e., largest value) resolution that still satisfies the observation condition.\n\n### **2. Core Physical Principles**\n\nTwo key physics concepts are required to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Special Relativity**: The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) to account for time dilation, which increases the particle's lifetime and decay length in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n2.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability `P` that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the formula:\n    $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three main steps, as agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is calculated using the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light ($c$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that we must observe at least 30% of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the threshold value, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the maximum allowed resolution. Any resolution smaller than this will also work.\n\n### **4. Comparison with Options and Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated maximum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The provided options are:\nA) 2.08*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nOption B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only choice with the correct order of magnitude. It also satisfies the condition, as $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nTo confirm that this is the intended answer, we can test a hypothesis that is common in physics problems: that the percentage \"30%\" is an approximation for a simple fraction. The fraction $1/3$ is approximately 33.3%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\nLet's re-calculate `d` with this new condition:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem. This confirms that B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent and correct methodology for solving the problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### **1. Identification of Physical Principles**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the core physics concepts required to solve the problem:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. Therefore, effects like time dilation must be considered.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability (P) that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the formula P(d) = e^(-d/λ), where λ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are \"observed.\" This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. This translates to the mathematical condition: P(d) ≥ 0.30.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe candidate answers follow a consensus calculation path:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy.\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by accounting for time dilation. The precise formula used by the agents is:\nλ = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1)\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   τ₀ is the proper lifetime (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n*   γ is the Lorentz factor (≈ 7.918)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nλ ≈ (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.918² - 1)\nλ ≈ (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ √(61.69)\nλ ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe condition is e^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which is interpreted as the threshold value (the largest possible resolution `d` that still satisfies the condition). Solving the boundary case:\ne^(-d/λ) = 0.30\nd = -λ ⋅ ln(0.30) ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **3. Analysis and Refinement**\n\nThe calculated value of d ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m does not exactly match any of the options. However, almost all candidate answers correctly identify a common feature in such physics problems: the percentage \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner result.\n\nThe most logical fraction is 1/3, since 1/3 ≈ 33.3%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition. Re-calculating with this assumption:\ne^(-d/λ) = 1/3\nd = -λ ⋅ ln(1/3) = λ ⋅ ln(3)\nd ≈ (1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986)\nd ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe refined calculation gives a required resolution of **d ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m**. This value is an extremely close match to the numerical value presented in option D.\n\n*   Calculated Value: 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m\n*   Option D: 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThe minor difference (<0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants (E, m₀, τ₀) used when designing the problem. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum detector resolution needed to observe a significant fraction of decays of a high-energy particle. This involves combining concepts from special relativity and the statistical nature of particle decay.\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to **time dilation**.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** Because of its high speed and dilated lifetime, the particle will travel, on average, a certain distance in the lab before decaying. This average distance is called the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle must be longer than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that we see at least 30% of the decays, which translates to the condition: $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2.

Use $\\gamma$ and the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n3.  Set up the probability equation $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n4.  In physics problems, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a result matching one of the options. I will test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition).\n5.  Solve for the resolution $d$ using the refined condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n6.

Synthesis of the Physical Approach**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the same underlying physics principles and follow a consistent calculation path. The key steps are:\n\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The particle is highly relativistic, so its properties in the lab frame must be calculated using special relativity.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** First, calculate the Lorentz factor, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   **Mean Decay Length (λ):** Next, calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before decaying and is elongated due to time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability of a particle traveling a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by P(x ≥ d) = e⁻ᵈ/λ.\n*   **Solving for Resolution (d):** The problem requires finding the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of decays are observed (P ≥ 0.30).\n\n### **2. Consensus on the Calculation**\n\nThere is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the numerical results of the calculation.\n\n*   **Step 1: Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n*   **Step 2: Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n    Using the formula λ = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1):\n    λ = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.918² - 1) ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n*   **Step 3: Required Resolution (d)**\n    The agents correctly deduce that in such physics problems, a percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction to yield a clean answer. They test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least 1/3 of the decays (since 1/3 ≈ 33.3%, which satisfies \"at least 30%\").\n    \n    Solving for `d` under this condition:\n    e⁻ᵈ/λ = 1/3\n    d = λ ⋅ ln(3)\n    d ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986) ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **3.

We must now compare this to the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08*1e-1 m\nC) 2.08*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nThe calculated value of 2.07 × 10⁻⁶ m is an extremely close match to the value in **option D**, 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the precision of the constants provided in the problem statement. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude and are therefore incorrect.\n\nThe confusion among the candidate answers (some choosing A, B, C, or D) arises because they appear to have been working with scrambled versions of the multiple-choice options. However, the underlying calculation is unanimously correct. Based on the options as presented in the task description, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This requires combining principles from special relativity and the statistics of particle decay.\n\n*   **\"Observing a decay\"**: For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. If the track is shorter than the resolution, it cannot be distinguished from the point of origin.\n*   **\"At least 30%\"**: This is a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution, `d`, must be at least 0.30.\n*   **\"Minimum resolution needed\"**: In the context of this problem, this refers to the threshold value—the largest (coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition. Any detector with a better (smaller) resolution would also work.\n\n### **2. Key Physical Principles and Formulas**\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is highly relativistic because its total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV). The Lorentz factor quantifies these effects.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is extended, and it travels an average distance, $\\lambda$, before decaying. A precise formula for this is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    (where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime).\n\n3.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability ($P$) that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying follows an exponential law:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nUsing the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nUsing the given proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe condition is that the probability of observing the decay must be at least 30%:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the threshold resolution, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **4. Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Initial Comparison**: The calculated maximum allowed resolution is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the options, only option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, has the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition that the resolution must be less than or equal to this value.\n\n*   **Reconciling the Discrepancy**: A crucial point, identified by all successful analyses, is that percentages in physics exam questions are often approximations for simple fractions that yield \"cleaner\" answers. The condition \"at least 30%\" is satisfied by, for example, $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$. Let's test this hypothesis, as it is a common problem-solving technique.\n\n*   **Refined Calculation**: We recalculate the resolution `d` for the condition that exactly 1/3 of the particles are observed:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**: This refined calculation gives a value of $d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is an extremely close match to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (less than 0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants given in the problem statement.

Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This requires a multi-step calculation involving special relativity and the principles of particle decay.\n\n*   **Step 1: Relativistic Effects:** The particle has a total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) that is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). This indicates the particle is highly relativistic, and its properties must be analyzed using the framework of special relativity. The key parameter is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Time Dilation and Decay Length:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This time dilation effect means the particle will, on average, travel a longer distance before decaying. This average distance is the mean decay length, $\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying follows an exponential law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Observation Condition:** For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The problem requires that this happens for at least 30% of the particles, which sets the condition: $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### **2.

The term \"minimum resolution\" is interpreted as the coarsest (largest) possible resolution that meets this condition. We solve for the boundary:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3.

Let's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to mean \"at least 1/3\" (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$).\n    *   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.0986$\n    *   $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis refined calculation yields $d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (<0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants provided in the problem.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic:** It is crucial to recognize that the particle is relativistic. A non-relativistic calculation would be incorrect by nearly an order of magnitude.\n*   **Mean Decay Length Formula:** The correct formula for the mean decay length in the lab frame must be used, accounting for both time dilation and the particle's velocity.\n*   **Interpretation of \"30%\":** The key to matching the options perfectly is to interpret \"at least 30%\" as a proxy for the simple fraction \"at least 1/3\". This is a standard convention in many physics exam questions.\n*   **Orders of Magnitude:** A quick check of the orders of magnitude of the options can often eliminate most incorrect choices immediately, leaving only the physically plausible one(s). In this case, only option B is in the correct micrometer range.\n\nBased on the unanimous and consistent analysis of all candidate answers, the correct choice is the one numerically equivalent to $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Question**\n\nThe goal is to find the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30%\" of the particle decays.\n\n*   **Observing a decay**: In a particle detector, this means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution (`d`) before it decays. If the track is shorter than `d`, it cannot be resolved.\n*   **At least 30%**: This is a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x > d` must be greater than or equal to 0.30.\n*   **Minimum resolution**: In the context of this type of physics problem, this is interpreted as the coarsest (i.e., largest value) resolution that still satisfies the observation condition.\n\n### **2. Core Physical Principles**\n\nTwo key physics concepts are required to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Special Relativity**: The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) to account for time dilation, which increases the particle's lifetime and decay length in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n2.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability `P` that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the formula:\n    $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three main steps, as agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is calculated using the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), the speed of light ($c$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot 7.854$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution ($d$)**\nThe condition is that we must observe at least 30% of the decays:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the threshold value, we solve the equality:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n$d = 1.204 \\times \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the maximum allowed resolution. Any resolution smaller than this will also work.\n\n### **4. Comparison with Options and Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated maximum resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The provided options are:\nA) 2.08*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nOption B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the only choice with the correct order of magnitude. It also satisfies the condition, as $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nTo confirm that this is the intended answer, we can test a hypothesis that is common in physics problems: that the percentage \"30%\" is an approximation for a simple fraction. The fraction $1/3$ is approximately 33.3%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\nLet's re-calculate `d` with this new condition:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$-\\frac{d}{\\lambda} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem. This confirms that B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent and correct methodology for solving the problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### **1. Identification of Physical Principles**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the core physics concepts required to solve the problem:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. Therefore, effects like time dilation must be considered.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability (P) that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the formula P(d) = e^(-d/λ), where λ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are \"observed.\" This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. This translates to the mathematical condition: P(d) ≥ 0.30.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe candidate answers follow a consensus calculation path:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy.\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by accounting for time dilation. The precise formula used by the agents is:\nλ = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1)\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   τ₀ is the proper lifetime (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n*   γ is the Lorentz factor (≈ 7.918)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nλ ≈ (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.918² - 1)\nλ ≈ (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ √(61.69)\nλ ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe condition is e^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which is interpreted as the threshold value (the largest possible resolution `d` that still satisfies the condition). Solving the boundary case:\ne^(-d/λ) = 0.30\nd = -λ ⋅ ln(0.30) ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (-1.204) ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **3. Analysis and Refinement**\n\nThe calculated value of d ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m does not exactly match any of the options. However, almost all candidate answers correctly identify a common feature in such physics problems: the percentage \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner result.\n\nThe most logical fraction is 1/3, since 1/3 ≈ 33.3%, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition. Re-calculating with this assumption:\ne^(-d/λ) = 1/3\nd = -λ ⋅ ln(1/3) = λ ⋅ ln(3)\nd ≈ (1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986)\nd ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe refined calculation gives a required resolution of **d ≈ 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m**. This value is an extremely close match to the numerical value presented in option D.\n\n*   Calculated Value: 2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m\n*   Option D: 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThe minor difference (<0.5%) is negligible and can be attributed to the rounding of the initial constants (E, m₀, τ₀) used when designing the problem. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum detector resolution needed to observe a significant fraction of decays of a high-energy particle. This involves combining concepts from special relativity and the statistical nature of particle decay.\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to **time dilation**.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** Because of its high speed and dilated lifetime, the particle will travel, on average, a certain distance in the lab before decaying. This average distance is called the mean decay length.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$.\n*   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the track left by the particle must be longer than the detector's resolution, $d$. The problem requires that we see at least 30% of the decays, which translates to the condition: $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$.\n\n### 2.

Use $\\gamma$ and the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n3.  Set up the probability equation $e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n4.  In physics problems, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a result matching one of the options. I will test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays (since $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition).\n5.  Solve for the resolution $d$ using the refined condition $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n6.

Synthesis of the Physical Approach**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the same underlying physics principles and follow a consistent calculation path. The key steps are:\n\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The particle is highly relativistic, so its properties in the lab frame must be calculated using special relativity.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** First, calculate the Lorentz factor, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   **Mean Decay Length (λ):** Next, calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle, $X^0$. This requires combining principles from special relativity and the statistics of particle decay.\n\n*   **\"Observing a decay\"**: For a decay to be observed, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution before it decays. If the track is shorter than the resolution, it cannot be distinguished from the point of origin.\n*   **\"At least 30%\"**: This is a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution, `d`, must be at least 0.30.\n*   **\"Minimum resolution needed\"**: In the context of this problem, this refers to the threshold value—the largest (coarsest) resolution that still satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition. Any detector with a better (smaller) resolution would also work.\n\n### **2. Key Physical Principles and Formulas**\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is highly relativistic because its total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV). The Lorentz factor quantifies these effects.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is extended, and it travels an average distance, $\\lambda$, before decaying.

Looking at the options, only option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, has the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition that the resolution must be less than or equal to this value.\n\n*   **Reconciling the Discrepancy**: A crucial point, identified by all successful analyses, is that percentages in physics exam questions are often approximations for simple fractions that yield \"cleaner\" answers. The condition \"at least 30%\" is satisfied by, for example, $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$. Let's test this hypothesis, as it is a common problem-solving technique.\n\n*   **Refined Calculation**: We recalculate the resolution `d` for the condition that exactly 1/3 of the particles are observed:\n    $e^{-d/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    $-d/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**: This refined calculation gives a value of $d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is an extremely close match to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The negligible difference (less than 0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants given in the problem statement. This provides strong evidence that A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle, X⁰. This requires a multi-step calculation involving special relativity and the principles of particle decay.\n\n*   **\"Observing a decay\"**: This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`d`) before it decays.\n*   **\"At least 30%\"**: This sets a probability condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x ≥ d` must be at least 0.30.\n*   **Physical Principles**:\n    1.  **Special Relativity**: The particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must account for time dilation.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability that a particle will travel a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the formula P(x ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ), where λ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe consensus among all correct analyses is to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n\n*   γ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is lengthened by relativistic effects. A precise formula is:\n\nλ = c ⋅ τ₀ ⋅ √(γ² - 1)\n\n*   Using c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s, τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s, and γ ≈ 7.918:\n*   λ ≈ (3 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ⋅ √(7.918² - 1)\n*   λ ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ √(62.69 - 1)\n*   λ ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) ⋅ (7.854)\n*   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Required Resolution (d)**\nThe condition is that the probability of observing the decay must be at least 30%:\n\nP(x ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30\n\nSolving for the boundary condition `e^(-d/λ) = 0.30` gives the maximum allowable (i.e., coarsest) resolution:\n\n*   -d/λ = ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204\n*   d = 1.204 ⋅ λ ≈ 1.204 ⋅ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis means the resolution `d` must be less than or equal to 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m.\n\n### **3. Analysis and Comparison with Options**\n\nThe calculated maximum allowed resolution is `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. Let's examine the given options:\n*   A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n*   B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n*   D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nOnly option A, `2.08 * 1e-6 m`, is in the correct order of magnitude and satisfies the condition `d ≤ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n\n### **4. Careful Point: Reconciling the Numerical Value**\n\nA crucial point, identified by nearly all the candidate answers, is that in multiple-choice physics problems, a percentage like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a result matching one of the options perfectly.\n\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that the intended condition was to observe at least **1/3** of the decays (since 1/3 ≈ 33.3%, which is ≥ 30%).\n*   The condition becomes: e^(-d/λ) = 1/3\n*   Solving for `d`: -d/λ = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n*   d = λ ⋅ ln(3) ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) ⋅ (1.0986)\n*   **d ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m**\n\nThis refined calculation gives a result of `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, which is an almost perfect match for option A, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The negligible difference (<0.5%) is attributable to the precision of the constants given in the problem. This confirms that A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
