  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments**\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural pieces of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Crucially, the data states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This is a key constraint. To have an ester and a methyl group without a methylene (-CH₂) bridge, the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall formula:\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is the number of rings and pi bonds. This is an excellent way to cross-check our result.\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and D. We are left with A (C12H14O2) and C (C11H12O2).\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\n\nOur detailed fragment analysis derived the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. The other remaining option, A (C12H14O2), differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out option A. Therefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the reasoning from the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe first step is to break down the provided information into the constituent parts of the molecule. This process was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and Ester:** The ¹H NMR shows two signals for -CH₃ groups. One is in the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Absence of –CH₂ Groups:** This is a critical constraint. To form an ester that includes the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) group (which would be present in, for example, an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assembling the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion was unanimously reached by all candidate answers based on their chemical reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA final check is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (the number of rings and π-bonds) to ensure consistency.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n    *   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   **B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Does not match)\n    *   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Does not match)\n    *   **D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Matches DoU, but this formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are no –CH₂ groups, ruling this option out).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This is the only option that has the correct degree of unsaturation and is consistent with all the NMR signals, especially the absence of any –CH₂ groups. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first independently determine the correct molecular formula by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR). I will break down the data into molecular fragments, sum their atomic compositions, and verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation. Then, I will write a Python script to automate this calculation and compare the derived formula against the specific options given in the original question to determine the correct choice. This approach ensures accuracy by relying on fundamental chemical principles and avoids the confusion seen in the candidate answers, where the letter-to-formula mapping was inconsistent.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic hydrogens. The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **Vinyl Group Analysis**: The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the two -CH₃ signals. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n\n3.  **Ester and Second Methyl Group Analysis**: The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The 1H NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal and, crucially, **no -CH₂ signals**. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula**: By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring (1 ring, 3 double bonds) = 4 DoU\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   **Total DoU = 6**\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas** (using DoU = C + 1 - H/2):\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and D. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option C. We can definitively rule out option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) because it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, making C₁₂H₁₄O₂ an incorrect choice despite having the correct DoU.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Crucially, the data confirms there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl chain or similar structure attached to the ester (e.g., -COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these components gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:** We use the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches DoU, but see Step 4)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options A and D. We are left with B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). Our detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 led directly to C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) differs from this by one CH₂ unit. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Consensus Chemical Reasoning\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, follow an identical and sound chemical reasoning process. They all correctly deduce the molecular formula from the spectroscopic data. The consensus conclusion from the chemical analysis is that the formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Summarize the Deduction of the Molecular Formula\nThe correct formula is derived by breaking down the spectroscopic information into molecular fragments and summing their atoms.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n2.  **Vinyl Group Fragment:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n3.  **Ester and Methyl Fragment:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The ¹H NMR shows a second methyl signal but, crucially, **no -CH₂- signals**. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n4.  **Assembly:** Summing the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (from the ester) = **2**\n    *   This unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThis provides a powerful check on the result.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** Aromatic ring (4) + C=C double bond (1) + C=O double bond (1) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming the formula. This method also helps eliminate other options. For example, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ also has a DoU of 6, but it contains an extra CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nThe chemical analysis from all candidate answers is unanimous and correct: the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates are due to them referencing different lists of options.\n\nBased on the options provided in the original question prompt:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) **C11H12O2**\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correctly derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first and most critical step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule. This analysis was performed correctly and consistently across all 15 candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" points to a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group & No -CH₂- Groups:** The spectrum shows a second methyl (-CH₃) signal but, crucially, **no methylene (-CH₂-) signals**. For an ester to contain a methyl group without a methylene group, it must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula. This calculation was also performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA final check confirms the validity of the derived formula. The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula with the options provided in the original question.\n\n**Question Options:**\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **D**. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong atom count, an incorrect degree of unsaturation, or would require the presence of a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to variations in the option lists they were working with, not errors in their chemical analysis. The chemical reasoning is unanimous and points to a single correct formula.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided information shows a unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning, even though the final letter choices vary due to differences in the option lists presented to each agent. The correct approach is to independently verify the chemical formula and then map it to the specific options provided in the question.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" This indicates a symmetrical, para-substituted benzene ring, which is a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-), and the NMR shows a second methyl signal. The crucial constraint is the **absence of any –CH₂ signals**. This rules out structures like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to have an ester and a methyl group without a methylene bridge is to have either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the total formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    A check of the DoU confirms this result.\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Now we match this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2**\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H14O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe derived formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** matches option A. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong degree of unsaturation (B, C) or contain a -CH₂- group (D), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe most reliable method to solve this problem is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a molecular fragment and then assemble them.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" combined with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution. This fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group**: The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group**: The ¹H NMR signals described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂\" Constraint**: The ¹H NMR shows two distinct signals for -CH₃ groups and, critically, **no signals for -CH₂ groups**. One methyl group is in the propenyl fragment. The second must be part of the ester. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is a key constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula:\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion is unanimously supported by the chemical reasoning in all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is the number of rings and π-bonds. This serves as an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural features**:\n    *   Aromatic ring: 4 (1 ring + 3 π-bonds)\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond: 1\n    *   Ester C=O double bond: 1\n    *   **Total DoU = 6**\n\n*   **DoU from the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**:\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options and Final Decision\n\nThe derived and verified formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now match this to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5, incorrect)\n*   B) **C11H12O2** (DoU = 6, correct)\n*   C) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6, but contains an extra CH₂ group, which is explicitly absent)\n*   D) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7, incorrect)\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means it is a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents, leaving four hydrogens on the ring. The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Methyl Groups and Ester Structure:** The ¹H NMR shows two distinct signals for –CH₃ groups. One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. A critical piece of information is that there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This constraint eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**).

(Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Careful Points\n\nThe DoU calculation narrows the possibilities to B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). The final decision rests on the most specific piece of data provided: **\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n\n*   The formula derived from our detailed fragment analysis is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n*   The other possibility, **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, differs from our derived formula by exactly one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The presence of this extra CH₂ group is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ must be incorrect. The only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B in the original question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and contains one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons, one C=C double bond, and one of the two methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and the \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** The spectrum shows two signals for -CH₃ groups. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality. The critical constraint is that there are **no signals for -CH₂- groups**. This rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### 2. Assembly of Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the overall molecular formula:\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these components gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides a crucial check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural features:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:** We calculate the DoU for each option using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and C. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nOur detailed fragment analysis derived the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, which corresponds to option D. Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the same degree of unsaturation but differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out option A.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\n\nThe core of this problem is to translate the provided spectroscopic data into the structural components of the unknown molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A benzene ring with two substituents has the base formula C₆H₄. The presence of only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This gives us the first fragment: **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ signals and no –CH₂ signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester. The critical constraint is the absence of any methylene (–CH₂) signals. This rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This serves as an excellent verification step.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Correct)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Incorrect, see Step 4)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Elimination of Other Options\n\nThe detailed fragment analysis and the DoU calculation both point to **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** as the correct formula. This corresponds to option B.\n\nWe can definitively rule out the other options:\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ have incorrect Degrees of Unsaturation.\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the correct Degree of Unsaturation (6), but its formula differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which makes this option impossible.\n\nTherefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the original question, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct chemical formula, highlighting all the careful points required for an accurate conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe most reliable method is to translate each piece of spectroscopic information into a molecular fragment and then assemble them. All the provided answers correctly follow this logic.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The information \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. For the four protons on the ring to give only two signals, a para (1,4) substitution is the most likely arrangement. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and the \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows two distinct signals for –CH₃ groups and, critically, **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. One methyl group is in the propenyl fragment. The second must be part of the ester. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a key constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion is unanimously supported by the chemical reasoning in all the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is the number of rings and π-bonds, serving as an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural features**:\n    *   Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 π-bonds) = 4 DoU\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   **Total DoU = 6**\n\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas** (using the formula DoU = C + 1 - H/2):\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Potentially correct, but see Step 4)\n    *   C) **C11H12O2**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Correct)\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Elimination of Alternatives\n\nThe detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 and the DoU check in Step 3 both point to **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** as the correct formula. This corresponds to option C.\n\nWe must carefully consider option B, C12H14O2, which also has the correct DoU of 6. However, this formula contains one more carbon and two more hydrogens (a CH₂ group) than the formula derived from the spectroscopic fragments. The problem explicitly states, **\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups,\"** which definitively rules out C12H14O2.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This process was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern.

This conclusion was unanimously reached by all candidate answers based on their chemical reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA final check is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (the number of rings and π-bonds) to ensure consistency.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n    *   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.

(Does not match)\n    *   **D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Matches DoU, but this formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived structure. The problem explicitly states there are no –CH₂ groups, ruling this option out).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This is the only option that has the correct degree of unsaturation and is consistent with all the NMR signals, especially the absence of any –CH₂ groups. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first independently determine the correct molecular formula by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR). I will break down the data into molecular fragments, sum their atomic compositions, and verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation. Then, I will write a Python script to automate this calculation and compare the derived formula against the specific options given in the original question to determine the correct choice. This approach ensures accuracy by relying on fundamental chemical principles and avoids the confusion seen in the candidate answers, where the letter-to-formula mapping was inconsistent.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Analysis**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic hydrogens. The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n\n2.  **Vinyl Group Analysis**: The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the two -CH₃ signals. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n\n3.  **Ester and Second Methyl Group Analysis**: The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms**. The 1H NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal and, crucially, **no -CH₂ signals**. To have an ester with a methyl group but no methylene (-CH₂) group, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula**: By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from C₃H₅ propenyl) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂ ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The derived molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

Assembly of Fragments and Calculation of the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This conclusion is unanimously reached by all candidate answers based on sound chemical reasoning.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA crucial check is to ensure the degree of unsaturation (number of rings + π bonds) is consistent.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the derived formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the correct formula.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe detailed analysis of all spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C12H14O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C12H12O2\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option A. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong degree of unsaturation (C, D) or contain a -CH₂- group (B), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula can be determined. The reasoning across all candidate answers is chemically sound and consistent, even if the final letter choices vary due to different option ordering. The consensus on the chemical formula itself is unanimous.\n\nHere is a careful, step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Fragments from Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The information describes a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Having only two signals for these four protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the two methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). The ¹H NMR shows a second methyl signal. A crucial piece of information is that there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This rules out common ester formations like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to incorporate the ester and the second methyl group without a -CH₂- group is to have either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the total atom count:\n    *   Aromatic Ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Propenyl Group: C₃H₅\n    *   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a check for the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n    *   **From the structure:** The structure contains an aromatic ring (4 DoU), one vinyl C=C double bond (1 DoU), and one ester C=O double bond (1 DoU). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2)`. For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, this is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the derived formula is correct.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (Incorrect atom count, DoU = 7)\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (Matches our derived formula and DoU)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Incorrect atom count; contains an extra CH₂ group, which is ruled out by the NMR data)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (Incorrect atom count, DoU = 5)\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first and most critical step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural components of the unknown molecule.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which, for the four protons on a di-substituted ring, strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons, one of the methyl groups, and a C=C double bond. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Second Methyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups.\" One has been assigned to the propenyl group. The second must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Absence of –CH₂ Groups:** The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This is a crucial constraint. For an ester to contain the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) bridge (as in an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), the fragment must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring (1 ring, 3 double bonds) = 4 DoU\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   **Total DoU = 6**\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas** (using DoU = C + 1 - H/2):\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and D. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and C (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\n\nThe detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 unambiguously led to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option C. We can definitively rule out option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) because it contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula. The problem explicitly states there are **no –CH₂ groups**, making C₁₂H₁₄O₂ an incorrect choice despite having the correct DoU.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** The ¹H NMR shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Crucially, the data confirms there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This means the second methyl group cannot be part of an ethyl chain or similar structure attached to the ester (e.g., -COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these components gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides an excellent cross-check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:** We use the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = **6**. (Matches DoU, but see Step 4)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options A and D. We are left with B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). Our detailed fragment analysis in Step 2 led directly to C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Option C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) differs from this by one CH₂ unit. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Consensus Chemical Reasoning\nAll fifteen candidate answers, despite some variations in their final letter choice, follow an identical and sound chemical reasoning process. They all correctly deduce the molecular formula from the spectroscopic data. The consensus conclusion from the chemical analysis is that the formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Summarize the Deduction of the Molecular Formula\nThe correct formula is derived by breaking down the spectroscopic information into molecular fragments and summing their atoms.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring Fragment:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" indicates a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n2.  **Vinyl Group Fragment:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n3.  **Ester and Methyl Fragment:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The ¹H NMR shows a second methyl signal but, crucially, **no -CH₂- signals**. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n4.  **Assembly:** Summing the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (from the ester) = **2**\n    *   This unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\nThis provides a powerful check on the result.\n*   **DoU from Structure:** Aromatic ring (4) + C=C double bond (1) + C=O double bond (1) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\nThe DoU values match perfectly, confirming the formula. This method also helps eliminate other options. For example, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ also has a DoU of 6, but it contains an extra CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nThe chemical analysis from all candidate answers is unanimous and correct: the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates are due to them referencing different lists of options.\n\nBased on the options provided in the original question prompt:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) **C11H12O2**\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correctly derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first and most critical step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the constituent parts of the molecule. This analysis was performed correctly and consistently across all 15 candidate answers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The description \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" points to a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. This fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (**-COO-**), which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR signals of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group & No -CH₂- Groups:** The spectrum shows a second methyl (-CH₃) signal but, crucially, **no methylene (-CH₂-) signals**. For an ester to contain a methyl group without a methylene group, it must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula. This calculation was also performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nA final check confirms the validity of the derived formula. The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** Using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, we get `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n\nThe DoU values match, confirming that **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** is the correct formula.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Final Answer\n\nThe final step is to match the derived formula with the options provided in the original question.\n\n**Question Options:**\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nOur derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, corresponds to option **D**. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong atom count, an incorrect degree of unsaturation, or would require the presence of a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to variations in the option lists they were working with, not errors in their chemical analysis. The chemical reasoning is unanimous and points to a single correct formula.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nAn analysis of the provided information shows a unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning, even though the final letter choices vary due to differences in the option lists presented to each agent. The correct approach is to independently verify the chemical formula and then map it to the specific options provided in the question.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" This indicates a symmetrical, para-substituted benzene ring, which is a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-), and the NMR shows a second methyl signal. The crucial constraint is the **absence of any –CH₂ signals**. This rules out structures like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The only way to have an ester and a methyl group without a methylene bridge is to have either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the total formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    A check of the DoU confirms this result.\n    *   **From the structure:** 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   **From the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DoU values match, confirming the formula is correct.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula and one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group**: The ¹H NMR signals described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" for two vinyl protons is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two methyl groups.\n*   **Second Methyl Group and \"No -CH₂\" Constraint**: The ¹H NMR shows two distinct signals for -CH₃ groups and, critically, **no signals for -CH₂ groups**. One methyl group is in the propenyl fragment. The second must be part of the ester. The \"no -CH₂\" rule is a key constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃).

The ¹H NMR shows only \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.

One belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester. A critical piece of information is that there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This constraint eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming either a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH₃**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This is an excellent way to cross-check the result.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DoU\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DoU\n    *   **Total DoU = 6**\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas (using DoU = C + 1 - H/2):**\n    *   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. (Matches DoU, but see Step 4)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Careful Points\n\nThe DoU calculation narrows the possibilities to B (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). The final decision rests on the most specific piece of data provided: **\"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n\n*   The formula derived from our detailed fragment analysis is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n*   The other possibility, **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, differs from our derived formula by exactly one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group). The presence of this extra CH₂ group is explicitly contradicted by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ must be incorrect. The only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B in the original question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments\n\nThe first step is to translate the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra into the structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4). This core fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula and contains one C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\" This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons, one C=C double bond, and one of the two methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **Methyl Groups and the \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** The spectrum shows two signals for -CH₃ groups. One is part of the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester functionality. The critical constraint is that there are **no signals for -CH₂- groups**. This rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### 2. Assembly of Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can find the overall molecular formula:\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these components gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This provides a crucial check.\n\n*   **DoU from the structural features:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:** We calculate the DoU for each option using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6\n\nThe DoU calculation eliminates options B and C. We are left with A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nOur detailed fragment analysis derived the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, which corresponds to option D. Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the same degree of unsaturation but differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which definitively rules out option A.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Molecular Fragments\n\nThe core of this problem is to translate the provided spectroscopic data into the structural components of the unknown molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A benzene ring with two substituents has the base formula C₆H₄. The presence of only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly indicates a symmetrical, para (1,4) substitution pattern. This gives us the first fragment: **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the final formula.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR shows two –CH₃ signals and no –CH₂ signals:** One methyl signal is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl signal must belong to the ester. The critical constraint is the absence of any methylene (–CH₂) signals. This rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). In either case, this fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** to the overall formula.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from the identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   Aromatic Ring Fragment: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl Group Fragment: C₃H₅\n*   Ester + Methyl Fragment: C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming these gives:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. This serves as an excellent verification step.\n\n*   **DoU from the structure:** 4 (for the aromatic ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n*   **DoU from the candidate formulas:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6** (Correct)\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6 (Incorrect, see Step 4)\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision and Elimination of Other Options\n\nThe detailed fragment analysis and the DoU calculation both point to **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** as the correct formula. This corresponds to option B.\n\nWe can definitively rule out the other options:\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ have incorrect Degrees of Unsaturation.\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has the correct Degree of Unsaturation (6), but its formula differs from our derived formula by one CH₂ group. The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**, which makes this option impossible.\n\nTherefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is the only formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
