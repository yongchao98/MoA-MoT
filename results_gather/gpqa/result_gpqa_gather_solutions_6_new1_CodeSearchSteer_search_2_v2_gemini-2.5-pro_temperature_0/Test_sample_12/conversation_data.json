The stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂, Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and leads to the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (pointing \"down\").\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to be on wedges.\n    4.

The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, is inverted to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    4.  The configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.\n    5.

The key to solving this problem is to correctly track the stereochemistry through each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic isopropenyl group). It has one stereocenter at C4 with an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, leaving the endocyclic double bond untouched. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group, which directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (\"down\").\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    4.  A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    4.  The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry of the final product is the same as its alcohol precursor.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed through the most favorable reaction pathway is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering (the isopropyl group is at C4).\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   D) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer. The key to this problem is correctly tracking the stereochemistry through each reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation.** Determine which of the two double bonds in (R)-(+)-Limonene is reduced by one equivalent of H₂/Pd/C.\n2.  **Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation.** Determine the stereochemistry of the major epoxide formed when product 1 reacts with m-CPBA. This depends on the directing effect of the existing stereocenter.\n3.  **Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening.** Determine where the methoxide nucleophile attacks the epoxide and with what stereochemical outcome (inversion or retention).\n4.  **Step 4: Esterification.** Determine if the final step affects the stereochemistry.\n5.  **Conclusion.** Compare the final derived structure with the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n    *   (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain (isopropenyl group).\n    *   Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) is selective and reduces the less substituted, more accessible double bond first.\n    *   Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is reduced, converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1 is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with m-CPBA, which forms an epoxide across the C1-C2 double bond.\n    *   This is a diastereoselective reaction. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which is (R), conventionally drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders the top face of the ring.\n    *   The m-CPBA will attack from the less hindered, opposite face (*anti*-attack). This means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) of this major isomer gives: **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n    *   **Product 2 (major isomer) is (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. The attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. The methoxide attacks C2 from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was (R), inverts to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n    *   **Product 3 (major isomer) is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Esterification**\n    *   Product 3 is converted to an ester using propanoic acid and DCC/DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n    *   This reaction occurs at the oxygen of the hydroxyl group and does not affect any of the stereocenters. The configuration is retained.\n    *   **Product 4 (major isomer) is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic (side-chain) double bond is disubstituted, while the endocyclic (in-ring) double bond is trisubstituted. Therefore, the hydrogenation will selectively reduce the exocyclic double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\"). The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the dashed face (\"down\"). This creates an epoxide where the oxygen atom is on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereospecificity):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**, and the configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Product 4:** The stereochemistry of the final product is the same as its alcohol precursor.

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is both less substituted (disubstituted vs. trisubstituted) and more accessible. Therefore, the reaction selectively reduces the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The major product isolated is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** This is an epoxidation reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This diastereoselective reaction leads to the formation of the major isomer of Product 2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** In the most stable conformation, the (R)-isopropyl group is equatorial. Assuming it points \"up\" (on a wedge), the m-CPBA will attack from the \"down\" face (on a dash). This places the epoxide oxygen *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters at C1 and C2 reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, epoxide ring-opening occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on the dashed face, the nucleophile attacks from the wedged face. The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the tertiary hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The Steglich esterification is a mild method that proceeds with retention of configuration at all chiral centers, as no bonds to the stereocenters are broken.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe major isomer formed in this reaction sequence is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.

Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond is reduced selectively, while the endocyclic (trisubstituted) double bond remains.\n*   **Product 1**: The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent**: 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity)**: This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group, which sterically hinders one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This pathway forms the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2**: For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge. The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the dashed face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash. Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) shows the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent**: Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity)**: Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereospecificity)**: The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3**: The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are unaffected by the reaction. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents**: Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry)**: This reaction converts the tertiary alcohol at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of all stereocenters is **retained**.\n*   **Product 4**: The final major product is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4. The major product formed via the most favorable reaction pathway is the most valid answer. Our analysis shows this major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the result if the Sₙ2 attack occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.

Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the major epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**.

This would be the product if the Sₙ2 attack occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect.\n*   C) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the structure of the major product derived from the analysis.**\n*   D) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the structure corresponding to the major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the correct structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is both less substituted (disubstituted vs. trisubstituted) and more accessible. Therefore, it is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxidation of the remaining double bond at C1-C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and leads to the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  In the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (pointing into the page).\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash. This forces the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C2 to be on wedges.\n    4.  Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters: C1 becomes **(S)** and C2 becomes **(R)**.\n    5.  Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack on the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Thus, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, is inverted to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    4.  The configuration at C4 is unaffected, remaining **(R)**.\n    5.  The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at all stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4. The major product formed through the most favorable reaction pathway is a valid component of the final product mixture. Our analysis shows the major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result from an incorrect Sₙ2 mechanism (retention of configuration).\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\nC) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\nD) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product. The key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the outcome of each reaction, paying close attention to selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Reaction:** (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic isopropenyl group).\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond at C1-C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is typically represented on a wedge. The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the dashed face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions (Sₙ2 mechanism), the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**, and C4 remains **(R)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).

The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group, which sterically hinders one face of the ring.

Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.

The key to solving this problem is to correctly track the stereochemistry through each reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Steps**\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic isopropenyl group). It has one stereocenter at C4 with an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, leaving the endocyclic double bond untouched. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group, which directs the incoming m-CPBA to the opposite face of the ring to minimize steric hindrance. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\").\n    2.  The *anti*-attack means the m-CPBA approaches from the dashed face (\"down\").\n    3.  The resulting epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    4.  A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    4.  The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The stereochemistry of the final product is the same as its alcohol precursor.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe major product formed through the most favorable reaction pathway is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   B) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering (the isopropyl group is at C4).\n*   C) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   D) **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate** - This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

This depends on the directing effect of the existing stereocenter.\n3.  **Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Opening.** Determine where the methoxide nucleophile attacks the epoxide and with what stereochemical outcome (inversion or retention).\n4.  **Step 4: Esterification.** Determine if the final step affects the stereochemistry.\n5.  **Conclusion.** Compare the final derived structure with the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n    *   (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain (isopropenyl group).\n    *   Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) is selective and reduces the less substituted, more accessible double bond first.\n    *   Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is reduced, converting the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 1 is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n    *   Product 1 is treated with m-CPBA, which forms an epoxide across the C1-C2 double bond.\n    *   This is a diastereoselective reaction. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 (which is (R), conventionally drawn on a wedge) sterically hinders the top face of the ring.\n    *   The m-CPBA will attack from the less hindered, opposite face (*anti*-attack). This means the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.\n    *   Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the new stereocenters (C1 and C2) of this major isomer gives: **(1S, 2R, 4R)**.\n    *   **Product 2 (major isomer) is (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile. Under basic conditions, this is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (CH₃O⁻) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, while C2 is secondary. The attack occurs at **C2**.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. The methoxide attacks C2 from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge.\n    *   The configuration at C2, which was (R), inverts to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 remains (S).\n    *   **Product 3 (major isomer) is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Esterification**\n    *   Product 3 is converted to an ester using propanoic acid and DCC/DMAP (Steglich esterification).\n    *   This reaction occurs at the oxygen of the hydroxyl group and does not affect any of the stereocenters. The configuration is retained.\n    *   **Product 4 (major isomer) is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic (side-chain) double bond is disubstituted, while the endocyclic (in-ring) double bond is trisubstituted. Therefore, the hydrogenation will selectively reduce the exocyclic double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\"). The m-CPBA will therefore attack from the dashed face (\"down\"). This creates an epoxide where the oxygen atom is on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**, and the configuration at C4 is unchanged as **(R)**.

It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic). The stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Analysis (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. The exocyclic double bond is both less substituted (disubstituted vs. trisubstituted) and more accessible. Therefore, the reaction selectively reduces the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected. The major product isolated is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Analysis (Stereoselectivity):** This is an epoxidation reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4, bearing a bulky isopropyl group, directs the approach of the m-CPBA. To minimize steric hindrance, the reagent will attack from the face of the ring *opposite* to the isopropyl group (*anti*-attack). This diastereoselective reaction leads to the formation of the major isomer of Product 2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** In the most stable conformation, the (R)-isopropyl group is equatorial. Assuming it points \"up\" (on a wedge), the m-CPBA will attack from the \"down\" face (on a dash). This places the epoxide oxygen *trans* to the isopropyl group. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters at C1 and C2 reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Ring-Opening of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Analysis (Regio- and Stereoselectivity):** Under basic conditions, epoxide ring-opening occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide attacks **C2**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The methoxide attacks C2 from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on the dashed face, the nucleophile attacks from the wedged face. The configuration at C2 inverts from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Steglich Esterification of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction converts the tertiary hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The Steglich esterification is a mild method that proceeds with retention of configuration at all chiral centers, as no bonds to the stereocenters are broken.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe major isomer formed in this reaction sequence is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.

The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group, which sterically hinders one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This pathway forms the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2**: For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is on a wedge. The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the dashed face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash. Assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) shows the major epoxide isomer is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereospecific Epoxide Opening**\n*   **Reactant**: Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent**: Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a source of the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity)**: Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening is an Sₙ2 reaction.

The major product formed via the most favorable reaction pathway is the most valid answer. Our analysis shows this major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would be the result if the Sₙ2 attack occurred with retention of configuration, which is mechanistically incorrect.\n*   B) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\n*   C) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering; the isopropyl group is at C4.\n*   D) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product. The key to solving this problem is to correctly track the stereochemistry through each transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one inside the ring and a disubstituted one in the side chain.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic (disubstituted) double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic (trisubstituted) double bond remains. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a crucial step. The existing stereocenter at C4 has a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and leads to the major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For the (R) configuration, the isopropyl group is conventionally drawn on a wedge (pointing out of the page). The *anti*-attack therefore occurs from the dashed face (pointing into the page). This places the new epoxide oxygen on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer.\n*   **Product 2 (Major Isomer):** The major product is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic ring-opening follows an Sₙ2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the attack occurs at **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks from the wedge side.\n*   **Product 3 (Major Isomer):** The configuration at C2, which was (R) in the major epoxide, is inverted to **(S)**. The configurations at C1 (S) and C4 (R) are retained. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group into an ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the stereochemistry of all chiral centers is retained.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major isomer formed in this reaction sequence is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.

Therefore, the major isomer of Product 2 is **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Regio- and Stereoselective Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic/nucleophilic conditions, the reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack on the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Thus, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3 (Major Isomer):**\n    1.  The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n    2.  The configuration at C2, which was **(R)**, is inverted to **(S)**.\n    3.  The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**.\n    4.  The configuration at C4 is unaffected, remaining **(R)**.\n    5.  The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbons. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at all stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Major Isomer):** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a valid structure of product 4. The major product formed through the most favorable reaction pathway is a valid component of the final product mixture. Our analysis shows the major product is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would result from an incorrect Sₙ2 mechanism (retention of configuration).\nB) (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect numbering and substitution pattern.\nC) 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate - Incorrect constitutional isomer.\nD) (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - **This perfectly matches the derived structure of the major product.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product. The key to solving this problem is to correctly predict the outcome of each reaction, paying close attention to selectivity and stereochemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n*   **Reaction:** (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with one equivalent of H₂ over a Pd/C catalyst.\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the ring (endocyclic) and a disubstituted one in the side chain (exocyclic isopropenyl group).\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation with a heterogeneous catalyst like Pd/C is faster for the less substituted and less sterically hindered double bond. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond is selectively reduced.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is converted to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an epoxide across the remaining double bond at C1-C2.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** This is a diastereoselective reaction. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group. To minimize steric hindrance, the m-CPBA reagent will attack the double bond from the face *opposite* to this bulky group. This is known as *anti*-attack and forms the major diastereomer.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2:** For the (R)-isomer, the isopropyl group is typically represented on a wedge. The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the dashed face, placing the new epoxide oxygen on a dash. A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions (Sₙ2 mechanism), the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is a tertiary carbon, while C2 is a secondary carbon. Therefore, the methoxide ion attacks **C2**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereospecificity):** The Sₙ2 reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** The methoxide attacks C2 of the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide. The configuration at C2, which was (R), is inverted to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**, and C4 remains **(R)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemistry):** This reaction converts the hydroxyl group at C1 into a propionate ester. The reaction occurs at the oxygen atom and does not affect any of the chiral centers. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product retains the stereochemistry of Product 3. Its structure is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.

Its stereocenter at C4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) with only one equivalent of H₂.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for less substituted and less sterically hindered double bonds. Therefore, the exocyclic double bond of the isopropenyl group is selectively reduced to an isopropyl group, while the endocyclic double bond remains. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected.\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemical step. The existing stereocenter at C4 bears a bulky isopropyl group, which sterically hinders one face of the ring. The m-CPBA reagent will preferentially attack the double bond from the opposite, less hindered face (*anti*-attack). This leads to the formation of one major diastereomer of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 2 (Major Isomer):** For the (R) isomer, the isopropyl group is typically drawn on a wedge (pointing \"up\"). The *anti*-attack by m-CPBA occurs from the dashed face (\"down\"). A careful assignment of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the newly formed stereocenters (C1 and C2) reveals the major epoxide isomer to be **(1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe), which provides the strong nucleophile methoxide (CH₃O⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Regioselectivity):** Under basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.

The key to solving this problem is to correctly determine the stereochemistry at each stage of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (R)-(+)-Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted double bond within the six-membered ring and a disubstituted double bond in the isopropenyl side chain. The stereocenter at carbon 4 has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂ over Pd/C) with only one equivalent of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** Catalytic hydrogenation is faster for double bonds that are less sterically hindered and less substituted. The exocyclic (side-chain) double bond is disubstituted, while the endocyclic (in-ring) double bond is trisubstituted. Therefore, the hydrogen will selectively add across the exocyclic double bond.\n*   **Product 1:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group. The stereocenter at C4 is not affected. The product is **(R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: Diastereoselective Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagent:** 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), which forms an epoxide across the remaining double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Diastereoselectivity):** This is a critical stereochemical step.

The nucleophile attacks from the face opposite the C-O bond.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Product 3:** Since the epoxide oxygen is on a dash, the methoxide attacks C2 from the wedge side. This inverts the configuration at C2 from (R) to **(S)**. The configuration at C1 is retained as **(S)**, and C4 remains **(R)**. The resulting alcohol is **(1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, the (1S, 2S, 4R)-alcohol.\n*   **Reagents:** Propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).
