The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, the major product is the para-substituted isomer. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. To determine the extent of oxidation (to an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid), we must consider the next reaction step. The third step involves acetone and base, which is characteristic of a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde as the electrophile.

The methyl group is an ortho-, para-director. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is the para-substituted one, which is p-nitrotoluene.\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1.** p-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. Considering the next reaction step (with acetone and base), the most logical product is the aldehyde, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which is required for a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n3.  **Step 3: Condensation of Product 2.** p-nitrobenzaldehyde reacts with acetone in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide. This is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The enolate of acetone attacks the aldehyde, and the resulting product dehydrates to form the stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n4.  **Step 4: Symmetry Analysis of Product 3.** The final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is a planar molecule due to its extensive conjugated system. We will analyze its symmetry elements:\n    *   It has an identity element (E).\n    *   It has a single plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   It does not have any proper rotation axes (Cₙ, n>1) because the two ends of the molecule are different.\n    *   It does not have a center of inversion (i).\n5.  **Conclusion:** A molecule with only E and a single σ plane belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n6.  **Final Answer:** Match the Cs point group to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the final product of a three-step reaction\n    and identifies its molecular symmetry group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine Product 1\n    product_1 = \"p-nitrotoluene\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> {product_1}\")\n    print(\"This is an electrophilic nitration.

To determine the product, we must consider the next step in the synthesis. The third step is a reaction with acetone and base, which is a classic Claisen-Schmidt condensation.

The methyl group is an ortho-, para-director. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is the para-substituted one, which is p-nitrotoluene.\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1.** p-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.

To determine the product, we must consider the subsequent reaction. Step 3 involves acetone and base, which is the classic setup for a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.

The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting intermediate readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.

The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is known as \"mixed acid\" and generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. It activates the ring towards electrophilic substitution.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para-substituted product is the major product.

To determine the extent of oxidation (to an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid), it is crucial to consider the next step in the synthesis.\n*   **Contextual Clue:** The next step involves acetone and a base. This is the classic setup for a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, a type of aldol reaction that requires an aldehyde as one of the reactants. This strongly implies that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is the thermodynamically more stable trans (E) isomer due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.

To maximize orbital overlap and stability, the main framework of the molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no axis of rotation.
