All candidate answers correctly identify and follow these core steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition**: The problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of particle decays. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the neutral particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying. This is expressed using the exponential decay survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame. Solving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Relativistic Momentum ($pc$)**: Since the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is time-dilated and is most accurately calculated using the momentum:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    Using the given values ($\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**: Now, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1:\n    $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\nAnalyzing the candidate answers and the problem reveals several crucial points that are necessary for arriving at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: It is essential to correctly interpret \"observing a decay\" as the particle traveling a distance *greater* than the resolution, and to model this with the $e^{-x/\\lambda}$ survival function.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation**: Non-relativistic calculations would be completely wrong. The use of the energy-momentum relation to find `pc` is the most accurate approach for this relativistic particle.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: The calculated value based on a literal \"30%\" is ~$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is close, but not identical, to the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (a ~9% difference). As almost all the candidate answers correctly deduce, it is a common practice in multiple-choice physics questions for a rounded percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe result from the \"1/3 hypothesis\" ($2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an excellent match for the option value of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This provides overwhelmingly strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the question.

All provided candidate answers correctly identify the same general method, but a careful analysis reveals key subtleties, particularly in the interpretation of the question's parameters.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays.\n- A decay is considered **observed** if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution (`d_{res}$) before decaying into its charged products.\n- The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability `P` that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is given by:\n  $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n- To find the *minimum* resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n  $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n- By taking the natural logarithm and rearranging, we solve for `d_res`:\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length `λ` in the laboratory frame. The most accurate way involves using the particle's lab-frame momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (`λ`)**: The mean decay length is given by the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime and `c` is the speed of light.\n    $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$ \\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution and Analyze Results\n\nNow, we substitute the value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nSince $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Comparing this result with the options:**\nThe calculated resolution is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The given options are:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n\nOur result is clearly closest to option A, as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$). The other options are off by factors of thousands or more.\n\n### Careful Point: Interpreting \"30%\"\n\nThere is a ~9% discrepancy between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). A vast majority of the candidate answers astutely identify a common feature of physics multiple-choice questions: round numbers are often used as approximations for simpler fractions to make the options neater.\nLet's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to mean a survival probability of **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the condition becomes:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$$\nSolving for `d_res`:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$$\nRecalculating with this condition:\n$$d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$$\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for the value in option A, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for reaching the given answer. Both the direct calculation and the refined interpretation point conclusively to the same option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. This requires combining concepts from special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle. Since the $X^0$ particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point.\n\n*   This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $$P(travel\\_distance \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: The most precise method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating lab-frame decay length to proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$ \\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Results and Options**\n\n*   Our calculated resolution is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n*   The provided options are:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n*   A direct comparison shows that our calculated result is numerically closest to option **D**, as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$).\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: It is crucial to identify that this is a statistical problem governed by the exponential decay law, not a deterministic one.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation**: Using the momentum `pc` from the energy-momentum relation is the most robust way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential pitfalls of calculating the Lorentz factor `γ` and velocity `v` separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a key insight identified by nearly all successful candidate answers. The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed with a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) instead of exactly 30%.\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, **$2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that D is the intended answer. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct order of magnitude) and the more refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively identify D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Physical Interpretation of \"Observing\"**\nAn \"observed\" decay implies that the neutral particle, $X^0$, which does not leave a track, must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as separate from the point where its charged decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, appear. This means the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$, before it decays.\n\nThis condition is governed by the exponential decay law, which describes the probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$:\n$$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nTo find the minimum resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find the mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($\\lambda$).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Accurate Calculation of Mean Decay Length (`λ`)**\nThe most precise way to find the lab-frame decay length is by using the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$). This avoids separate calculations of velocity and the Lorentz factor.\n1.  **Calculate momentum ($pc$)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula relating lab-frame decay length to momentum and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.

Let's compare this result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **A**.

As correctly identified by nearly all candidate answers, a common feature of multiple-choice physics problems is that round percentages like \"30%\" are often approximations for simpler fractions. Let's test the highly likely hypothesis that the problem was designed with a survival probability of **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$, which gives:\n$$d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$$\nUsing our calculated $\\lambda \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n$$d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for the value in option A, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%.

Both the direct calculation (pointing to the correct order of magnitude) and the more refined calculation (providing an almost exact match) point conclusively to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physical Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) that a detector must possess to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the high-energy particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Definition of \"Observe a Decay\":** The initial particle $X^0$ is neutral and therefore does not leave a track in the bubble chamber. Its decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, are charged and do leave tracks. An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, i.e., Travel Distance > $d_{res}$.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. This is a statistical process. We need to find the minimum resolution that satisfies this condition.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Key Physical Principles\nTo solve this, we must combine two key areas of physics:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV). This means it is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light, and we must use relativistic equations to describe its motion and decay.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is described by the equation: $P(L \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution**\nTo find the minimum resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we use the boundary condition from the exponential decay law:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we can solve for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame ($\\lambda$) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The most accurate way to calculate this uses the particle's lab-frame momentum.\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean travel distance in the particle's rest frame.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for `λ`.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Analysis of the Result and Careful Points\n\n**Analysis**: Our calculated value is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options from the problem statement:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated result has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) only for option D. All other options are off by factors of 1,000 or more, making them physically incorrect.\n\n**Careful Point: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\"**\nThere is a ~9% difference between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This is a strong clue. As noted by nearly all candidate answers, it is a common practice in physics exam questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\n*   If $P(L > d_{res}) = 1/3$, then the condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended method to reach the given answer. Both lines of reasoning—the direct calculation pointing to the correct order of magnitude, and the refined calculation providing an almost exact match—conclusively identify option D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a synthesis of the candidate answers and identifying the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core task is to determine the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. For this to happen, the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution (`x > d_{res}`) before it decays.\n*   **Physics Principles:** The solution requires combining two key areas of physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** Since the particle's total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to calculate its lifetime and travel distance in the lab frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the necessary calculation steps, which are summarized here.\n\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution.**\nTo find the *minimum* resolution to observe *at least* 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame.**\nThe most precise way to find $\\lambda$ uses the particle's momentum ($p$), which is calculated from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719$ GeV²\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for $\\lambda$.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### **3. Analysis, Careful Points, and Final Decision**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.**\nOur calculated value is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options given in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are incorrect by many orders of magnitude. This alone makes D the only plausible answer.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.**\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As correctly identified by a majority of the candidate answers, a common practice in physics exam questions is to use a round percentage like \"30%\" as an approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n*   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This strongly confirms that D is the intended answer.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Inconsistent Option Labeling.**\nIt is important to note that the candidate answers show significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the correct numerical value. However, the numerical result itself is consistent across all competent analyses. By referring strictly to the option list provided in the main question prompt, the correct choice is unambiguously identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe physics and calculation steps are consistent across all credible analyses. Both a direct calculation and a more refined interpretation (using 1/3 instead of 30%) point conclusively to the numerical value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step reasoning process that leads to the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Physical Question:** The goal is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as a separate event from the decay point. Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the resolution `d_res` before it decays.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `d` or greater is:\n    $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** Since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to find its mean decay length in the lab frame. The most accurate method uses the particle's momentum ($p$).\n    *   **Calculate Momentum-Energy ($pc$)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n    *   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$. Using the speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s, and the proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s:\n        $$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Resolution (d_res):** Now, we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step 2.\n    *   Using the literal \"30%\" value: $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$.\n        $$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Direct Comparison:** Our direct calculation yields a result of **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Looking at the provided options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **A**. Our calculated value is numerically close to this option, differing by about 9%.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\":** As noted by almost all the provided agents, a ~9% discrepancy in a multiple-choice physics problem often points to an approximation in the problem statement.

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem and Core Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. This requires combining two core principles of physics:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic equations to describe its motion and decay.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process.

Analysis of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\nAn \"observed\" decay implies that the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Understanding \"Observation\":** Since the particle $X^0$ is neutral, it leaves no track in the bubble chamber. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish the creation vertex from the decay vertex (where the charged products $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). This means the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The decay of particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n*   **The Mathematical Formulation:** To find the *minimum* resolution needed to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n### **2. Calculation Steps**\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first find the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, $\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\n    The particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated by relativistic effects. It is most accurately calculated using the formula: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n    Now we solve the equation from the first section: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Result and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Comparing Calculation to Options**\n    The calculated value is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options given in the question:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **B**. Our calculated value is numerically close to this option, differing by about 9%.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**\n    As correctly identified by almost all the provided answers, such a discrepancy is often a clue in physics test problems. The stated percentage \"30%\" is likely a convenient approximation for a simpler fraction used to design the problem. The most likely candidate is **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This refined result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match for the value in option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5%, providing strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Inconsistent Option Labeling in Candidate Answers**\n    While the provided candidate answers showed confusion over which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponded to the correct numerical value, they were unanimous in their calculation that the answer is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Based on the option list provided in the original question, this value corresponds to option B.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe physics and calculations consistently point to a value of approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The refined analysis using the \"1/3 hypothesis\" provides an almost perfect match. This confirms that B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Understanding \"Observation\":** Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$). This allows the creation vertex and the decay vertex to be distinguished as two separate points.\n\n*   **Applying the Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by the survival function:\n    $P(distance > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Here, $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame of reference.\n\n*   **Setting the Boundary Condition:** To find the *minimum* resolution that observes \"at least 30%\" of decays, we solve for the boundary case where the probability is exactly 30% (or 0.30):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    By taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get the equation for the resolution:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nBecause the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find its mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most accurate method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects. The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$)\n\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Result and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: Comparing Calculation with Options.** The calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a resolution of **$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options from the prompt:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **C**. Our calculated value is numerically close to this option, differing by about 9%. The other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more, making them incorrect.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 2: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\".** The 9% discrepancy is a hint. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as convenient approximations for simpler, more fundamental fractions. The most likely candidate here is **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis, as nearly all the provided answers correctly did.\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Recalculating with our value for $\\lambda$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\nThis refined calculation gives a result that is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the problem's answer choices.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined hypothesis-based calculation point conclusively to the numerical value presented in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires combining principles of special relativity with the statistical law of particle decay. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis based on the reasoning presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physics Principles**\n\nThe core task is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Observation Condition\"**. Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it does not leave a track in the bubble chamber. It can only be \"observed\" indirectly when its charged decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, create tracks. A decay is considered resolved or \"observed\" only if the neutral $X^0$ particle travels a distance from its creation point that is *greater* than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$). If it travels a shorter distance, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n\n*   **The Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability `P` that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: The requirement to observe \"at least 30%\" of decays means we must find the resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $d_{res}$, we get:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, not the particle's rest frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**. The most accurate way to find the relativistic parameters is through momentum, using the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**. The formula relating the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) to the lab-frame decay length ($\\lambda$) via momentum is:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    Using the speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Calculating the Resolution and Comparing with Options**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation for $d_{res}$.\n\n*   **Calculation (Literal Interpretation)**:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nNow we compare this result with the provided options:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is only consistent with the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) of option **B**. All other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**. There is a small (~9%) discrepancy between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). As many of the candidate answers astutely identified, this is a common feature in physics test questions where a round number like \"30%\" is an approximation for a simpler fraction, most likely **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **Calculation (Refined Interpretation)**:\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    Solving gives $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **B**, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the question.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined interpretation point conclusively to the same option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the common reasoning and careful points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution of a detector required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle, $X^0$.\n\n*   **The Goal**: Find the minimum resolution, which we will call $d_{res}$.\n*   **The Observation Condition**: To \"observe\" a decay, the neutral particle must travel a distance `x` that is greater than the detector's resolution ($x > d_{res}$) before decaying. This allows the creation point and decay point to be distinguished as two separate events.\n*   **The Physics Principles**: This problem combines two key areas of modern physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity**: Because the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to describe its motion and lifetime in the lab frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random, probabilistic process. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance of at least `x` is described by the survival function $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Formulate the Mathematical Condition**\nTo observe at least 30% of decays, we need the probability $P(x > d_{res})$ to be $\\ge 0.30$. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nTo use the above formula, we first need to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is calculated using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, which accurately combines momentum and the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step A.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3.

Let's look at the options provided in the question:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-9 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **A**. All other options are incorrect by a factor of 1000 or more, making A the only physically plausible choice.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\".**\n    As correctly identified by a majority of the candidate answers, there is a small discrepancy ($\\approx 9\\%$) between our calculated value and the value in option A.

This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's answer options.

The candidate answers are highly consistent in their physical reasoning and calculation, allowing for a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. The Physical Condition for Observation**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding what \"observing a decay\" means for a neutral particle. A neutral particle ($X^0$) leaves no track in a bubble chamber. Its decay is only \"observed\" if its charged decay products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear at a location that is distinguishably separate from the particle's creation point. This means the neutral particle must travel a distance, $d$, greater than the detector's spatial resolution, $d_{res}$, before it decays.\n\nThis requirement can be formulated using the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ (in the lab frame) will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by:\n$$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nThe problem states that we must observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**2. Relativistic Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic because its total energy in the lab frame ($E=27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV). Therefore, its lifetime is dilated, and its travel distance in the lab is much longer than it would be otherwise. We must calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$ in the lab frame.\n\n*   **First, calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$).** This is done using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean decay distance in the particle's own rest frame.\n    Given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step 1.\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**4. Final Comparison and Refinement**\n\nThe calculated resolution based on the literal wording of the problem is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n\nOur calculated value is numerically closest to option **A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. It is the only option with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correctly interpreting \"observe\":** The key is translating the word \"observe\" into the mathematical condition that the travel distance must be greater than the detector resolution ($d > d_{res}$).\n2.  **Using momentum for decay length:** It is most accurate to use the formula relating the mean decay length to momentum ($\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$) rather than calculating the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and velocity separately, as this avoids potential rounding errors.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis:** This is the most critical insight, identified by all thorough candidate answers. The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option A value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, round numbers like \"30%\" are often approximations for simpler fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the problem intended a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) yields:\n    *   Condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   Resolution: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   Calculation: $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n    This result is an extremely close match (less than 0.5% difference) to option A.

Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** An \"observed\" decay requires that the neutral particle ($X^0$) travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish it from the decay point where the charged products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear. This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n\n*   **Physics Principles:** The solution relies on two key areas of physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. Relativistic equations are necessary to describe its motion and decay in the laboratory frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process. The probability that a particle will travel a distance of at least `d` before decaying is given by the survival function: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Formulation and Calculation Steps**\n\nThe agents consistently followed these steps:\n\n**Step A: Set up the Mathematical Condition for Resolution.**\nTo observe \"at least 30%\" of decays, we must find the minimum resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition:\n$$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ yields:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ) in the Lab Frame.**\nThis requires using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most accurate method uses the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (λ):** The formula relating the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) to the lab-frame mean decay length ($\\lambda$) via momentum is:\n    *   $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nSubstitute the calculated value of `λ` into the equation from Step A.\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Analysis, Careful Points, and Final Decision**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.**\nThe calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a resolution of approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Comparing this with the options provided:\n*   A) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n*   B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n*   C) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n*   D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nOnly option **D** has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$).

All candidate answers correctly identify and follow these core steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Physical Condition**: The problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of particle decays. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the neutral particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying. This is expressed using the exponential decay survival function:\n    $P(\\text{distance} > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame. Solving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Relativistic Momentum ($pc$)**: Since the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic.

All provided candidate answers correctly identify the same general method, but a careful analysis reveals key subtleties, particularly in the interpretation of the question's parameters.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays.\n- A decay is considered **observed** if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance `d` that is greater than the detector's resolution (`d_{res}$) before decaying into its charged products.\n- The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability `P` that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance of at least `d_res` is given by:\n  $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n- To find the *minimum* resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n  $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n- By taking the natural logarithm and rearranging, we solve for `d_res`:\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length `λ` in the laboratory frame. The most accurate way involves using the particle's lab-frame momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (`λ`)**: The mean decay length is given by the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime and `c` is the speed of light.\n    $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$ \\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution and Analyze Results\n\nNow, we substitute the value of `λ` back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nSince $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Comparing this result with the options:**\nThe calculated resolution is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.

The other options are off by factors of thousands or more.\n\n### Careful Point: Interpreting \"30%\"\n\nThere is a ~9% discrepancy between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). A vast majority of the candidate answers astutely identify a common feature of physics multiple-choice questions: round numbers are often used as approximations for simpler fractions to make the options neater.\nLet's test the hypothesis that \"at least 30%\" was intended to mean a survival probability of **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the condition becomes:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$$\nSolving for `d_res`:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$$\nRecalculating with this condition:\n$$d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$$\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for the value in option A, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%.

This requires combining concepts from special relativity with the statistical laws of particle decay.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition for \"Observation\"**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding what it means to \"observe\" the decay of a neutral particle. Since the $X^0$ particle leaves no track, its decay is observed only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve as distinct from the decay point.\n\n*   This means the particle's travel distance, `d`, must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `d` or greater is given by:\n    $$P(travel\\_distance \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n*   Solving for `d_res` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must calculate its mean decay length in the laboratory frame using relativistic kinematics.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: The most precise method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula relating lab-frame decay length to proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and momentum is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$ \\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Results and Options**\n\n*   Our calculated resolution is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n*   The provided options are:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n*   A direct comparison shows that our calculated result is numerically closest to option **D**, as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$).\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Correct Physics Model**: It is crucial to identify that this is a statistical problem governed by the exponential decay law, not a deterministic one.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation**: Using the momentum `pc` from the energy-momentum relation is the most robust way to account for relativistic effects, avoiding potential pitfalls of calculating the Lorentz factor `γ` and velocity `v` separately.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**: This is a key insight identified by nearly all successful candidate answers. The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed with a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) instead of exactly 30%.\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: This refined result, **$2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that D is the intended answer. Both the direct calculation (which points to the correct order of magnitude) and the more refined calculation (which gives a near-perfect numerical match) conclusively identify D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all crucial points.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruction of the Physical Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Physical Interpretation of \"Observing\"**\nAn \"observed\" decay implies that the neutral particle, $X^0$, which does not leave a track, must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as separate from the point where its charged decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, appear. This means the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$, before it decays.\n\nThis condition is governed by the exponential decay law, which describes the probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$:\n$$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nTo find the minimum resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find the mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($\\lambda$).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Accurate Calculation of Mean Decay Length (`λ`)**\nThe most precise way to find the lab-frame decay length is by using the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$). This avoids separate calculations of velocity and the Lorentz factor.\n1.  **Calculate momentum ($pc$)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula relating lab-frame decay length to momentum and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.

An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, i.e., Travel Distance > $d_{res}$.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. This is a statistical process. We need to find the minimum resolution that satisfies this condition.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Key Physical Principles\nTo solve this, we must combine two key areas of physics:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV). This means it is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light, and we must use relativistic equations to describe its motion and decay.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is described by the equation: $P(L \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution**\nTo find the minimum resolution for observing at least 30% of decays, we use the boundary condition from the exponential decay law:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we can solve for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame ($\\lambda$) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The most accurate way to calculate this uses the particle's lab-frame momentum.\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean travel distance in the particle's rest frame.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for `λ`.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Analysis of the Result and Careful Points\n\n**Analysis**: Our calculated value is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options from the problem statement:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated result has the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m) only for option D. All other options are off by factors of 1,000 or more, making them physically incorrect.\n\n**Careful Point: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\"**\nThere is a ~9% difference between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This is a strong clue. As noted by nearly all candidate answers, it is a common practice in physics exam questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\n*   If $P(L > d_{res}) = 1/3$, then the condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended method to reach the given answer. Both lines of reasoning—the direct calculation pointing to the correct order of magnitude, and the refined calculation providing an almost exact match—conclusively identify option D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a synthesis of the candidate answers and identifying the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core task is to determine the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. For this to happen, the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution (`x > d_{res}`) before it decays.\n*   **Physics Principles:** The solution requires combining two key areas of physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** Since the particle's total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to calculate its lifetime and travel distance in the lab frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the necessary calculation steps, which are summarized here.\n\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution.**\nTo find the *minimum* resolution to observe *at least* 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame.**\nThe most precise way to find $\\lambda$ uses the particle's momentum ($p$), which is calculated from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719$ GeV²\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for $\\lambda$.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### **3. Analysis, Careful Points, and Final Decision**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.**\nOur calculated value is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options given in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are incorrect by many orders of magnitude. This alone makes D the only plausible answer.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.**\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As correctly identified by a majority of the candidate answers, a common practice in physics exam questions is to use a round percentage like \"30%\" as an approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n*   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This strongly confirms that D is the intended answer.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Inconsistent Option Labeling.**\nIt is important to note that the candidate answers show significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the correct numerical value. However, the numerical result itself is consistent across all competent analyses. By referring strictly to the option list provided in the main question prompt, the correct choice is unambiguously identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe physics and calculation steps are consistent across all credible analyses. Both a direct calculation and a more refined interpretation (using 1/3 instead of 30%) point conclusively to the numerical value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step reasoning process that leads to the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Physical Question:** The goal is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved as a separate event from the decay point. Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `d` greater than the resolution `d_res` before it decays.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Condition:** The decay of particles is a random process governed by the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` (in the laboratory frame) will travel a distance `d` or greater is:\n    $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n    The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n    $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** Since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic.

The most likely candidate here is **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nLet's test this well-founded hypothesis:\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option B, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 1%. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended path to the solution and confirms that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Inconsistency in Candidate Answers' Option Labeling**\nWhile the candidate answers unanimously derive the same numerical result (~$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), they provide different final letter answers (A, B, C, or D). This is due to the list of options being presented to them in different orders. However, based on the options listed in the question prompt for this task, the value **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** corresponds to option B.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the direct calculation pointing to the correct order of magnitude, and the refined calculation providing an almost exact match—conclusively identify the value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m as correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the most critical points.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Understanding \"Observation\":** Since the particle $X^0$ is neutral, it leaves no track in the bubble chamber. Its decay is considered \"observed\" only if it travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to distinguish the creation vertex from the decay vertex (where the charged products $Y^+$ and $Z^-$ appear). This means the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The decay of particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n*   **The Mathematical Formulation:** To find the *minimum* resolution needed to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n### **2. Calculation Steps**\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first find the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, $\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\n    The particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated by relativistic effects. It is most accurately calculated using the formula: $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n    Now we solve the equation from the first section: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Result and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Comparing Calculation to Options**\n    The calculated value is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options given in the question:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **B**. Our calculated value is numerically close to this option, differing by about 9%.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**\n    As correctly identified by almost all the provided answers, such a discrepancy is often a clue in physics test problems. The stated percentage \"30%\" is likely a convenient approximation for a simpler fraction used to design the problem. The most likely candidate is **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    This refined result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match for the value in option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5%, providing strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Inconsistent Option Labeling in Candidate Answers**\n    While the provided candidate answers showed confusion over which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponded to the correct numerical value, they were unanimous in their calculation that the answer is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Based on the option list provided in the original question, this value corresponds to option B.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe physics and calculations consistently point to a value of approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The refined analysis using the \"1/3 hypothesis\" provides an almost perfect match. This confirms that B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Physical Condition\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Understanding \"Observation\":** Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it leaves no track. A decay is considered \"observed\" only if the particle travels a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$). This allows the creation vertex and the decay vertex to be distinguished as two separate points.\n\n*   **Applying the Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by the survival function:\n    $P(distance > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Here, $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame of reference.\n\n*   **Setting the Boundary Condition:** To find the *minimum* resolution that observes \"at least 30%\" of decays, we solve for the boundary case where the probability is exactly 30% (or 0.30):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    By taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get the equation for the resolution:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nBecause the particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find its mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$):** The most accurate method is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects. The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.853) \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$)\n\nNow we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Result and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: Comparing Calculation with Options.** The calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a resolution of **$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options from the prompt:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **C**. Our calculated value is numerically close to this option, differing by about 9%. The other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more, making them incorrect.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 2: The \"1/3 Hypothesis\".** The 9% discrepancy is a hint. In multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as convenient approximations for simpler, more fundamental fractions. The most likely candidate here is **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis, as nearly all the provided answers correctly did.\n    *   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   Recalculating with our value for $\\lambda$:\n        $d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\nThis refined calculation gives a result that is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended method for designing the problem's answer choices.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined hypothesis-based calculation point conclusively to the numerical value presented in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires combining principles of special relativity with the statistical law of particle decay. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis based on the reasoning presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Physics Principles**\n\nThe core task is to find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Observation Condition\"**. Since the $X^0$ particle is neutral, it does not leave a track in the bubble chamber. It can only be \"observed\" indirectly when its charged decay products, $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, create tracks. A decay is considered resolved or \"observed\" only if the neutral $X^0$ particle travels a distance from its creation point that is *greater* than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$). If it travels a shorter distance, the creation and decay points are indistinguishable.\n\n*   **The Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability `P` that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: The requirement to observe \"at least 30%\" of decays means we must find the resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $d_{res}$, we get:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle's energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is highly relativistic. We must calculate the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, not the particle's rest frame.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**. The most accurate way to find the relativistic parameters is through momentum, using the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**. The formula relating the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) to the lab-frame decay length ($\\lambda$) via momentum is:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    Using the speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Calculating the Resolution and Comparing with Options**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation for $d_{res}$.\n\n*   **Calculation (Literal Interpretation)**:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nNow we compare this result with the provided options:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is only consistent with the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) of option **B**. All other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis**. There is a small (~9%) discrepancy between our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). As many of the candidate answers astutely identified, this is a common feature in physics test questions where a round number like \"30%\" is an approximation for a simpler fraction, most likely **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **Calculation (Refined Interpretation)**:\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    Solving gives $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (\\ln(3)) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **B**, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for the question.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined interpretation point conclusively to the same option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the common reasoning and careful points from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution of a detector required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle, $X^0$.\n\n*   **The Goal**: Find the minimum resolution, which we will call $d_{res}$.\n*   **The Observation Condition**: To \"observe\" a decay, the neutral particle must travel a distance `x` that is greater than the detector's resolution ($x > d_{res}$) before decaying. This allows the creation point and decay point to be distinguished as two separate events.\n*   **The Physics Principles**: This problem combines two key areas of modern physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity**: Because the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to describe its motion and lifetime in the lab frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles is a random, probabilistic process. The probability that a particle will survive to travel a distance of at least `x` is described by the survival function $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Formulate the Mathematical Condition**\nTo observe at least 30% of decays, we need the probability $P(x > d_{res})$ to be $\\ge 0.30$. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nTo use the above formula, we first need to calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the laboratory frame.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The mean decay length in the lab frame is calculated using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, which accurately combines momentum and the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step A.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3.

Let's look at the options provided in the question:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-9 m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **A**.

This provides extremely strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's answer options. Both the direct calculation (which gets us to the right order of magnitude) and the refined calculation (which gets an almost exact match) point conclusively to the same answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step application of principles from special relativity and particle decay statistics to determine a detector's minimum resolution. The candidate answers are highly consistent in their physical reasoning and calculation, allowing for a definitive conclusion.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. The Physical Condition for Observation**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding what \"observing a decay\" means for a neutral particle. A neutral particle ($X^0$) leaves no track in a bubble chamber. Its decay is only \"observed\" if its charged decay products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear at a location that is distinguishably separate from the particle's creation point. This means the neutral particle must travel a distance, $d$, greater than the detector's spatial resolution, $d_{res}$, before it decays.\n\nThis requirement can be formulated using the exponential decay law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ (in the lab frame) will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by:\n$$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nThe problem states that we must observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ gives:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**2. Relativistic Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic because its total energy in the lab frame ($E=27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV). Therefore, its lifetime is dilated, and its travel distance in the lab is much longer than it would be otherwise. We must calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$ in the lab frame.\n\n*   **First, calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$).** This is done using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).** The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean decay distance in the particle's own rest frame.\n    Given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and the speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated value of $\\lambda$ back into our equation from Step 1.\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**4. Final Comparison and Refinement**\n\nThe calculated resolution based on the literal wording of the problem is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n\nOur calculated value is numerically closest to option **A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. It is the only option with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correctly interpreting \"observe\":** The key is translating the word \"observe\" into the mathematical condition that the travel distance must be greater than the detector resolution ($d > d_{res}$).\n2.  **Using momentum for decay length:** It is most accurate to use the formula relating the mean decay length to momentum ($\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$) rather than calculating the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and velocity separately, as this avoids potential rounding errors.\n3.  **The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis:** This is the most critical insight, identified by all thorough candidate answers. The calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the option A value ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. In multiple-choice physics problems, round numbers like \"30%\" are often approximations for simpler fractions. Testing the hypothesis that the problem intended a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) yields:\n    *   Condition: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n    *   Resolution: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n    *   Calculation: $d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n    This result is an extremely close match (less than 0.5% difference) to option A. This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's answer choices.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the refined hypothesis conclusively point to the value presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
