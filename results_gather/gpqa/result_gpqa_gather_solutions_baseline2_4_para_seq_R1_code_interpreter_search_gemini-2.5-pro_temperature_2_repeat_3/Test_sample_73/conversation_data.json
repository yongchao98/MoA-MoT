The core reasoning and numerical result, however, are consistent and correct.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle: The Memoryless Property**\n    Radioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this distribution is that it is **\"memoryless.\"** This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age,\" and it does not become more or less likely to decay as time goes on.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**\n    Because the process is memoryless, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant to its future behavior. This condition is a distractor. The problem simplifies to the much more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a duration `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom decays within a duration `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes. This is a more useful parameter for the next step.\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, which we have simplified to `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can find `S(150)` by using the value of `S(100)` and the properties of exponents. Notice that 150 minutes is 1.5 times 100 minutes.\n    `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value `S(100) = 0.68`:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value**\n    Let's calculate the result:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n\n    This is the probability of survival for 150 minutes. The probability of decay is:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n7.  **Compare to Options and Final Decision**\n    The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to **43.926%**. We compare this to the provided options:\n    A) 48%\n    B) 44%\n    C) 52%\n    D) 40%\n\n    The calculated value of `43.926%` is closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **The \"Memoryless\" Trap**: The most common mistake is to think the 50 minutes of past survival changes the future probability. It does not. This information must be disregarded.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay**: The calculation is most easily done using the survival probability (`S(t)`), but the final answer required is the decay probability (`P(t) = 1 - S(t)`). It's important not to confuse the two and mistakenly report the survival probability (~56%) as the answer.\n*   **Exponent Rules**: Correctly using the relationship `S(k*t) = (S(t))^k` is the mathematical shortcut that avoids needing to solve for the decay constant `λ` explicitly.\n*   **Approximation**: The exact answer is not an integer percentage. The final step requires selecting the *closest* option from the list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is unanimous agreement on the underlying physics principle and the mathematical methodology. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to variations in the option lists provided to each agent, but the numerical result is consistent across all solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The central concept to solving this problem is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This is a fundamental characteristic of the exponential distribution that models decay. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is entirely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age,\" and its chance of decaying does not increase over time.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Because the process is memoryless, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous and should be disregarded. The problem simplifies to the much more direct question: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**: The probability of radioactive decay is described by the following formulas:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a duration `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a duration `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the essential parameter we need.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    Using the properties of exponents, we can relate the survival probability for 150 minutes to the one for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value we found in Step 4:\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The final probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    *   Then, calculate the decay probability: `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n7.  **Compare to Options and Conclude**: The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to **43.93%**.

Recognizing that the past 50 minutes are irrelevant is the first and most critical step.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay Probability**: It is important not to confuse the two. The calculation is most cleanly done by finding the survival probability first (`S(t) = 0.68`) and then using that to find the target decay probability (`P(150) = 1 - S(150)`). It's easy to calculate `S(150) ≈ 0.56` and forget the final `1 - S(150)` step.\n*   **Exponent Rules**: The mathematical shortcut `S(150) = (S(100))^1.5` is valid and much simpler than explicitly solving for the decay constant `λ`, which can introduce unnecessary rounding errors.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the thorough analysis of all candidate answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the methodology and the numerical result. The final answer is determined by following this consolidated reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem describes radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This is the most crucial concept to understand. It means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The 50 minutes the atom has already survived has no bearing on its future behavior; the atom does not \"age\" or become \"due\" for decay.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Because the process is memoryless, we can disregard the information about the first 50 minutes. The problem is equivalent to asking the simpler question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**: The probability of decay `P(t)` within a time `t` is given by the formula `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. Conversely, the probability of survival `S(t)` is `e^(-λt)`. Therefore, `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - S(100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can easily find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value, `S(100)`, is the key parameter needed for the next step. It allows us to solve the problem without having to explicitly calculate `λ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`. We can find `S(150)` by using the properties of exponents and our known value for `S(100)`.\n    *   `S(150) = S(100 * 1.5) = (S(100))^1.5`\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Now we can calculate `P(150)`:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value**: We calculate the value of the expression:\n    *   First, `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    *   Then, `P(150) = 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n    This probability, `0.43926`, is equivalent to **43.926%**.\n\n7.  **Compare to Options**: The calculated value of `43.926%` must be compared to the given options:\n    *   A) 44%\n    *   B) 48%\n    *   C) 52%\n    *   D) 40%\nThe calculated value is closest to **44%**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key**: The most common mistake is to incorrectly factor in the 50 minutes that have already passed. This information is irrelevant and must be ignored.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay Probability**: It is crucial to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The given information is `P(100)`, but the most direct calculation path uses the intermediate value `S(100)`. The final answer must be the decay probability `P(150)`.\n*   **Correct Use of Exponents**: The relationship `S(a*t) = (S(t))^a` is the mathematical shortcut that allows the problem to be solved efficiently without finding the decay constant `λ`.\n*   **Rounding to the Nearest Option**: The calculated answer is not exactly one of the options, so the correct choice is the one it is closest to. `43.926%` is unambiguously closest to `44%`.\n\nThe unanimous consensus of the candidate agents on the reasoning and calculation confirms this result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll candidate agents unanimously agree on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve this problem. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to variations in the ordering of the multiple-choice options they received, but the numerical result is consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle - The \"Memoryless\" Property**\n\nThe most critical concept is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**.

This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future interval is entirely independent of its past history. An atom does not \"age\" or become \"overdue\" for decay.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous. It's a common trick in such problems. The question is not one of conditional probability based on the first 50 minutes; it simplifies significantly. We can rephrase the question as: \"What is the probability a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**\n    Radioactive decay is modeled by the exponential decay formula. It's often easier to work with the *survival* probability `S(t)` before finding the decay probability `P(t)`.\n    *   Survival probability: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   Decay probability: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - S(100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    `S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   **Careful Point**: Using `S(100) = 0.68` as a key parameter is more direct and avoids potential rounding errors from first calculating the decay constant `λ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`. We can find `S(150)` by relating it to our known value `S(100)` using the properties of exponents.\n    `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `S(150) = (S(100))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   **Careful Point**: The relationship is exponential, not linear. You cannot, for example, assume the rate for 50 minutes is half the rate for 100 minutes.

This means that the probability of an event (in this case, an atomic decay) occurring in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. An atom does not \"age\" or become \"overdue\" for decay. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information for calculating its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**\n    Because the process is memoryless, we can simplify the question.

This information is used to find a key parameter for the calculation.\n*   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes, a crucial step taken by all agents:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `S(100) = 0.68`, allows us to solve the problem without needing to find the decay constant `λ` itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability\nThe goal is to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which due to the memoryless property, is simply `P(150)`.\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nAll agents correctly used the properties of exponents to relate `S(150)` to the known value of `S(100)`:\n*   `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nBy substituting the value from Step 3, we get the expression for the survival probability over 150 minutes:\n*   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Numerical Value\nThe final probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nPerforming the calculation gives:\n*   `S(150) ≈ 0.56074`\n*   `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\nWhen expressed as a percentage, this is **43.926%**.\n\n### Step 6: Match with Options and State Careful Points\n\nThe calculated probability of `43.926%` is closest to **44%**. Reviewing the options presented in the initial problem:\n\n*   A) 52%\n*   B) 48%\n*   C) 40%\n*   D) 44%\n\nThe correct choice is **D**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **The Memoryless Property is Essential:** The most common mistake in this type of problem is to wrongly assume that the atom is \"more likely\" to decay because time has passed. Recognizing and applying the memoryless property is the key to solving the problem correctly.\n2.  **Survival vs. Decay Probability:** It is often computationally simpler to work with the survival probability `S(t)` as an intermediate step, rather than the decay probability `P(t)`. One must be careful not to confuse the two in the final answer (i.e., not to answer with `0.56` instead of `1 - 0.56`).\n3.  **Exponent Rules:** Correctly using the property of exponents (`e^(-at) = (e^(-t))^a`) is the mathematical shortcut that makes the calculation straightforward without having to find the decay constant `λ`.\n4.  **Reading the Question:** The question asks for the probability of decay *in the next 150 minutes*, which, due to the memoryless nature, is equivalent to the probability of decay over any 150-minute interval.\n\nThe unanimous agreement among all 15 agents on the core principle and the calculation provides very high confidence in the result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the reasoning provided by the candidate agents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle.** The question describes a radioactive decay process. The single most important concept, as identified by all candidate answers, is that this process is **\"memoryless.\"** This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models decay. The probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"due\" for decay.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question.** Because the process is memoryless, the condition that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant information for calculating the future probability. This is the most common trap in this type of problem. The question simplifies from a conditional probability to a direct one: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model.** The probability that an atom decays within a time interval `t` is given by the formula `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability of an atom surviving past time `t` is `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter.** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (a probability of 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    Instead of solving for `λ`, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes, which is a more useful value for the next step.\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability.** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can use our known survival probability and the properties of exponents to solve this:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from Step 4:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation.** Now we can find the final decay probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    First, calculate the value of the exponent:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    Then, calculate the final probability:\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n7.  **Compare to Options and Finalize.** The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to **43.926%**. We compare this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 44%\n    *   B) 52%\n    *   C) 40%\n    *   D) 48%\nThe calculated value of 43.926% is unequivocally closest to 44%.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common mistake is to think the 50 minutes of survival matter. They must be ignored. The atom's decay probability does not change over time.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay Probability:** It is crucial to distinguish between `P_decay(t)` and `P_survival(t)`. The calculation is most straightforward by first finding the survival probability `P_survival(100)=0.68` and using it to find `P_survival(150)`, before converting back to the decay probability at the end.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Correctly applying the rule `x^(a*b) = (x^a)^b` is the essential mathematical step that avoids the need to explicitly calculate the decay constant `λ`.\n*   **Approximation:** The final result is not an exact integer percentage. The final step is to select the *closest* answer choice, which in this case is 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of radioactive decay, a process governed by the exponential distribution.

The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**Step 2: Define the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability that an atom has survived (not decayed) for a duration `t` is given by the survival function:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant unique to the atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed within a duration `t` is:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**Step 3: Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n`P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the survival probability for 100 minutes, which is a more convenient parameter for calculation:\n`S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which, due to the memoryless property, is simply `P(150)`.\n`P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can use the value found in Step 3 by leveraging the properties of exponents:\n`S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nSubstituting the value from Step 3:\n`S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Answer**\nNow, we perform the final calculation for the decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nCalculating the value:\n1. `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n2. `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately `43.93%`.\n\n**Step 6: Select the Closest Option**\nWe compare the calculated value of `43.93%` to the provided options:\nA) 44%\nB) 52%\nC) 40%\nD) 48%\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Crucial**: The most common error in problems of this type is to incorrectly assume the atom \"ages,\" making it more likely to decay. The 50 minutes of past survival are irrelevant to the future.\n*   **Work with Survival Probability**: Converting the initial decay probability `P(100)` into a survival probability `S(100)` simplifies the subsequent calculations.\n*   **Use Exponent Rules**: The trick `S(150) = (S(100))^1.5` allows you to solve the problem without explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ`, which is more efficient and less prone to rounding errors.\n*   **Select the Closest Value**: As is common in physics problems, the calculated result is not exactly one of the options.

Therefore, `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - S(100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can easily find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value, `S(100)`, is the key parameter needed for the next step.
