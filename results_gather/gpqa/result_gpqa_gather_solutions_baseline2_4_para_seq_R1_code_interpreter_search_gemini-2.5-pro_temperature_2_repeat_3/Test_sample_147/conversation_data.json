We can set up an equation using the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the unknown molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    `ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`\n2.  Plugging in the value and rearranging to solve for M(Y) yields the relationship:\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n3.  We test small integer values for `n`, which represents the oxidation state of Y:\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n4.  To verify, we can use the other clues. The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous, powerful oxidizing agent that fits this description. This chemical property strongly supports the identification of Y as Sb.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** Element Y is Antimony (Sb), and substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4 Using Reaction Stoichiometry**\nA4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. We need to use the reaction clues to identify it. The most common candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\n1.  The key clue is: \"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n2.  This describes the reaction: `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  Let's test our two main candidates for A4:\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** If A4 were antimony pentafluoride, this would be a comproportionation reaction. The known, balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of the reactants is 2:3, which **contradicts** the explicit 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a perfect **1:1 molar ratio**, which exactly matches the clue.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:** Based on the explicit stoichiometric information, substance A4 must be Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\nNow that we have confidently identified A4 as SbF₃, we can calculate its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Molecular Weight Calculation:**\n    `MW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**`\n2.  **Matching to Provided Options:**\n    The problem provides the following ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n3.

Using the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), we can derive the relationship for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    Rearranging this equation gives: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   **Identifying the Element:** Testing integer values for `n`, the most plausible result is for n=3:\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`.\n    This value is an exceptional match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   **Verification:** The clue that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon strongly supports this identification. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous superacid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon, a property not typical of other candidates like Dysprosium.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1:** Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**, and substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\nThe next critical step is to identify A4 using the provided reaction stoichiometry.\n*   **The Stoichiometric Clue:** A5 is formed \"by adding Y (Sb) in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\"\n*   **The Reaction:** `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the ratio of Sb:A4 is 1:1.\n*   **Testing Candidates for A4:** A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony. The two most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of reactants is **2:3**, which directly **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃.** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem's clue. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride, which aligns with the description of five known fluorides and its decomposition in water.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2:** Based on the explicit stoichiometric information, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\nNow that A4 has been confidently identified, the final step is a straightforward calculation.\n*   **Compound:** A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n*   **Molecular Weight Calculation:**\n    `MW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**`\n*   **Matching to Options:** We compare this calculated value to the given ranges in the question:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 110-130\n*   The value of 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within the range of **160-180**.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis, supported by the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers, leads to a single, consistent conclusion. The molecular weight of A4 is ~178.76 g/mol, which belongs to the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the candidate solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y) using Quantitative Data**\nThe most reliable starting point is the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in substance A2, which is given as 31.96%.\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nPlugging in the given values and rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\nThis leads to the relationship: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe now test plausible integer values for n:\n*   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for the element **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\nTo confirm this, the theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.00) ≈ 31.88%`, which is very close to the given value of 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Corroborate the Identification of Y using Chemical Clues**\nThe problem states that compounds A1 and A3 can oxidize or interact with xenon. This indicates a very strong oxidizing and fluorinating agent. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous superacid and one of the strongest Lewis acids, well-known for its ability to react with and oxidize xenon. This chemical property strongly supports the identification of Y as Antimony. Other potential candidates (like Dysprosium from n=4) do not fit this chemical description. Therefore, we can be highly confident that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance A4 using Reaction Stoichiometry**\nThe next critical clue is the formation of A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   Since Y is Sb, the reaction is: `Sb + A4 → A5`\n*   The reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n*   A4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n\nWe must test which candidate for A4 fits the 1:1 stoichiometry:\n*   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅**. This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known, balanced equation for this reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants are in a 2:3 molar ratio, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n*   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃**. The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem's description. The product (A5) would be an antimony subfluoride, fitting the description of being one of the five known compounds.\n\nThis analysis unambiguously shows that substance **A4 is SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\nNow that we have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we calculate its molecular weight:\n*   MW(A4) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 × 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value to the options provided in the original question:\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y)**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the quantitative data provided for substance A2: its fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) is 31.96%.\n*   Let the chemical formula for A2 be YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The mass percentage formula is: `ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))`.\n*   Plugging in the known values and rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y) gives the relationship:\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n*   We test plausible integer values for n:\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptionally close match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   To verify this, we use the additional clue that A1 and A3 can interact with or oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous, powerful oxidizing agent that reacts with xenon. This strongly supports the identification of Y as antimony.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1**: Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**, and substance A2, with the formula YF₃, is **SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance A4**\n\nThe next quantitative clue relates to the formation of substance A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   Since Y is Antimony (Sb), the reaction is: `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n*   A4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We must determine which one fits the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Case 1 (A4 = SbF₅)**: This reaction would be a comproportionation. The well-known balanced chemical equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants are in a 2:3 ratio, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2 (A4 = SbF₃)**: The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem's description. The product A5 would be an antimony subfluoride, which plausibly fits the description of the remaining compounds.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2**: Based on the explicit stoichiometric requirement, substance **A4 must be SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we can calculate its molecular weight.\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated molecular weight to the given ranges in the original question:\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 140-160\n*   C) 110-130\n*   D) 160-180\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the problem's clues. The reasoning presented in all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and converges on the same logical path.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y)\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data: substance A2, a binary compound of Y and Fluorine (F), contains 31.96% fluorine by mass.\n\n1.  **Set up the formula:** Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by:\n    ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n\n2.  **Solve for M(Y):** Plugging in the known values and rearranging gives the relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n):\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    This yields: **M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n**\n\n3.  **Test for integer n:** We test small, chemically plausible integers for n.\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with chemical clues:** The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous superacid and a powerful enough oxidant to react with xenon, a property not commonly found in the fluorides of other candidate elements (like Dysprosium, n=4). This strongly confirms that Y is Antimony.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Y = Antimony (Sb), and A2 = Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4\n\nThe next critical clue is the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5: \"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n1.  **Set up the reaction:** Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the ratio of the reactants Sb:A4 is 1:1.\n2.  **Identify candidates for A4:** A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n3.  **Test the candidates against the stoichiometry:**\n    *   **If A4 = SbF₅:** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given.\n    *   **If A4 = SbF₃:** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem statement. The product (A5) would be an antimony subfluoride, fitting the description of one of the five compounds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The only identification for A4 consistent with the problem's quantitative data is **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nNow that we have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we calculate its molecular weight.\n\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = Molar Mass of Sb + (3 × Molar Mass of F)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 g/mol + (3 × 19.00 g/mol)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Select the Correct Range\n\nThe final step is to find which of the provided ranges contains our calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol.\n\n*   A) 140-160\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 220-240\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y) using Quantitative Data\n\nThe most reliable piece of information in the problem is quantitative: substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%.\n\n1.  **Set up the formula**: The mass percentage of fluorine is given by the equation:\n    `ωF = (n * Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n * Molar Mass of F)`\n    Using the molar mass of fluorine (F) as ~19.00 g/mol, we have:\n    `0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)`\n\n2.  **Solve for M(Y)**: Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y gives the relationship:\n    `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\n3.  **Test integer values for n**: We test plausible integer values for n (the oxidation state) to find a matching element:\n    *   For n=3, `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This is an extremely close match for the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   A check confirms the high quality of this match: The theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is `(3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) ≈ 31.88%`, which is very near the given 31.96%.\n\n4.  **Corroborate with chemical clues**: The problem states that compounds A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a known superacid and one of the few reagents that can oxidize xenon. This strongly supports the identification of Y as Antimony.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1**: All provided candidate answers correctly and unanimously identify element Y as Antimony (Sb), and thus substance A2 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry\n\nA second quantitative clue is provided to identify A4: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n1.  **Define the reaction**: Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n2.  **Evaluate candidates for A4**: A4 is another binary fluoride of Antimony, making the most likely candidates SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   **Case 1: A4 = SbF₅**. This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactants have a 2:3 molar ratio, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: A4 = SbF₃**. The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. This **perfectly matches** the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2**: The strict stoichiometric clue forces the conclusion that substance **A4 is SbF₃**. This deduction is also consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Correct Range\n\nNow that substance A4 has been identified as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), the final step is to calculate its molecular weight and match it to the given options.\n\n1.  **Calculate Molecular Weight**:\n    `MW(A4) = MW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F)`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 3 * 19.00 g/mol`\n    `MW(A4) = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol`\n\n2.  **Match to Provided Ranges**: We compare the calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol to the options listed in the question:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 140-160\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n\n**Final Answer Decision**: The logical path, relying on the two strongest quantitative clues (mass percentage and reaction stoichiometry), leads unambiguously to the identification of A4 as SbF₃. Its calculated molecular weight fits perfectly into only one of the provided ranges (160-180 g/mol), which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y) using Quantitative Data\n\nThe most reliable piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in substance A2, which is given as 31.96%.\n\n1.  **Set up the formula:** Let the substance A2 be denoted by the formula YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and the molar mass of fluorine M(F) is ~19.00 g/mol.\n2.  **Mass Percentage Equation:** The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = [n × M(F)] / [M(Y) + n × M(F)]\n3.  **Solve for M(Y):** Plugging in the values and rearranging the equation gives a direct relationship between the molar mass of Y and the integer n:\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    This simplifies to: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n4.  **Test integer values for n:**\n    *   For n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n5.  **Verify the identification:** The chemical properties mentioned provide further support. The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid that reacts with xenon, making Sb a highly plausible candidate. Therefore, we can confidently conclude **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4 using Stoichiometry\n\nThe next crucial clue is the reaction used to form substance A5: \"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n1.  **The reaction is:** Sb + A4 → A5 (with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n2.  **Candidates for A4:** A4 is another binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common and stable possibilities are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n3.  **Test the candidates against the 1:1 ratio:**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: A4 = SbF₅.** This would be a comproportionation reaction.

The reasoning presented in all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and converges on the same logical path.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element (Y)\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data: substance A2, a binary compound of Y and Fluorine (F), contains 31.96% fluorine by mass.\n\n1.  **Set up the formula:** Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by:\n    ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n\n2.  **Solve for M(Y):** Plugging in the known values and rearranging gives the relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n):\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    This yields: **M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n**\n\n3.  **Test for integer n:** We test small, chemically plausible integers for n.\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an exceptional match for **Antimony (Sb)**, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Confirmation with chemical clues:** The problem states that A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a famous superacid and a powerful enough oxidant to react with xenon, a property not commonly found in the fluorides of other candidate elements (like Dysprosium, n=4). This strongly confirms that Y is Antimony.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Y = Antimony (Sb), and A2 = Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Substance A4\n\nThe next critical clue is the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5: \"By adding Y in a **1:1 molar ratio** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n1.  **Set up the reaction:** Since Y is Sb, the reaction is `Sb + A4 → A5`, where the ratio of the reactants Sb:A4 is 1:1.\n2.  **Identify candidates for A4:** A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony. The two most common stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n3.  **Test the candidates against the stoichiometry:**\n    *   **If A4 = SbF₅:** This would be a comproportionation reaction. The known balanced equation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, which **contradicts** the 1:1 ratio given.\n    *   **If A4 = SbF₃:** The reaction would be `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. Here, the reactants are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, which **perfectly matches** the problem statement. The product (A5) would be an antimony subfluoride, fitting the description of one of the five compounds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The only identification for A4 consistent with the problem's quantitative data is **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nNow that we have definitively identified A4 as Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), we calculate its molecular weight.\n\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = Molar Mass of Sb + (3 × Molar Mass of F)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 g/mol + (3 × 19.00 g/mol)\n*   Molar Mass of A4 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Select the Correct Range\n\nThe final step is to find which of the provided ranges contains our calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol.\n\n*   A) 140-160\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 220-240\n\nThe calculated value of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.
