This analysis relies on identifying chirality in each molecule. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks key symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule where all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions) are substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these substituents creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, is a form of axial chirality. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon atom is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus **it shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅, a symmetrical ketone.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule does not possess any chiral centers. More importantly, it has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O double bond and bisects the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the geometry of the double bond. This planarity means it has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). Additionally, it possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Careful Points & Summary:**\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning:** All provided candidate answers arrive at the exact same conclusion for each individual compound, demonstrating a strong consensus on the underlying scientific principles.\n*   **Final Conclusion from Reasoning:** The analysis unanimously shows that only compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are both achiral due to having planes of symmetry.\n*   **Matching with Options:** The task is to find the option that lists only compounds 1 and 2.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct option that matches the conclusion is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Scientific Principle**\n\nThe question requires identifying which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon the original molecule. The most reliable way to determine chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Conversely, the presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Individually**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four groups at the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are large and bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). Their size creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four unique groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, and thus it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The molecule is planar. Due to its structure, it possesses two key symmetry elements:\n        1.  A **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself).\n        2.  A **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, and thus it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Address Careful Points**\n\n*   **Summary of Analysis:** Compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n*   **Consensus from Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers provide correct and unanimous scientific reasoning. They all correctly identify that compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism, compound 2 has a chiral center, and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to symmetry. This provides extremely high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Key Careful Point:** The candidate answers, despite agreeing on the scientific reasoning (i.e., that compounds 1 and 2 are the answer), select different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates they were likely presented with different ordering of the multiple-choice options. The final decision must rely on the consistent scientific reasoning, not the inconsistent final letter choice from the agents.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\n\nBased on the unambiguous chemical analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. We now match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe option that correctly lists compounds 1 and 2 is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the problem requires a step-by-step evaluation of each compound to determine if it is chiral, which is the prerequisite for exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Optical Isomerism**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most effective way to test for chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of either of these makes a molecule achiral. Chirality most commonly arises from:\n*   A **chiral center**: An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality**: Restricted rotation around a bond (atropisomerism) that creates a stable, non-planar chiral structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups (—NO₂ and —COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around the bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It possesses axial chirality and is therefore **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. It has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and also a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\n\n*   **Summary:** Compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not.\n*   **Careful Points from Candidate Analysis:** Every candidate answer provided the same correct reasoning, unanimously identifying compounds 1 and 2 as optically active and 3 and 4 as optically inactive. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) across candidates, despite their identical reasoning, indicates that they were likely evaluating against differently ordered options. The consensus in the scientific reasoning is overwhelmingly strong.\n*   **Final Decision:** The correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\nLooking at the options provided in the question:\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles reveals a clear and consistent conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The two most common causes of chirality relevant to this question are a chiral center and axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Each Compound**:\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) in the *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, locking the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape. This shape lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule **chiral** and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule possesses a **chiral center**. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a carbon atom with four different substituents, the molecule is **chiral** and optically active.\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**: This molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and thus not optically active.\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule (*trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) is planar. Its molecular plane acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n### Careful Points and Consensus\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus**: The reasoning provided across all 15 candidate answers is remarkably consistent and scientifically correct. Every single one concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (and for the correct reasons: atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (due to their symmetry).\n*   **Conclusion from Analysis**: The analysis confirms that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n*   **Discrepancy in Option Letters**: The final letter chosen (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidate answers. However, their detailed explanations unanimously identify \"1 and 2\" as the correct set of compounds. This discrepancy is clearly due to the agents being presented with shuffled option labels, not any disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The strength of the final decision should rely on the unanimous chemical reasoning, not the inconsistent final letter.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct scientific reasoning, the answer must be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. Looking at the options provided in the prompt:\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe option that correctly lists the optically active compounds is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo decide the final answer, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles involved and consider the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Condition for Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most effective way to determine chirality is to check for the absence of key symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. All four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (*ortho* positions) are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These large groups cause severe steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. It does not have any chiral centers. We check for symmetry. The molecule has a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Fumarate\" indicates the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This planarity means the molecule itself lies on a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points from Candidate Answer Analysis\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers provide the correct and identical chemical analysis. Every agent correctly concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n2.  **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers give a variety of final letter choices (A, B, C, D). This inconsistency is superficial and is almost certainly due to the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent.\n3.  **Consensus as the Strongest Signal:** The crucial observation is the unanimous consensus on the scientific reasoning. This provides very high confidence that the correct conclusion is that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n4.  **Final Mapping:** Based on the robust analysis, the correct answer is the set {1, 2}. This must be matched to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 2 and 3\n    B) 1 and 2\n    C) 3 and 4\n    D) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct combination, \"1 and 2,\" corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a careful evaluation of the candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the scientific question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four given chemical compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The analysis involves examining each molecule for sources of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) and for the presence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) which would make it achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning for each compound based on candidate consensus**\nThere is a complete and unanimous consensus in the chemical reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the analysis.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify this as a substituted biphenyl with bulky groups at the four ortho-positions. This creates severe steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the central bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is non-planar and lacks any key symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly recognize that this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) is highly symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** passing through the central C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This geometry means it has a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis and identify careful points**\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** Based on the unanimous and correct reasoning, only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies significantly across the candidate answers. This is a crucial point to note. It does not indicate a disagreement in the chemical analysis, but rather suggests that the multiple-choice options were likely presented in a different order to each candidate.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Because the scientific reasoning is universally consistent, it should be trusted as the sole basis for the final answer. The inconsistent final letter choices from the candidates should be disregarded.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nThe correct answer must be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We now match this firm conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo decide on the final answer, a thorough analysis of the question and the candidate answers is required. The process involves verifying the scientific principles and observing the consensus among the agents.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The task is to identify which of the four listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism. This is a property exclusive to **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon itself. The presence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** A biphenyl molecule with four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) located on the positions immediately adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions).\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four attached groups are different, the C-2 atom is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be visualized passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.

The molecule is planar due to the geometry of the double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule possesses two key symmetry elements that make it achiral:\n        *   A plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself).\n        *   A center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** The analysis above is consistent with the reasoning provided by all 15 candidate answers. There is a unanimous and correct agreement on the scientific facts: Compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and optically active, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and not optically active.\n*   **Final Answer Combination:** Based on this unwavering consensus, the correct answer must be the choice that includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n*   **Discrepancy in Lettered Choices:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, D). This should be considered a procedural artifact, likely due to variations in how the multiple-choice options were lettered for each agent. The critical takeaway is that their underlying reasoning is identical and sound.\n*   **Final Decision:** The decision must be based on the correct scientific conclusion. We must select the option from the provided list that matches our finding.\n\n**Conclusion:** Compounds 1 and 2 are the only ones that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options:\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers, here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the final correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Scientific Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the core principle: a compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This lack of superimposability is due to an absence of specific symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The analysis must therefore focus on identifying these properties for each compound.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Consensus Reasoning**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All candidate answers agree that the large, bulky groups on the *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. All agents correctly conclude it is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This carbon is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. All agents correctly conclude it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this molecule as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the carbon-oxygen double bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. All agents correctly conclude it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This planarity itself creates a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the molecule possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. All agents correctly conclude it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Address Careful Points**\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** There is a 100% unanimous agreement in the reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. All conclude that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral and do not. This high level of consensus on the chemical principles provides strong confidence in the result.\n*   **Option Letter Discrepancy:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the letter assigned to the correct combination (\"1 and 2\") varied in the prompts given to each agent. This is a superficial error and should be disregarded. The decision must be based on the correct chemical conclusion, not the inconsistent letter.\n*   **Final Correct Combination:** The only logical conclusion supported by the unanimous analysis is that the correct answer is the set containing **compounds 1 and 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Final Answer**\nWe must now match our conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Scientific Question**\nThe task is to identify which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key to solving this problem is to analyze each molecule for features of chirality or, conversely, for symmetry elements that would make it achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance between these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** We must examine the structure for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. There are no chiral centers. Most importantly, the molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** The term \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This geometry creates symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes it achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Evaluate Candidate Answers**\n\n*   The analysis shows that **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.\n*   Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n*   All 15 candidate answers present this exact same line of reasoning. There is a complete and unanimous consensus on the scientific facts of the case.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Consensus:** The most crucial observation is the unanimous agreement across all candidate answers on the scientific reasoning. They all correctly identify that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while 3 and 4 are not.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** The chirality of compound 1 is a classic example of atropisomerism (a type of axial chirality), which is a more advanced concept than simple chiral centers. All candidates correctly identified this.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The candidate answers propose different final letters (A, B, C, D) despite having identical reasoning. This is strong evidence that they were working from different versions of the multiple-choice question where the option labels were scrambled. Therefore, the reasoning, not the final letter, should be trusted.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Answer**\nBased on the consistent and correct scientific analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. The options provided in the prompt are:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe option that matches the conclusion is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nA detailed analysis of the question and the candidate answers reveals a clear path to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to identify which of the four given compounds are chiral, as chiral molecules are the ones that exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. This can be determined by looking for sources of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** This is a substituted biphenyl where all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are occupied by large, bulky groups.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The severe steric hindrance between these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, is a form of axial chirality. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it **chiral**. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The carbon at position 2 is attached to: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center is sufficient to make the molecule **chiral**. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Key Feature:** The structure is a symmetrical ketone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be visualized passing through the C=O double bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The molecule is planar due to the geometry of the C=C double bond. This means the molecular plane itself is a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the structure has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Result:** The analysis definitively shows that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Candidate Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers presented a perfect and unanimous consensus on the scientific reasoning. Every agent correctly identified compounds 1 and 2 as optically active and compounds 3 and 4 as optically inactive for the correct chemical reasons. This provides extremely high confidence in the analysis.\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choices:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, or D). This inconsistency is not due to flawed chemical reasoning but is almost certainly an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The core conclusion—that the correct compounds are 1 and 2—remains universal across all of them.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unambiguous chemical analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We now match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe question asks to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. This property is confirmed by the absence of specific symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The most common causes of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or a fixed molecular asymmetry like axial chirality.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\nA consistent analysis across all candidate answers provides a clear breakdown for each compound.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. All four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions) are substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around this bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted shape lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four completely different groups: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This carbon atom is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Identify Careful Points**\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** There is a complete and correct consensus across all 15 candidate answers. Every single one provides the correct scientific reasoning, identifying compounds 1 and 2 as chiral (and thus optically active) and compounds 3 and 4 as achiral (and thus not optically active).\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter:** The final letter chosen by the candidates varies (A, B, C, D). However, the textual content of their answers consistently states that \"1 and 2\" is the correct combination. This strongly indicates that the discrepancy is not due to a failure in their chemical analysis, but rather due to the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) being presented to them in a different or scrambled order.\n*   **Conclusion Based on Consensus:** The strength and unanimity of the chemical reasoning is the most reliable signal. All analyses point to the same conclusion: only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nBased on the comprehensive and unanimous analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Question**: The question asks to identify which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key elements of symmetry, specifically a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus in Candidate Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers, despite sometimes arriving at different letter choices, present a completely uniform and scientifically correct analysis of each compound. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the underlying reasoning. Let's summarize this unanimous reasoning:\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four large groups at the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents free rotation around the central single bond connecting the two rings, a phenomenon called **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted shape lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** To assess chirality, we look for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups:\n            1.  Hydrogen (-H)\n            2.  Hydroxyl (-OH)\n            3.  Methyl (-CH₃)\n            4.  Methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule as a whole is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. The molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** \"Fumarate\" denotes the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This structure has two key symmetry elements: the molecular plane itself is a plane of symmetry, and it also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: The unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n    *   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n    Therefore, the correct set of compounds is {1, 2}.\n\n4.  **Final Decision**: We now match this conclusion to the multiple-choice options provided in the initial problem description:\n    A) 1 and 2\n    B) 1, 2 and 4\n    C) 3 and 4\n    D) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination {1, 2} corresponds to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning:** The most critical observation is that the scientific logic presented by all candidate agents is identical and correct. They all agree that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral while 3 and 4 are achiral.\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choice:** The candidate answers end with different letters (A, B, C, D). This is a superficial error likely caused by the agents receiving versions of the question with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The final decision must rely on the strong scientific consensus, not the inconsistent final letter.\n*   **Types of Chirality:** The problem correctly highlights two distinct sources of chirality: a chiral center (in compound 2) and axial chirality/atropisomerism (in compound 1).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide on the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of each compound is required. This analysis will be based on the fundamental principles of stereochemistry and will take into account the consensus reasoning presented in the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The key to determining chirality is to look for specific structural features:\n*   **Sources of Chirality**: The most common are a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and **axial chirality** (chirality due to restricted rotation about a bond, as seen in atropisomers).\n*   **Elements of Symmetry**: The presence of a **plane of symmetry** (an imaginary plane that bisects the molecule into two identical mirror-image halves) or a **center of inversion** (a point in the molecule's center from which any atom can be reflected through to an identical atom on the opposite side) makes a molecule **achiral** and thus, not optically active.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a biphenyl molecule with four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, 6'). The severe steric hindrance between these groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group) for chirality. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral**, and it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers. Most importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be passed through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis**: \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers provide the same, correct chemical reasoning. They unanimously agree that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (and thus show optical isomerism) and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (and do not). This provides very high confidence in the scientific conclusion.\n*   **Inconsistency in Final Letters**: The candidate answers provide different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options they were presented with were likely in different orders. Therefore, the final letter choice from the candidates is unreliable.\n*   **Final Decision Strategy**: The decision must be based on the unanimous scientific conclusion and matched against the specific options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   Compound 1: **Shows** optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: **Shows** optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: **Does not** show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: **Does not** show optical isomerism.\n\nThe correct choice is the option that includes only compounds 1 and 2.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The key to determining chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of such symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Individually\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance from these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a type of axial chirality. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. In the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule as a whole is chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and does not possess any chiral centers. Crucially, it has a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. As a planar molecule, it inherently possesses a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize Results and Identify Careful Points\n\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The analysis shows that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Candidate Answer Consensus:** All of the provided candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, share the exact same scientific reasoning.

The four groups at the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are large and bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃).

This restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

They all correctly identify that compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism, compound 2 has a chiral center, and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to symmetry. This provides extremely high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Key Careful Point:** The candidate answers, despite agreeing on the scientific reasoning (i.e., that compounds 1 and 2 are the answer), select different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates they were likely presented with different ordering of the multiple-choice options. The final decision must rely on the consistent scientific reasoning, not the inconsistent final letter choice from the agents.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\n\nBased on the unambiguous chemical analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most effective way to test for chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, specifically a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of either of these makes a molecule achiral. Chirality most commonly arises from:\n*   A **chiral center**: An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality**: Restricted rotation around a bond (atropisomerism) that creates a stable, non-planar chiral structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups (—NO₂ and —COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around the bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It possesses axial chirality and is therefore **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for a chiral center.

The molecule is therefore **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical. It has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar.

Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not.\n*   **Careful Points from Candidate Analysis:** Every candidate answer provided the same correct reasoning, unanimously identifying compounds 1 and 2 as optically active and 3 and 4 as optically inactive. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) across candidates, despite their identical reasoning, indicates that they were likely evaluating against differently ordered options. The consensus in the scientific reasoning is overwhelmingly strong.\n*   **Final Decision:** The correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\nLooking at the options provided in the question:\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles reveals a clear and consistent conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The two most common causes of chirality relevant to this question are a chiral center and axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Each Compound**:\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) in the *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, locking the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape. This shape lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule **chiral** and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule possesses a **chiral center**. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a carbon atom with four different substituents, the molecule is **chiral** and optically active.\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**: This molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and thus not optically active.\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule (*trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃) is planar. Its molecular plane acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n### Careful Points and Consensus\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus**: The reasoning provided across all 15 candidate answers is remarkably consistent and scientifically correct. Every single one concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (and for the correct reasons: atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (due to their symmetry).\n*   **Conclusion from Analysis**: The analysis confirms that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n*   **Discrepancy in Option Letters**: The final letter chosen (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidate answers. However, their detailed explanations unanimously identify \"1 and 2\" as the correct set of compounds. This discrepancy is clearly due to the agents being presented with shuffled option labels, not any disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The strength of the final decision should rely on the unanimous chemical reasoning, not the inconsistent final letter.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct scientific reasoning, the answer must be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.

These large groups cause severe steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups.

Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Fumarate\" indicates the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This planarity means the molecule itself lies on a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points from Candidate Answer Analysis\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers provide the correct and identical chemical analysis. Every agent correctly concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n2.  **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers give a variety of final letter choices (A, B, C, D).

This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is non-planar and lacks any key symmetry elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly recognize that this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) is highly symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** passing through the central C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This geometry means it has a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis and identify careful points**\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** Based on the unanimous and correct reasoning, only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies significantly across the candidate answers.

This is a property exclusive to **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon itself. The presence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** A biphenyl molecule with four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) located on the positions immediately adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions).\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four attached groups are different, the C-2 atom is a chiral center.

More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be visualized passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The molecule is planar due to the geometry of the double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule possesses two key symmetry elements that make it achiral:\n        *   A plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself).\n        *   A center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** The analysis above is consistent with the reasoning provided by all 15 candidate answers. There is a unanimous and correct agreement on the scientific facts: Compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and optically active, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and not optically active.\n*   **Final Answer Combination:** Based on this unwavering consensus, the correct answer must be the choice that includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n*   **Discrepancy in Lettered Choices:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, D). This should be considered a procedural artifact, likely due to variations in how the multiple-choice options were lettered for each agent. The critical takeaway is that their underlying reasoning is identical and sound.\n*   **Final Decision:** The decision must be based on the correct scientific conclusion. We must select the option from the provided list that matches our finding.\n\n**Conclusion:** Compounds 1 and 2 are the only ones that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options:\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers, here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the final correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Scientific Principle**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the core principle: a compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This lack of superimposability is due to an absence of specific symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The analysis must therefore focus on identifying these properties for each compound.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Consensus Reasoning**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All candidate answers agree that the large, bulky groups on the *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. All agents correctly conclude it is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This carbon is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. All agents correctly conclude it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this molecule as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the carbon-oxygen double bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. All agents correctly conclude it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This planarity itself creates a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the molecule possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. All agents correctly conclude it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Address Careful Points**\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** There is a 100% unanimous agreement in the reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. All conclude that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral and do not. This high level of consensus on the chemical principles provides strong confidence in the result.\n*   **Option Letter Discrepancy:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the letter assigned to the correct combination (\"1 and 2\") varied in the prompts given to each agent. This is a superficial error and should be disregarded. The decision must be based on the correct chemical conclusion, not the inconsistent letter.\n*   **Final Correct Combination:** The only logical conclusion supported by the unanimous analysis is that the correct answer is the set containing **compounds 1 and 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Final Answer**\nWe must now match our conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Scientific Question**\nThe task is to identify which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key to solving this problem is to analyze each molecule for features of chirality or, conversely, for symmetry elements that would make it achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance between these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon, called **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** We must examine the structure for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. There are no chiral centers. Most importantly, the molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Analysis:** The term \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This geometry creates symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes it achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Results and Evaluate Candidate Answers**\n\n*   The analysis shows that **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.\n*   Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n*   All 15 candidate answers present this exact same line of reasoning. There is a complete and unanimous consensus on the scientific facts of the case.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Consensus:** The most crucial observation is the unanimous agreement across all candidate answers on the scientific reasoning. They all correctly identify that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while 3 and 4 are not.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** The chirality of compound 1 is a classic example of atropisomerism (a type of axial chirality), which is a more advanced concept than simple chiral centers. All candidates correctly identified this.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The candidate answers propose different final letters (A, B, C, D) despite having identical reasoning. This is strong evidence that they were working from different versions of the multiple-choice question where the option labels were scrambled. Therefore, the reasoning, not the final letter, should be trusted.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Answer**\nBased on the consistent and correct scientific analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. The options provided in the prompt are:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe option that matches the conclusion is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nA detailed analysis of the question and the candidate answers reveals a clear path to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to identify which of the four given compounds are chiral, as chiral molecules are the ones that exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. This can be determined by looking for sources of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** This is a substituted biphenyl where all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are occupied by large, bulky groups.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The severe steric hindrance between these groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, is a form of axial chirality. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it **chiral**. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The carbon at position 2 is attached to: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center is sufficient to make the molecule **chiral**. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Key Feature:** The structure is a symmetrical ketone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This molecule has no chiral centers. More importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be visualized passing through the C=O double bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Key Feature:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The molecule is planar due to the geometry of the C=C double bond. This means the molecular plane itself is a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the structure has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Result:** The analysis definitively shows that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Candidate Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers presented a perfect and unanimous consensus on the scientific reasoning. Every agent correctly identified compounds 1 and 2 as optically active and compounds 3 and 4 as optically inactive for the correct chemical reasons. This provides extremely high confidence in the analysis.\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choices:** The candidate answers selected different final letters (A, B, C, or D). This inconsistency is not due to flawed chemical reasoning but is almost certainly an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different order for each agent. The core conclusion—that the correct compounds are 1 and 2—remains universal across all of them.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unambiguous chemical analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We now match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe question asks to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. This property is confirmed by the absence of specific symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). The most common causes of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or a fixed molecular asymmetry like axial chirality.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\nA consistent analysis across all candidate answers provides a clear breakdown for each compound.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. All four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions) are substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around this bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted shape lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four completely different groups: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This carbon atom is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated ester. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Identify Careful Points**\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** There is a complete and correct consensus across all 15 candidate answers. Every single one provides the correct scientific reasoning, identifying compounds 1 and 2 as chiral (and thus optically active) and compounds 3 and 4 as achiral (and thus not optically active).\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter:** The final letter chosen by the candidates varies (A, B, C, D). However, the textual content of their answers consistently states that \"1 and 2\" is the correct combination. This strongly indicates that the discrepancy is not due to a failure in their chemical analysis, but rather due to the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) being presented to them in a different or scrambled order.\n*   **Conclusion Based on Consensus:** The strength and unanimity of the chemical reasoning is the most reliable signal. All analyses point to the same conclusion: only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nBased on the comprehensive and unanimous analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Question**: The question asks to identify which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This means the molecule must lack key elements of symmetry, specifically a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus in Candidate Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers, despite sometimes arriving at different letter choices, present a completely uniform and scientifically correct analysis of each compound. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the underlying reasoning. Let's summarize this unanimous reasoning:\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four large groups at the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents free rotation around the central single bond connecting the two rings, a phenomenon called **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted shape lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** To assess chirality, we look for a chiral center. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups:\n            1.  Hydrogen (-H)\n            2.  Hydroxyl (-OH)\n            3.  Methyl (-CH₃)\n            4.  Methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule as a whole is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. The molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** \"Fumarate\" denotes the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This structure has two key symmetry elements: the molecular plane itself is a plane of symmetry, and it also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: The unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n    *   Compound **1** shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **2** shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **3** does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound **4** does not show optical isomerism.\n    Therefore, the correct set of compounds is {1, 2}.\n\n4.  **Final Decision**: We now match this conclusion to the multiple-choice options provided in the initial problem description:\n    A) 1 and 2\n    B) 1, 2 and 4\n    C) 3 and 4\n    D) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination {1, 2} corresponds to option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning:** The most critical observation is that the scientific logic presented by all candidate agents is identical and correct. They all agree that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral while 3 and 4 are achiral.\n*   **Discrepancy in Letter Choice:** The candidate answers end with different letters (A, B, C, D). This is a superficial error likely caused by the agents receiving versions of the question with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The final decision must rely on the strong scientific consensus, not the inconsistent final letter.\n*   **Types of Chirality:** The problem correctly highlights two distinct sources of chirality: a chiral center (in compound 2) and axial chirality/atropisomerism (in compound 1).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo decide on the final answer, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of each compound is required. This analysis will be based on the fundamental principles of stereochemistry and will take into account the consensus reasoning presented in the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The key to determining chirality is to look for specific structural features:\n*   **Sources of Chirality**: The most common are a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and **axial chirality** (chirality due to restricted rotation about a bond, as seen in atropisomers).\n*   **Elements of Symmetry**: The presence of a **plane of symmetry** (an imaginary plane that bisects the molecule into two identical mirror-image halves) or a **center of inversion** (a point in the molecule's center from which any atom can be reflected through to an identical atom on the opposite side) makes a molecule **achiral** and thus, not optically active.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a biphenyl molecule with four large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, 6'). The severe steric hindrance between these groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group) for chirality. It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral**, and it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers. Most importantly, it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be passed through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis**: \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consensus on Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers provide the same, correct chemical reasoning. They unanimously agree that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral (and thus show optical isomerism) and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral (and do not). This provides very high confidence in the scientific conclusion.\n*   **Inconsistency in Final Letters**: The candidate answers provide different final letters (A, B, C, D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options they were presented with were likely in different orders. Therefore, the final letter choice from the candidates is unreliable.\n*   **Final Decision Strategy**: The decision must be based on the unanimous scientific conclusion and matched against the specific options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   Compound 1: **Shows** optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: **Shows** optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: **Does not** show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: **Does not** show optical isomerism.\n\nThe correct choice is the option that includes only compounds 1 and 2. Matching this with the options provided:\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe conclusion \"1 and 2\" directly corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fundamental Principle\nThe question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit **optical isomerism**. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The key to determining chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of such symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Individually\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance from these groups prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a type of axial chirality. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. In the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule as a whole is chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and does not possess any chiral centers. Crucially, it has a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. As a planar molecule, it inherently possesses a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Additionally, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize Results and Identify Careful Points\n\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The analysis shows that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Candidate Answer Consensus:** All of the provided candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, share the exact same scientific reasoning. There is a unanimous agreement that:\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active due to atropisomerism.\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active due to a chiral center.\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral due to both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter:** The variation in the final letters chosen by the candidates (A, B, C, D) is not a result of flawed chemical reasoning. It strongly suggests that the options were lettered differently for each candidate, causing confusion in the final step of matching the correct conclusion to a letter. The unwavering consensus on the chemical facts provides high confidence in the result.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the robust and unanimous scientific analysis, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. Reviewing the options provided in the prompt:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe option that correctly identifies the optically active compounds is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nA thorough analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemistry reveals a clear path to the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify which of the four compounds are chiral, as chirality is the prerequisite for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Analysis:** The significant steric hindrance from these substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four chemically distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). An atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** A symmetrical ketone with the formula C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅.\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an ester, *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points and Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** There is a complete consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the scientific analysis. Every single agent correctly identifies that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n*   **Identical Justifications:** The reasoning provided by every candidate is also identical: compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism (axial chirality), compound 2 has a chiral center, compound 3 has a plane of symmetry, and compound 4 has both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This represents an extremely high level of confidence in the scientific conclusion.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidate answers. This indicates that the multiple-choice options they were provided were shuffled, making their letter choice an unreliable guide. The only reliable signal is their unanimous reasoning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the flawless chemical analysis, which is unanimously supported by all candidate answers, the compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. We must now match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
