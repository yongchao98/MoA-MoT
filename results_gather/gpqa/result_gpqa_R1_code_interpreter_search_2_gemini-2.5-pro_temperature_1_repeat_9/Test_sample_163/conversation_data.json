    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Determine the Relevant Physics Principle:** The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars (K1 and K2). The key insight is that the systems are \"eclipsing.\" This means their orbital planes are viewed edge-on, so the inclination angle (i) is approximately 90 degrees, and therefore sin(i) is approximately 1.\n\n4.  **State the Formula:** The formula for the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)^3] / [2 * π * G * sin^3(i)]\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Formula for an Eclipsing System:** Since the systems are eclipsing, we assume i ≈ 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    M_total ≈ [P * (K1 + K2)^3] / [2 * π * G]\n\n6.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = ( [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [2 * π * G] ) / ( [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3] / [2 * π * G] )\n\n    The constant term (2 * π * G) cancels out, leaving a simple proportionality:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]\n\n7.  **Calculate the Values for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   Sum of amplitudes = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   Sum of amplitudes = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Ratio:** Substitute the values into the ratio formula. We can use the units as given (years and km/s) because they will cancel out.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\n\nI will now use Python to perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sum = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_sum = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The ratio of the masses is proportional to P * K_sum^3\n# M1/M2 = (P1 * K1_sum^3) / (P2 * K2_sum^3)\nratio = (P1 * (K1_sum**3)) / (P2 * (K2_sum**3))\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **System 1:** Period P1 = 2 years, Radial velocity amplitudes K1a = 10 km/s, K1b = 5 km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** Period P2 = 1 year, Radial velocity amplitudes K2a = 15 km/s, K2b = 10 km/s.\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** Both are \"eclipsing\" systems. This implies that their orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. Consequently, `sin(i)` is approximately 1.\n\n3.  **Select the Relevant Physical Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by the formula derived from Kepler's laws:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n    where:\n    *   P = orbital period\n    *   K1, K2 = semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves\n    *   G = gravitational constant\n    *   i = orbital inclination\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula:** Since the systems are eclipsing, we take `sin(i) ≈ 1`, so `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n    M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G)\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. When we divide the expression for M_total_1 by the expression for M_total_2, the constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]\n    This shows that the mass ratio depends only on the periods and the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Necessary Values:**\n    *   For System 1:\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocities (K_sum_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   For System 2:\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocities (K_sum_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:** Now, substitute these values into the ratio formula. I will use a short Python script for the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The ratio of the total masses is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# The constant (2*pi*G) cancels out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum**3)) / (P2 * (K2_sum**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
