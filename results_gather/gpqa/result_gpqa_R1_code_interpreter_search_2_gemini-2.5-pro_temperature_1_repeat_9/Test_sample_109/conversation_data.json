    "The user wants to determine which of the five listed stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory.\n\nFirst, let's establish the observability criteria for each instrument and observatory.\n\n**1. Observability Criteria:**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):**\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17.0 mag (m_V < 17.0).\n    *   **Location:** Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude ~24.6° S). Therefore, it can observe stars in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere (negative declinations) and stars in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere up to a certain positive declination. A reasonable approximation for the northern limit is `90° - |latitude|` = `90° - 24.6°` = `+65.4°`. So, for Paranal, the declination (DEC) must be less than approximately +65.4°.\n\n*   **HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory):**\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.0 mag (m_V < 16.0).\n    *   **Location:** The W. M. Keck Observatory is located in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude ~19.8° N). It can observe stars in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere (positive declinations) and stars in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere down to a certain negative declination. A reasonable approximation for the southern limit is `-90° + |latitude|` = `-90° + 19.8°` = `-70.2°`. So, for Keck, the declination (DEC) must be greater than approximately -70.2°.\n\n**Combined Criteria:**\nFor a star to be observable by **both** instruments, it must satisfy all conditions:\n1.  Apparent V magnitude (m_V) < 16.0 (the stricter of the two magnitude limits).\n2.  Declination (DEC) must be between approximately -70.2° and +65.4°.\n\nNext, let's calculate the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star and check its declination. The relationship between apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and extinction (A_V) is given by the distance modulus formula:\n`m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n\nThe extinction `A_V` is calculated from the color excess `E(B-V)` using the given relation `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   RA = 15 deg, **DEC = -75 deg**\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   Extinction (A_V) = 0 (not mentioned)\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination of -75° is below the limit for Keck Observatory (~ -70.2°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 1 cannot be observed by Keck.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   RA = 30 deg, DEC = 55 deg\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 mag**\n*   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude of 16.5 mag is fainter than the limit for HIRES (16.0 mag).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 2 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   RA = 11 h, **DEC = 48 deg** (Note: 11 h = 165 deg)\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 mag**\n*   E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 15 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination of +48° is within the range [-70.2°, +65.4°]. It is observable from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is brighter than 16.0 mag. It is observable by both spectrographs.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   RA = 85 deg, **DEC = -48 deg**\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n*   E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination of -48° is within the range [-70.2°, +65.4°]. It is observable from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`\n    *   `m_V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`\n    *   The apparent magnitude of 16.74 mag is fainter than the limit for HIRES (16.0 mag).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 4 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   RA = 10 h, **DEC = 60 deg** (Note: 10 h = 150 deg)\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   Extinction (A_V) = 0 (not mentioned)\n*   **Declination Check:** The declination of +60° is within the range [-70.2°, +65.4°]. It is observable from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   `m_V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0`\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag`\n    *   The apparent magnitude of ~15.0 mag is brighter than 16.0 mag. It is observable by both spectrographs.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Star 1: No (Declination)\n*   Star 2: No (Magnitude)\n*   **Star 3: Yes**\n*   Star 4: No (Magnitude)\n*   **Star 5: Yes**\n\nTherefore, only Star 3 and Star 5 can be detected with both spectrographs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
