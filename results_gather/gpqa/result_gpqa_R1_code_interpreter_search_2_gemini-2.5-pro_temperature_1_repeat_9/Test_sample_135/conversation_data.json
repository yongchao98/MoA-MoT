    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a specific volume `V`. The integral is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field and Volume:**\n    *   The vector field `f` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method:** The problem involves a volume integral of a divergence. The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the most appropriate tool for this. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    This theorem converts the volume integral over `V` into a surface integral over the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n\n4.  **Address the Singularity:**\n    *   The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` is undefined at the origin (`r = 0`). This is a singularity.\n    *   If we calculate the divergence directly for `r ≠ 0`:\n        In spherical coordinates, `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`.\n        Here, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n    *   So, the divergence is zero everywhere *except* at the origin. A naive integration of `0` over the volume would incorrectly give an answer of `0`.\n    *   The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this singularity. It relates the behavior of the field at the boundary (the surface) to the net \"source\" or \"sink\" (the divergence) inside the volume, including any singular points.\n\n5.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   **Surface `S`:** The surface enclosing the volume is the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Vector Field `f` on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, `r = R`, so the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element in vector form points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Set up the integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   First, compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂ ]`\n    *   Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   Now, integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    *   Integrate with respect to `θ` first:\n        `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Now, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫_{0}^{2π} 2 dφ = [2φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n    *   This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0` (i.e., the sphere encloses the singularity at the origin).\n\n9.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is `4π`.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
