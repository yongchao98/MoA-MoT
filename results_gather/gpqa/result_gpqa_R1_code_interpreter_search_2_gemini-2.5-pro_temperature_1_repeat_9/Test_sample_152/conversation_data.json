    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-hydrogens (on the CH₂ group) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic and will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n        *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C bond shift to form a new enolate intermediate: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Naming the product:** This compound is a tricarboxylic acid ester. We can name it systematically using IUPAC rules for polycarboxylic acids. The parent alkane chain to which the carboxyl groups are attached is a propane chain (`C-C-C`).\n        *   Chain: `C(1)H(COOCH₃)₂ - C(2)H(p-tolyl) - C(3)H₂(COOCH₃)`\n        *   The three ester groups (tricarboxylate) are at positions 1, 1, and 3 of the propane chain.\n        *   The p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n        *   The esters are all methyl esters (trimethyl).\n        *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophile at its α-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring). This is part of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-C≡N`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which acts as the Michael acceptor at the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate containing an iminium ion (on the cyclohexane ring) and an anion (on the nitrile part).\n    *   This intermediate is neutralized and then subjected to acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   The acidic workup hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The enamine was formed from cyclohexanone, so it will revert to cyclohexanone.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is the remnant of the but-2-enenitrile acceptor: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   So the structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   **Naming the product:** We name it as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`). The substituent is on C3. The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C2 position, so it is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product over the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (C, the Michael donor).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n        *   The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is the ring system.\n        *   The substituent at position 2 is a `(3-oxobutyl)` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   In the product, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group comes from the MVK acceptor. The bond connecting this group to the ring is at the β-position of the original MVK (`-CH₂-`).\n    *   This bond is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor must have provided the nucleophilic C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   The hydrogens at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic (pKa ~5) because they are between two carbonyl groups, and the resulting enolate is highly stabilized. The base `KOH` easily deprotonates this position to form the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
