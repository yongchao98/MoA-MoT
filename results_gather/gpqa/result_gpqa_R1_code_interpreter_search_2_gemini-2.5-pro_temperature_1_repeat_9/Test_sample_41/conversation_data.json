    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from the star and the energy it radiates as a black body. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $d$ is the orbital distance from the star.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $L$ is constant. The problem states that the albedo $A$ is the same for all three planets. $\\sigma$ is a universal constant. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{d^{1/2}}$\n\n    This means that the orbital distance $d$ is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    $d \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance $d$.\n    $P^2 \\propto d^3$\n\n    By taking the square root, we find the relationship for the period:\n    $P \\propto d^{3/2}$\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships to link Orbital Period and Equilibrium Temperature.**\n    Now we can substitute the relationship for $d$ from step 1 into the relationship for $P$ from step 2:\n    $P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^{3/2}$\n    $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^{(2 \\times 3/2)}}$\n    $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n    This crucial relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Note that the information about the planets' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratios.**\n    We want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3 / P_1$.\n    Using the proportionality from step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq3}^3}{1/T_{eq1}^3} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^3$\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    To find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$, we can multiply the two given ratios:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Now, substitute the value of $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$ back into the period ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3$\n\n    Let's compute the value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_over_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3\nTeq1_over_Teq3 = Teq1_over_Teq2 * Teq2_over_Teq3\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1 is related by (Teq1/Teq3)^3\nP3_over_P1 = math.pow(Teq1_over_Teq3, 3)\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio $P_3 / P_1$ is approximately 33.39.

    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$). To find this, we need to establish a relationship between orbital period ($P$) and equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is given by:\n$T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $L$ is the star's luminosity.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n*   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   $d$ is the orbital distance from the star.\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star, $L$ is constant.

Therefore, we can find a proportionality between temperature and distance:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\propto d^{-1/2}$\n\nThis implies that the orbital distance $d$ is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n$d \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance**\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. As the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance $d$.\n$P^2 \\propto d^3$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$P \\propto d^{3/2}$\n\nThe information about the planets' masses is irrelevant here because the mass of a planet is negligible compared to its star's mass in the context of Kepler's Third Law. The TTV method uses these masses, but for this specific calculation, they are not needed.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Relationships to Link Orbital Period and Temperature**\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship for distance from Step 1 into the relationship for the period from Step 2:\n$P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^{3/2}$\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n\nThis gives us the final relationship: the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratios**\n\nWe want to find the ratio $P_3/P_1$. Using the relationship from Step 3:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq3}^3}{1/T_{eq1}^3} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^3$\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n1.  $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n2.  $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$, we multiply the two given ratios:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Answer**\n\nNow, we can calculate the period ratio:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3$\n\nLet's perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1 is related to the ratio of equilibrium temperatures by P3/P1 = (Teq1/Teq3)^3.\n# First, we calculate the temperature ratio Teq1/Teq3.\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_over_Teq3 = 2.3\nTeq1_over_Teq3 = Teq1_over_Teq2 * Teq2_over_Teq3\n\n# Now, we calculate the period ratio P3/P1.\nP3_over_P1 = math.pow(Teq1_over_Teq3, 3)\n\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.39.

    "The problem requires us to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$). We can solve this by relating the orbital period to the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$) to Orbital Distance ($d$)**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n\nHere, $L$ is the luminosity of the star, $A$ is the planet's albedo, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $d$ is the orbital distance.\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star, $L$ is constant. The problem states that the albedo, $A$, is the same for all planets. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$, is a universal constant. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{d^{1/2}}$\n\nFrom this, we can express the orbital distance in terms of the equilibrium temperature:\n$d \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Period ($P$) to Orbital Distance ($d$)**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.

We substitute the expression for $d$ from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2:\n$P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^{3/2}$\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^{(2 \\times 3/2)}} = \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq3}^3}{1/T_{eq1}^3} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^3$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq3}$)**\n\nWe are given the following ratios:\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$, we can multiply the two given ratios:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio**\n\nNow we can calculate the final answer using the formula from Step 3 and the temperature ratio from Step 4.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nratio_T1_T2 = 1.4\nratio_T2_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3\nratio_T1_T3 = ratio_T1_T2 * ratio_T2_T3\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1 is the cube of the temperature ratio T1/T3\nperiod_ratio_P3_P1 = math.pow(ratio_T1_T3, 3)\n\nprint(period_ratio_P3_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital periods is approximately 33.39.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio $P_3/P_1$.\n\nThe solution involves a three-step process:\n1.  Find the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and its orbital distance ($d$).\n2.  Find the relationship between a planet's orbital period ($P$) and its orbital distance ($d$).\n3.  Combine these relationships to connect the orbital period directly to the equilibrium temperature and then calculate the required ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n\nIn this system:\n*   All planets orbit the same star, so the star's luminosity ($L$) is constant.\n*   The albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets (given as 0.3).\n*   The Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($\\sigma$) is a universal physical constant.\n\nTherefore, all terms except for the orbital distance ($d$) are constant for the three planets. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{d^{1/2}}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. We can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of temperature:\n$d \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n**Step 2: Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the orbits are given as circular, the semi-major axis is simply the orbital distance ($d$).\n$P^2 \\propto d^3$\n\nBy taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$P \\propto d^{3/2}$\n\n(Note: The planet masses provided in the problem are not needed for this step. Kepler's Third Law in this form assumes the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard approximation in such problems. The masses are likely included as distractors.)\n\n**Step 3: Combining Relationships and Calculating the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we can link the orbital period directly to the equilibrium temperature by substituting the expression for $d$ from Step 1 into the expression for $P$ from Step 2:\n$P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^{3/2}$\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^{(2 \\times 3/2)}} \\implies P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n\nThis crucial result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Using this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the periods of Planet3 and Planet1 as:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq3}^3}{1/T_{eq1}^3} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^3$\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nWe can find the ratio of the temperatures of Planet1 to Planet3 by multiplying these two ratios:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
