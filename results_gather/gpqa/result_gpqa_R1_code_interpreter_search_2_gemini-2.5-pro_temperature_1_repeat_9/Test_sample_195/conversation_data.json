    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a conservative force like the one given by Hooke's Law ($F=-kx$), the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved. The total mechanical energy ($E$) is the sum of the kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    $E = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define the potential and kinetic energy in the relativistic context.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy associated with the force $F = -kx$ is the same as in the classical case. It is calculated as the negative of the work done by the force from a reference point (usually the equilibrium position $x=0$) to a position $x$.\n        $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy (K):** In special relativity, the kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ is not $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Instead, it is given by:\n        $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Write the expression for the total conserved energy.**\n    The total conserved mechanical energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n    We can evaluate the total energy $E$ at two specific points and set them equal to each other.\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (turning point).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the position is $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E = (1 - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At the equilibrium position, the position is $x = 0$. Here, the potential energy is minimum (zero), and the kinetic energy, and thus the speed, is maximum. Let this maximum speed be $v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the energy at the turning point must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Now, square both sides of the equation:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
