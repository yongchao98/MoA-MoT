    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the nitration of toluene.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** The product, which we'll call **1**, is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** Product **1** (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an oxidation reaction. The reagent mixture MnO₂/H₂SO₄ is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the methyl group on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Possible Products:** An alkyl group on a benzene ring can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Under some conditions, MnO₂ can be used to stop the oxidation at the aldehyde stage (-CHO). Let's consider both possibilities for Product **2**.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Product **2** is p-nitrobenzoic acid. This involves complete oxidation.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Product **2** is p-nitrobenzaldehyde. This is a partial oxidation. In the context of multi-step synthesis problems, creating an aldehyde to set up a subsequent condensation reaction is a common pattern. This path is chemically very plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction and determine the structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product **2** is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   Let's analyze the outcome based on the two possibilities for Product **2**.\n\n*   **Following Possibility A (Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid):**\n    *   The reaction mixture contains p-nitrobenzoic acid, acetone, and NaOH.\n    *   The first reaction is an acid-base neutralization: p-nitrobenzoic acid + NaOH → sodium p-nitrobenzoate + H₂O.\n    *   The remaining NaOH acts as a base catalyst for the self-condensation of acetone (an aldol condensation). Acetone reacts with itself to form diacetone alcohol, which then dehydrates to form **mesityl oxide** ((CH₃)₂C=CHCOCH₃).\n    *   In this scenario, the sodium p-nitrobenzoate is merely a spectator. Product **3** would be mesityl oxide.\n\n*   **Following Possibility B (Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde):**\n    *   The reaction mixture contains p-nitrobenzaldehyde, acetone, and NaOH.\n    *   This is a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form an enolate nucleophile (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n    *   The enolate attacks the aldehyde carbonyl group. The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates because the new double bond is conjugated with both the aromatic ring and the ketone.\n    *   The final product **3** is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one** (`p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-COCH₃`).\n    *   This pathway is more likely the intended one as it involves a direct reaction with Product **2**, rather than having it be a spectator.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nNow, we determine the point group for the likely structure of Product 3. Both possibilities lead to the same result.\n\n*   **Symmetry of Mesityl Oxide ((CH₃)₂C=CHCOCH₃):**\n    *   The C=C-C=O backbone of the molecule is planar.\n    *   This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   There are no other symmetry elements (no rotational axes other than C₁, no center of inversion).\n    *   A molecule with only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n*   **Symmetry of 4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one:**\n    *   The most stable isomer is the E-isomer, where the large p-nitrophenyl group and the acetyl group are trans across the C=C double bond.\n    *   The entire conjugated system (`p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`) prefers a planar conformation to maximize orbital overlap.\n    *   Assuming this planar conformation, the plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    *   There is no rotational axis (like C₂) because the two ends of the molecule are different (a p-nitrophenyl group vs. a methyl group). There is no center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule also has only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). It belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth plausible reaction pathways yield a final product (Product 3) that belongs to the **Cₛ** molecular symmetry group. The options are A) D₂h, B) Cₛ, C) C₂h, D) C₃. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
