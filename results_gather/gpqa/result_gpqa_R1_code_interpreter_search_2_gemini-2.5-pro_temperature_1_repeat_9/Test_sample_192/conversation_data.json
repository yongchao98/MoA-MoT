    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given the relationship for the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`):\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    where `N` is the number of stars, `plx` is the parallax, and `r` is the distance.\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** The core physical principle connecting parallax and distance is their inverse relationship. Parallax is defined such that:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, but the units don't affect the proportionality).\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:** We need to convert the derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`) into a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`). The chain rule of calculus is the tool for this. When dealing with number densities or probability distributions, the transformation involves the absolute value of the derivative of the variable change (the Jacobian determinant in one dimension).\n\n    The relationship between the number density in terms of distance, `n(r) = dN/dr`, and the number density in terms of parallax, `n(plx) = dN/d(plx)`, is:\n    `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n        We have `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n        Using the power rule for differentiation:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step b: Find the absolute value of the derivative**\n        The absolute value is needed because the number of stars in a given shell of distance `dr` must be a positive quantity.\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step c: Express the original density `n(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n        We are given `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\n        Substitute `plx = 1/r`:\n        `n(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Step d: Combine the results using the transformation formula**\n        `dN/dr = n(r) ∝ n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n        Substitute the expressions from steps b and c:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step e: Simplify the expression**\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    A) ~ r^5\n    B) ~ r^3\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^2\n\n    The calculated proportionality `~ r³` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
