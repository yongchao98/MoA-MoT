    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In the context of the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals. We are told there are two particularly complex and informative signals:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these multiplicities mean according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **dtq:** A proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which gives a **doublet**.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), which gives a **quartet**.\n*   **dtt:** A proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which gives a **doublet**.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which gives another **triplet**.\n\nOur goal is to find which of the four proposed structures has protons in environments that would produce both of these specific splitting patterns.\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\nWe need to interpret the condensed formulas and determine the correct IUPAC name and structure for each option. Then, we can predict the splitting patterns for the protons in each structure.\n\n**A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n*   Analysis shows protons with multiplicities like `dt` (doublet of triplets) and `ddt` (doublet of doublets of triplets), but not the required `dtq` and `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n*   Analysis of the methine proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3`) shows it is coupled to the H at C2 (1H), the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H), and the CH3 of its own branch (3H). This would give a `dtq`. However, this structure lacks a proton that would give a `dtt` pattern.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n*   Analysis shows patterns like `tdq` (triplet of doublets of quartets) and `ds` (doublet of septets), which do not match the given data.\n\n**D) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\nLet's determine the structure and IUPAC name for this formula. The most systematic way to interpret this is as a chain of the listed groups: `CH3` - `CH(C2H5)` - `CH(C2H5)` - `CH2COOH`.\nTo find the IUPAC name, we must identify the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group (COOH).\n```\n         CH2CH3 (from the first C2H5 group)\n         |\n  CH3 - CH(c) - CH(b) - CH2(a) - COOH\n              |\n              CH2CH3 (from the second C2H5 group)\n```\nThe longest chain containing the COOH group goes from the carboxyl carbon, through C(a), C(b), C(c), and into the ethyl group attached to C(c). This is a 6-carbon chain, so it is a **hexanoic acid**.\n*   Numbering from the COOH carbon as C1:\n    *   C1: COOH\n    *   C2: CH2(a)\n    *   C3: CH(b)\n    *   C4: CH(c)\n    *   C5 and C6 are the carbons of the ethyl group attached to C4.\n*   Now identify the substituents on this hexanoic acid chain:\n    *   At C3, there is an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n    *   At C4, there is a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n```\n         CH3 (g)\n         |\n(f)CH3-(e)CH2--CH(c)--CH(b)--CH2(a)--COOH\n                   |\n                   CH2(d)--CH3\n```\n*   **Proton H(c) at C4:** This proton (`-CH(c)(CH3)-`) is coupled to:\n    *   The proton H(b) on C3 (1 neighbor) -> **doublet**\n    *   The two protons of the CH2(e) group on C5 (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl branch CH3(g) (3 neighbors) -> **quartet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton (`-CH(b)(C2H5)-`) is coupled to:\n    *   The proton H(c) on C4 (1 neighbor) -> **doublet**\n    *   The two protons of the CH2(a) group on C2 (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**\n    *   The two protons of the CH2(d) group on its ethyl branch (2 neighbors) -> **triplet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nStructure D, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound among the choices that has protons which would produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
