    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond (CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. When a trans-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, and then a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (an SN2-like mechanism). This results in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the carbon-carbon bond that was originally part of the epoxide.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** The overall transformation from the alkene to the diol is an *anti*-dihydroxylation. There is a general rule in stereochemistry for addition reactions on symmetrical alkenes:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**. This compound has two chiral centers (C4 and C5), but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry (in certain conformations) or a center of inversion. Specifically, it is a mixture of (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which are identical meso compounds.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:** We apply the stereochemistry rule for a cis-alkene:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (let's call it **R**) and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (let's call it **S**).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow, let's consider the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   **R** and **S** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a stereoisomer of both **R** and **S**, but it is not a mirror image. Therefore, **M** is a **diastereomer** of **R**, and **M** is also a **diastereomer** of **S**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed on two types of HPLC columns, assuming perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like **R** and **S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like **M** vs. **R**, and **M** vs. **S**) have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   So, the mixture will show one peak for the co-eluting enantiomers (**R+S**) and a second, separate peak for the meso diastereomer (**M**).\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like **R** and **S**) will have different retention times on a chiral column and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **diastereomer** (**M**) will also have a different retention time from both **R** and **S**.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique compounds in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3** (one for **R**, one for **S**, and one for **M**).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
