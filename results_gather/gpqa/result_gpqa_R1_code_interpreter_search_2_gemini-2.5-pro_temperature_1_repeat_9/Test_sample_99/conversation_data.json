    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the compounds and evaluate the statements:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and B**\n*   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula can represent either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a characteristic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Alkenes readily undergo electrophilic addition with Br2/CCl4, while cyclopropane does not react under these mild conditions.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is propene**.\n*   Propene reacts with bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene) + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   So, **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound C**\n*   **Compound B** (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (alc. KOH).\n*   Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation (removal of HX). Since B is a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it will undergo double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne.\n    CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 alc. KOH → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   So, **Compound C is propyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D**\n*   **Compound C** (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube.\n*   This is a classic reaction for the cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes to form aromatic compounds. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize.\n*   To minimize steric hindrance between the methyl groups, they will arrange themselves symmetrically on the resulting benzene ring.\n    3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n*   So, **Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound E**\n*   **Compound D** (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid, HNO3, and concentrated sulfuric acid, H2SO4).\n*   This reaction is the electrophilic nitration of the benzene ring. The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating and ortho-, para-directing group. In mesitylene, the positions 2, 4, and 6 are all activated and equivalent.\n*   Mesitylene + conc. HNO3 / conc. H2SO4 → 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (or 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene)\n*   So, **Compound E is 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound F**\n*   **Compound E** (2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl).\n*   This is a standard method (Bechamp reduction) for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n*   2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)\n*   So, **Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound G**\n*   **Compound F** (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), an aromatic primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   This reaction is diazotization, which converts the primary amino group into a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\n*   2,4,6-trimethylaniline + HNO2 → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n*   So, **Compound G is the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound H**\n*   **Compound G** (2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   When a diazonium salt solution is warmed, it hydrolyzes to form a phenol. The presence of a base like NaOH can facilitate this reaction.\n*   2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt --(H2O/NaOH, warm)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)\n*   So, **Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\n**Evaluation of the Statements:**\n\n**A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n*   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to its high symmetry, all three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and all three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. This results in two signals. Since there are no adjacent non-equivalent protons for splitting, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) C is a flammable gas.**\n*   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon alkyne, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n*   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) are fundamental starting materials in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (like in the formation of G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds to create dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n*   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored [Fe(OAr)6]3- complex. However, this test does not work for highly sterically hindered phenols because the bulky groups prevent the formation of the complex. The phenolic -OH group in H is flanked by two ortho-methyl groups, causing significant steric hindrance. Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test (i.e., no characteristic color change occurs). While the resulting solution might be yellow due to the color of the aqueous FeCl3 reagent itself, the statement implies a positive reaction, which is false. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
