    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1.  Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure Core:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" tells us we have a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. The formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n*   **Total Atom Count:** \"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\". Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   \"presence of a carbonyl group\" indicates a C=O double bond.\n    *   \"presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\" indicates a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2.  Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a C6H4 ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and stable arrangement for two carbons and a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   Let's check if this fits: The acetyl group has 2 carbons and one carbonyl. The halogen has 0 carbons. Total carbons in substituents = 2 + 0 = 2. This matches our requirement.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n**3.  Determine the Substitution Pattern using 1H NMR:**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly sensitive to the symmetry of the molecule and can distinguish between these isomers. The ring has 4 protons.\n\n*   **Ortho-isomer:** Would show a complex pattern, likely with 4 distinct signals for the 4 aromatic protons.\n*   **Meta-isomer:** Would also likely show 4 distinct signals for the 4 aromatic protons.\n*   **Para-isomer:** Due to the plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents, the ring protons exist as two equivalent pairs. This results in a much simpler spectrum: two signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2 protons.\n\n**4.  Analyze the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 7.8 ppm (2H, doublet) and 7.6 ppm (2H, doublet) represent the 4 aromatic protons. This pattern of two doublets for two protons each is the classic signature of a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The signal at 2.3 ppm (3H, singlet) is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that has no adjacent protons. This perfectly matches the methyl group in the acetyl (-COCH3) substituent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (~6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons on the ring. This spectrum only shows one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. Our derived structure is a ketone. Furthermore, if the compound were a halobenzaldehyde (X-C6H4-CHO), it would only have 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only structure that satisfies all the given conditions (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic ring, carbonyl group, aromatic-halogen bond) is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
