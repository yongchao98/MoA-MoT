    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for MFP is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Define λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual *gas molecules colliding with each other*. The moving particles and target particles are the same (gas molecules). The number density of targets is `n_gas`, and the collision cross-section is for a gas-gas collision, let's call it `σ_gg`. Due to the relative motion of the molecules, a correction factor of √2 is typically introduced in the denominator for collisions between identical particles.\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam colliding with the residual gas molecules*. The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are gas molecules. The number density of targets is the same, `n_gas`. The collision cross-section is for an electron-gas collision, let's call it `σ_eg`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n\n3.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:** To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\n    The relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relative sizes of the two collision cross-sections: the gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg) and the electron-gas cross-section (σ_eg).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic theory cross-section. It's determined by the physical size of the gas molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d`, the cross-section is σ_gg = πd². This represents a relatively large target area.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This describes the scattering of a high-energy (1000 kV) electron by a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, and an atom/molecule is mostly empty space. For a \"collision\" (i.e., significant scattering) to occur, the fast electron must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the atomic electrons. The probability of this happening is much lower than the probability of two bulky gas molecules \"bumping\" into each other. Therefore, the effective target area presented by a gas molecule to a high-energy electron is much smaller than the target area it presents to another gas molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg).\n        σ_eg << σ_gg\n\n5.  **Determine the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We established the ratio: λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, the ratio σ_gg / σ_eg is a large number (>> 1).\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 will be a number significantly greater than √2 (which is approx 1.414).\n    *   This leads to the definitive conclusion that **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply the electron's MFP is shorter, meaning it collides more often, which is contrary to the physics.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect. A difference is expected, and Mike's observation is physically sound.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Since we have robustly established that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (and certainly larger than 1.414 * λ1 based on simple models), it will definitely be greater than 1.22 * λ1.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. It places an upper bound on λ2 that is too low. Even the simplest kinetic theory model (which underestimates the effect) predicts λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, which already violates this condition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
