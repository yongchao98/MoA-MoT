    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a product named \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\", differing only in stereochemistry ((R) or (S)).\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   **\"pyran\"**: Indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **\"-2-one\"**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. By convention, the oxygen in the ring is position 1.\n*   **\"tetrahydro-\"**: Indicates the ring is saturated.\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The C4 carbon is a chiral center because it's attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, a -CH₂-C(=O)- group, and a -CH₂-CH₂-O- group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product of reaction 1 has the (R) configuration at C4, and the product of reaction 2 has the (S) configuration at C4.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      Et\n      |\nO(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H₂-C(4)H-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₂\n```\n\nThis is a δ-lactone, which is typically formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nAll options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has a five-carbon backbone.\n*   **\"pentanoic acid\"**: Implies a primary functional group of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **\"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\"**: This describes the substituent at the other end of the chain (C5). It is an isobutyl ester group: -C(=O)O-iBu.\n*   **\"3-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The C3 carbon is a chiral center, and it corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone product.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n                                Et\n                                |\n(isobutyl)-O-C(=O)-C(5)H₂-C(4)H₂-C(3)H-C(2)H₂-C(1)OOH\n```\nThis compound has two different reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a reducing agent that is more reactive than NaBH₄ but less reactive than LiAlH₄. Crucially, **LiBH₄ reduces esters much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids**. It will selectively reduce the ester group in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent (often used as BH₃·THF) has a strong preference for reducing carboxylic acids. In fact, **BH₃ reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters**. It is the standard reagent for selectively reducing a carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n\n### **4. Trace the Reaction Pathways**\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left untouched.\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --LiBH₄-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    ```\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the C1 and C5 positions of the starting material's main chain. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is left untouched.\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --BH₃-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    ```\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The internal hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the C1 and C5 functional groups. The chiral center at C3 is not involved. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
