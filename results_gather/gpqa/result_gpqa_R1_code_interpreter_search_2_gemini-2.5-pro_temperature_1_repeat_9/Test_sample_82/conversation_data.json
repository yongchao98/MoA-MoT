    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution:**\n    *   Initial volume of acid = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of the solution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   The number of moles of acid remains the same (0.001 moles).\n    *   New Concentration (M₂) = Moles / Final Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Understand 25% titration:** This is the point in the titration where 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n\n2.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** At this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻), which forms a buffer. The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where:\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n4.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75 or 1:3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is the same.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.48)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the volume of NaOH needed:** At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH3COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = 0.001 moles\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n2.  **Identify the species present:** At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COO⁻Na⁺). The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH3COO⁻] = Initial moles of acid / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n4.  **Set up the hydrolysis reaction and calculate Kb:**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   The equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH3COOH].\n    *   Kb = x² / ([CH3COO⁻] - x). We can approximate [CH3COO⁻] - x ≈ [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 M.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a python script for the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Initial conditions after dilution\ndiluted_acid_vol_L = 0.040\ndiluted_acid_conc_M = 0.025\n\n# Initial moles of acid\ninitial_moles_acid = diluted_acid_conc_M * diluted_acid_vol_L\n\n# Titrant\nnaoh_conc_M = 0.1\n\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point\nvol_naoh_eq_L = initial_moles_acid / naoh_conc_M\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = diluted_acid_vol_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate_M = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Set up the hydrolysis equilibrium: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate_M) where x = [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_M)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

    "This is a two-part problem involving the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH). We need to calculate the pH at two different points in the titration: at 25% completion and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles HA.\n*   New volume after dilution:\n    *   Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\nSo, the titration starts with 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This means the solution contains 75% unreacted acetic acid (HA) and 25% acetate (A⁻). This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base is a buffer solution.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At this point, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3. Since they are in the same solution, the ratio of concentrations is the same.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    *   Moles of HA = 0.001 mol (from Step 1).\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Determine the total volume and the species in solution:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   The solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻]:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution:**\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the relation Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]\n        Let x = [OH⁻] = [HA].\n        5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
