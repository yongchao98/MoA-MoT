    "This problem requires a comparison between the energy of paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) and the energy of a specific electronic transition in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian:\n$H_Z = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}$\nwhere $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$H_Z = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian is $H_Z = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} L_z$.\n\nThe energy associated with this interaction, which we'll call $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ as per the problem's notation, is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\nTherefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a small integer (e.g., $m=1$, since for $m=0$ the shift is zero). We will use $m=1$ to calculate the order of magnitude.\n*   The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\nCalculating the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is on the order of $10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon ($\\Delta E$) is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nA convenient formula for converting wavelength in nanometers to energy in electron-volts (eV) is:\n$\\Delta E \\, (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda \\, (\\text{nm})}$\n\nCalculating the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the transition energy is on the order of a few eV. (Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from $n=4$ to $n=2$ in the hydrogen atom).\n\n#### **Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n#### **Step 4: Use Python for precise calculation**\nTo verify the manual calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_eV_T = const.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = const.c\n# Planck constant in J*s\nh = const.h\n# Elementary charge in C (for J to eV conversion)\ne = const.e\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n# Orbital magnetic quantum number (small, non-zero)\nm = 1\n# Wavelength in meters\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. Paramagnetic coupling energy in eV\nH_para_eV = m * mu_B_eV_T * B\n\n# 2. Transition energy in Joules\ndelta_E_J = (h * c) / lambda_m\n# Convert transition energy to eV\ndelta_E_eV = delta_E_J / e\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_para_eV:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {delta_E_eV:.4e} eV\")\nratio = H_para_eV / delta_E_eV\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {ratio:.4e}\")\n\nif ratio < 0.01:\n    comparison = \"<H> << Delta E\"\nelse:\n    comparison = \"Other\" # This case is not expected\nprint(f\"Conclusion: {comparison}\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.7884e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta E = 2.5507e+00 eV\nRatio <H> / Delta E = 2.2694e-05\nConclusion: <H> << Delta E\n```\nThe calculation confirms that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ is approximately $5.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV, while $\\Delta E$ is about $2.55$ eV. The ratio is on the order of $10^{-5}$, confirming that the paramagnetic energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\approx 10^{-5}$ eV) is much smaller than the electronic transition energy ($\\approx 2.5$ eV). Therefore, the correct relationship is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe energy associated with the paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman effect) for the orbital angular momentum is given by the Hamiltonian $H_Z = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$. The energy shift, which we denote as $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is given by its expectation value.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.\nThe Hamiltonian becomes $H_Z = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n\nGiven that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, we have $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The interaction term simplifies to:\n$H_Z = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the energy shifts:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = E_Z = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} \\langle L_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\nwhere $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n*   $m$ has small integer values. For a non-zero effect, we can take $m=1$.\n*   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude for the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-5}$ eV.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon ($\\Delta E$) is related to its wavelength ($\\lambda$) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nWe can use the convenient formula that relates energy in electron-volts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm):\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nPlugging in the value of the wavelength:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude for the transition energy is approximately $1$ eV.\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level in the hydrogen atom).\n\n### **3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nWe now compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's look at the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small, the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the electronic transition energy. This relationship is written as:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThe Python code output confirms this calculation with high precision, showing that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than $\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
