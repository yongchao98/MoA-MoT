    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 moles\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely in water: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 moles\n    *   Therefore, moles of H+ = 0.08 moles\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely in water: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, the moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles\n\n**2. Identify the neutralization reactions.**\n\nWhen mixed, the strong base (OH-) will first neutralize the strong acid (H+), and then it will neutralize the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acidic species:**\n    *   Moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 moles\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 moles\n    *   Total acid equivalents = 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 moles\n\n*   **Total moles of basic species:**\n    *   Moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 moles\n\nSince the moles of base (0.18) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.13), the final solution will be basic.\n\n**3. Calculate the moles of excess hydroxide ions (OH-).**\n\nThe 0.18 moles of OH- will react with all the available acid.\n*   Moles of excess OH- = (Total moles of OH-) - (Total moles of acid)\n*   Moles of excess OH- = 0.18 moles - (0.08 moles + 0.05 moles)\n*   Moles of excess OH- = 0.18 moles - 0.13 moles = 0.05 moles\n\nAfter the neutralization reactions, 0.05 moles of OH- remain in the solution.\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.**\n\nFirst, determine the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH-. The presence of the strong base (excess OH-) will dominate the pH, so we can neglect the small amount of OH- produced by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO-).\n*   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**5. Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n\n*   **pOH:** The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH:** The pH and pOH are related by the equation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_plus_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_minus_from_baoh2 = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)\n\n# Moles of excess OH- after neutralization\nmoles_oh_minus_excess = moles_oh_minus_from_baoh2 - (moles_h_plus_from_hcl + moles_ch3cooh)\n\n# Total volume of the solution\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # in Liters\n\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconcentration_oh_minus = moles_oh_minus_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npoh = -math.log10(concentration_oh_minus)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"The final pH is: {ph:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
