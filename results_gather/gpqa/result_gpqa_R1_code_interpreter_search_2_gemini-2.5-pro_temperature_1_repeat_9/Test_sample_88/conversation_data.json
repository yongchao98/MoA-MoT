    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to deduce the class of compounds for Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n1.  The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n2.  **Reaction 1**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C to form Product 1. The spectral data for Product 1 includes an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. The provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 is unusual and does not match simple adamantane derivatives. We will hold this information for now. So, **Product 1 is a ketone**.\n3.  **Reaction 2**: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form Product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃, is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols.\n4.  **Reaction 3**: Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The fact that this reaction occurs means that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond, i.e., it is an alkene**.\n5.  **Connecting the steps**: If Product 1 is a ketone and Product 2 is an alkene, the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide must be more than just a simple MPV reduction. Given that the reaction is heated, a plausible sequence is an MPV reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, followed by a Lewis acid-catalyzed (Al(O-i-Pr)₃ can act as a Lewis acid) dehydration of the alcohol to form the alkene.\n    *   Product 1 (Ketone) ---[Al(O-i-Pr)₃, Heat]--> Intermediate Alcohol ---[Dehydration]--> Product 2 (Alkene)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 1 and Product 2.**\n\n1.  The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases at high temperatures is a known process that causes a skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage to the protoadamantane cage. The likely product is a ketone, specifically **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). While the provided NMR data for Product 1 is inconsistent with this structure (it may be a red herring or erroneous), this structure is the most chemically sound outcome of the first reaction.\n2.  **Product 1 = Protoadamantan-4-one**.\n3.  Product 1 is then reduced to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol, which subsequently dehydrates. Dehydration of this secondary alcohol involves removing a proton from an adjacent carbon. Elimination towards the bridgehead carbon (C3) is forbidden by Bredt's rule. Elimination must occur towards the methylene carbon (C5), resulting in a double bond between C4 and C5.\n4.  **Product 2 = Protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This alkene can undergo ozonolysis.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n1.  Product 3 is formed by the ozonolysis of Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n2.  Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 double bond. The carbon atoms of the double bond are converted into carbonyl groups. In protoadamant-4-ene, C4 is a tertiary carbon (part of a CH group in the alcohol intermediate) and C5 is part of a CH group in the alkene. The cleavage results in the opening of one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n3.  The product formed is a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde**. The C4 of protoadamantene becomes the ketone at position 3 of the new ring system, and C5 becomes the aldehyde at position 7.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n1.  **Structure of Product 3**: Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. In its preferred chair-chair conformation, it possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C3 ketone, the C9 methylene bridge, and the C7 carbon bearing the aldehyde group.\n2.  **Identify the most deshielded proton**: The question asks to exclude protons that exchange with deuterated solvent, which refers to the aldehydic proton (-CHO, δ ≈ 9-10 ppm). The remaining protons are on the carbon skeleton. The proton at C7 (H7) is alpha to the strongly electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. This will make it the most deshielded of the skeletal protons (typically δ ≈ 2.7-3.2 ppm), more so than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C2 and C4) or the bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5).\n3.  **Determine the coupling pattern of H7**: We need to identify the neighboring protons to H7.\n    *   H7 is on carbon C7. The adjacent carbons are C6 and C8.\n    *   Both C6 and C8 are methylene groups (CH₂).\n    *   Due to the C₂ symmetry of the molecule, the CH₂ group at C6 is chemically equivalent to the CH₂ group at C8.\n    *   Within each CH₂ group (e.g., at C6), the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. Let's call them H_a and H_b.\n    *   So, H7 is coupled to four neighboring protons in total: H6_a, H6_b, H8_a, and H8_b.\n    *   Because of the symmetry, the coupling constant J(H7, H6_a) is equal to J(H7, H8_a). Let's call this J_A.\n    *   Similarly, the coupling constant J(H7, H6_b) is equal to J(H7, H8_b). Let's call this J_B.\n    *   In the rigid bicyclic system, the dihedral angles between H7 and H_a protons will be different from the angles between H7 and H_b protons. Therefore, J_A will be different from J_B (J_A ≠ J_B).\n    *   The splitting pattern arises from coupling to two equivalent protons with J_A, and two other equivalent protons with J_B.\n    *   Coupling to the two protons with J_A splits the H7 signal into a triplet (intensity 1:2:1).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two protons with J_B into another triplet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
