    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Point Group\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 principal axis of rotation**: Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  A **σh horizontal mirror plane**: A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The C3h point group does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the 3D structure and symmetry elements of each option.\n\n**A) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** A cage-like bicyclic amine. It has a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, an axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. A 120° rotation about this axis interchanges the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   **σh plane:** No. A plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to cut through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. Since these bridges are puckered (like in a chair conformation), reflecting through this plane does not map the molecule onto itself.\n    *   **Other elements:** The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** Quinuclidine's point group is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The BO3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, an axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. In a propeller-like conformation, a 120° rotation interchanges the three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **σh plane:** No. The BO3 atoms lie in a plane, but the isopropyl groups do not. The hydrogen and two methyl groups attached to the central carbon of each isopropyl group are located above and below this plane due to the sp3 hybridization of that carbon. Reflection through the BO3 plane would not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate's most symmetric conformation belongs to the **C3** point group, not C3h.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic anhydride)**\n*   **Structure:** This is the trianhydride of mellitic acid. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings (-C(=O)O-C(=O)-) fused to adjacent pairs of carbons (1-2, 3-4, 5-6). The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, an axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation interchanges the three identical anhydride rings.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes, since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane, as it is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Perpendicular C2 axes:** No. If you try to place a C2 axis in the plane of the molecule passing through its center, it will not map the molecule onto itself. For instance, an axis passing through two opposite C-C bonds of the central ring would have an anhydride ring on one side and a simple bond on the other.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but no perpendicular C2 axes. Its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a symmetric trianhydride of triphenylene. It has a planar triphenylene core with three anhydride rings fused to its three equivalent outer sides. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, an axis passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   **Perpendicular C2 axes:** Yes. Unlike mellitic anhydride, this larger, more symmetric structure has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane and passing through the center. Each C2 axis bisects an anhydride ring and the bond opposite to it.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because this molecule has a C3 axis, a σh plane, *and* three perpendicular C2 axes, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. This typically means identifying the molecule whose complete set of symmetry operations corresponds to the C3h point group.\n*   Molecule A is C3v.\n*   Molecule C is C3.\n*   Molecule B is **C3h**.\n*   Molecule D is D3h.\n\nWhile a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, its symmetry is higher. In chemical context, a molecule is assigned to the highest symmetry point group that describes it. Therefore, the molecule that is correctly and completely described by the C3h point group is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
