    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\nThe user wants me to identify two compounds from given pairs based on specific chemical properties.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (which does not show tautomerism)**\n\nThe choice is between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (tautomers) that are readily interconvertible. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (the α-carbon) to the carbonyl oxygen. For this to happen, the molecule must possess at least one **α-hydrogen**.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H4O2.\n    *   α-Carbons: The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   α-Hydrogens: Let's examine these α-carbons. They are all part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). They have used all their four valence electrons to bond with other carbons (one single bond, one double bond, and one bond to the carbonyl carbon). There are no hydrogen atoms attached to these α-carbons.\n    *   Conclusion: Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H6O3.\n    *   α-Carbons: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons because they are each adjacent to two carbonyl groups.\n    *   α-Hydrogens: Each of these α-carbons is a CH2 group, meaning each has two hydrogen atoms attached. These hydrogens are quite acidic because the negative charge that forms upon their removal can be stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple α-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, meaning the equilibrium heavily favors the enol tautomer.\n\n4.  **Result for Part 1:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (which will show optical isomerism)**\n\nThe choice is between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**.\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: The IUPAC name indicates a propanoate (3-carbon ester) with a methyl group as the ester alkyl group (-OCH3) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon 2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Chiral Center: Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Conclusion: Since C2 is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the methyl ester of this acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the -COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Chiral Center: There are no sp3 hybridized carbons bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp2 hybridized as part of the double bond.\n    *   Chirality of the Molecule: The molecule has a center of inversion (an inversion point in the middle of the C=C bond). Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, it will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part 2:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   **A = benzoquinone**\n*   **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
