    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Identify the Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. The key idea behind these potentials is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential at a point `r` at time `t` depends on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** `tr`.\n\n### 2. Define the Variables and Geometry\n\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time (its trajectory).\n*   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the field point `r` at time `t`.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   `d`: The magnitude of this vector, i.e., the distance the signal traveled.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\n### 3. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. This must be equal to the time difference between the observation time `t` and the emission time `tr`.\n`t - tr = d / c`\nThis is the fundamental equation that defines the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a general time-varying charge density `ρ(r', t')` and current density `J(r', t')`, the retarded potentials are given by the integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere the `tr` in the integrand is `t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n### 5. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for `V(r, t)` gives:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(t - |r-r'|/c)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n### 6. Evaluating the Integral (The Liénard-Wiechert Derivation)\n\nEvaluating this integral is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The standard derivation (found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks like Griffiths or Jackson) shows that due to the motion of the source, the effective charge is modified by a Doppler-like factor.\n\nThe result of this integration is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nHere, all quantities in the square brackets (`d`, `d`, and `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The term `d ⋅ v` is the dot product of the vector `d` and the velocity `v`.\n\n### 7. Matching with the Given Options\n\nThe derived formulas are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - (d ⋅ v / c)))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v / c)))`\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator to match the form in the options:\n`d - (d ⋅ v / c) = (dc - d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential expressions:\nFor the scalar potential `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)) = (qc) / (4πε₀ * (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nFor the vector potential `A`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v / ((dc - d ⋅ v) / c)) = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π * (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 8. Final Comparison\n\nLet's compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = (qc) / (4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)), A(r,t) = (μ₀qc v) / (4π(dc - d⋅v))**\n    This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...**\n    This is the static Coulomb potential, incorrect for a moving charge as it ignores retardation and the velocity-dependent term in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...**\n    Same as B, the scalar potential is incorrect. The expression for A is also dimensionally wrong.\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = (qc) / (4πε₀(dc + d⋅v)), ...**\n    This has a `+` sign in the denominator. The correct sign is `-`. The negative sign indicates that if the charge is moving towards the observer (`d⋅v` is positive), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases, which is the correct physical effect (a form of Doppler effect).\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
