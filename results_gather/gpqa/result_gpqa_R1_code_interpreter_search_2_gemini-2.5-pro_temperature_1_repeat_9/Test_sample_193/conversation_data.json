    "The user wants to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3.\n\n1.  **Define the system:**\n    *   There are three spins: S1, S2, S3.\n    *   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\n    *   The total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the energy of the system:**\n    *   The energy `E` is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3].\n    *   Here, `J` is the coupling constant.\n\n3.  **Define the partition function:**\n    *   The partition function `Z` is the sum over all possible microstates `i` of the Boltzmann factor `exp(-β*E_i)`.\n    *   Z = Σ_i exp(-β*E_i), where β = 1/(kT).\n    *   Alternatively, if there are degenerate energy levels, Z = Σ_levels g(E) * exp(-β*E), where `g(E)` is the degeneracy of the energy level `E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy for each microstate:**\n    We need to list all 8 possible states (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy for each. Let's calculate the term `X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` first. The energy will then be `E = -J*X`.\n\n    *   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n        X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n        X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n        X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n        X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n        X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n        X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J(-1) = J\n\n    *   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -3J\n\n5.  **Group the states by energy level to find the degeneracies:**\n    *   **Energy Level 1:** E1 = -3J\n        This energy occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n    *   **Energy Level 2:** E2 = J\n        This energy occurs for the other 6 states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n        The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n6.  **Calculate the partition function Z:**\n    Z = g1 * exp(-β*E1) + g2 * exp(-β*E2)\n    Z = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * J)\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    This matches option (C).\n\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
