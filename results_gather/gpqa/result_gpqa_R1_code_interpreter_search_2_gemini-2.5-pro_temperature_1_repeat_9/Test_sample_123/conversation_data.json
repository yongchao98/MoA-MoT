    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The number of particles, `N`, remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is described by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation):**\n    The mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is dilated compared to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `T = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time it takes for them to reach the detector wall, `t_flight`, can be approximated as:\n    `t_flight ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    We can substitute the expressions for `T` and `t_flight` into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive the journey to the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall. Let's plug this into our combined equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ)`\n    ` -ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n    `ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)` (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Analyze the Final Condition:**\n    The question asks for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the wall. We set up a similar equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)` (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant value related to the detector and the particle type. We can find `γ₂` by setting up a ratio between Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\n    From Equation 1: `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n    From Equation 2: `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Since both expressions equal `(R/c) / τ`, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final number, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given initial Lorentz factor\ngamma1 = 20\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the natural logarithms\n# ln(3) is approx 1.0986\n# ln(3/2) or ln(1.5) is approx 0.4055\nratio = math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor\ngamma2 = gamma1 * ratio\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n54.1953931633355\n\nThe calculated value for `γ₂` is approximately 54.2.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) 40\n    B) 28\n    C) 54\n    D) 68\n\nThe calculated value of 54.2 is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor and the distance they travel. The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` from an initial number `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n\nwhere `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nDue to time dilation from special relativity, the lifetime in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`T_lab = γ * τ`\n\nThe particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the radius of the detector `R` is:\n\n`t ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation gives the fraction of surviving particles:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n-   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n-   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can solve for `γ₂`. The term `(R/c)/τ` is a constant because the detector radius and particle type are the same in both scenarios.\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can isolate this constant term:\n`(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nFrom Equation 2, we can also isolate it:\n`(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we set the two expressions equal to each other:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nFinally, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
