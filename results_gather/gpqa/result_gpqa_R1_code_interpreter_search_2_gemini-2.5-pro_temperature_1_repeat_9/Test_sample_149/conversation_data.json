    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO.\nFirst, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds present in the molecule.\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O).\n\nNow, let's analyze the 1H-NMR data:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH2 group).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton, which confirms it's next to the aldehyde proton (-CH2-CHO).\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2H is indicative of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\nLet's assemble the fragments:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring.\n2.  An amino group (-NH2) as one substituent.\n3.  An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO) as the other substituent.\n\nPutting these together gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal. Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\nThe starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O, Heat**\n    Treating a diazonium salt with water and heat results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The product from the previous step, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic α-protons (the protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the C=O group). It is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heated. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, it will undergo self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The α-proton (at C2) is removed, and the -OH group (at C3) is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final condensation product has a double bond between C2 and C3.\nInitial Aldol Addition Product:\n      OH\n      |\n(HOC6H4)-CH2-CH-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO\n\nFinal Condensation Product (after losing H2O):\n(HOC6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO\n\nThe systematic name for this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure. This is not a product of aldol condensation.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. The heat drives the reaction to the dehydrated product.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents. The final product should have hydroxyphenyl groups, not phenyl groups.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the correct structure and name for the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed via the aldol condensation reaction under heat.\n\n<<<D>>>"
