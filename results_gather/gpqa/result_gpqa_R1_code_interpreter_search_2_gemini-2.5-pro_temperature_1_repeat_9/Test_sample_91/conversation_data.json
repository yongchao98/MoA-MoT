    "This problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a given organic molecule using provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecule**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to determine its molecular formula and the types and numbers of chemical bonds it contains.\n\nThe molecule is given by the condensed formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's break down the structure and draw it to count the atoms and bonds:\nThe main carbon chain can be numbered as follows:\n`C1(=C2)-C3-C4(-C5)-C6(=C7)`\nLet's attach the substituent groups:\n-   **C1**: is bonded to two methyl (-CH3) groups.\n-   **C2**: is bonded to one hydrogen (-H) atom.\n-   **C3**: is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n-   **C4**: is bonded to one hydrogen (-H) atom and one methyl (-CH3) group.\n-   **C5**: is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n-   **C6**: is bonded to one hydrogen (-H) atom. (Wait, let me re-parse this. The formula is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`. Let's trace it again.)\n\nLet's trace the main chain from left to right:\n1.  `(CH3)2C=` : A carbon atom with two CH3 groups, double bonded to the next carbon.\n2.  `=CH-` : The next carbon, which has one H atom and is single bonded to the next part.\n3.  `-CH2-` : The next carbon, a methylene group.\n4.  `-CH(CH3)-` : The next carbon, with one H and one CH3 group.\n5.  `-CH2-` : The next carbon, a methylene group.\n6.  `-CH=` : The next carbon, with one H, double bonded to the final carbon.\n7.  `=C(CH3)2` : The final carbon, with two CH3 groups.\n\nThe structure is valid. Now, let's find the molecular formula and count the bonds.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C_x H_y):**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 7 in the main chain + 5 in the methyl groups = **12 Carbon atoms**.\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n        *   From CH groups in the chain: 1 (on C2) + 1 (on C4) + 1 (on C6) = 3 H\n        *   From CH2 groups in the chain: 2 (on C3) + 2 (on C5) = 4 H\n        *   From the 5 methyl (CH3) groups: 5 * 3 = 15 H\n        *   Total H atoms = 3 + 4 + 15 = **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. (C1=C2 and C6=C7). Count = **2**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:**\n        *   In the main chain: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. Count = 4.\n        *   Connecting methyl groups: 2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7. Count = 5.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms. Count = **22**.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThe total bond energy is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound, forming gaseous atoms. It is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (2 × 300) + (9 × 200) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 600 + 1800 + 8800\nΔH_atomization(compound) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n\nThe formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\n*   **For Carbon:** We need 12 moles of gaseous Carbon atoms from solid Carbon.\n    *   ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n    *   Energy for 12 moles of C = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen atoms from H2 gas.\n    *   The bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break 1 mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms (`H2 -> 2H`).\n    *   We need 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules.\n    *   Energy for 22 moles of H = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:**\n    *   ΣΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law:\n\nΔHf = [Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements] - [Total Bond Energy of Compound]\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Convert to Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This is not directly listed as an option in kJ/mol (Option C is 67.4 kJ/mol). Let's check the options with units of kJ/g by converting our result.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nH_atom_C = 1000      # Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon (kJ/mol)\nBE_HH = 100          # Bond energy of H-H (kJ/mol)\nBE_CC_single = 200   # Bond energy of C-C (kJ/mol)\nBE_CC_double = 300   # Bond energy of C=C (kJ/mol)\nBE_CH = 400          # Bond energy of C-H (kJ/mol)\n\n# 1.
