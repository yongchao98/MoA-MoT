    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine (Br) atom at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, and the amide ion (NH2⁻) is also a strong nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C6, which holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.**\n        *   The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   An anion is formed at C6. This anion then attacks C1 and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        *   This creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.**\n        *   The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than abstracting the proton from C6.\n        *   An anion is formed at C2. This anion then attacks C1 and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        *   This creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    *   Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ adds to C1, a negative charge develops at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ adds to C6, a negative charge develops at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. When we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is the standard non-deuterated benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at C1 or C2. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, both attacks lead to the same product after protonation.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2), with no deuterium.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   From the two possible reaction pathways, we have identified three chemically distinct organic products:\n        1.  **Aniline**\n        2.  **2-deuterioaniline**\n        3.  **3-deuterioaniline**\n\n    *   Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
