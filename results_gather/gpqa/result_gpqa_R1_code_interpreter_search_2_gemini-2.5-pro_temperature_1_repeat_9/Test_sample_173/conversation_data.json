    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial parameters and relationships:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: $E_M = M c^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive one, so $m_1 = 2 m_2$.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-masses and rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n*   We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1.  $m_1 = 2 m_2$\n    2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    $2 m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3 m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\n*   Now, find $m_1$:\n    $m_1 = 2 m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n*   We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \\times (M c^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \\times (M c^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Released):**\n*   The Q-value of the fission is the energy released, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies. This energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (T) of the fragments.\n*   $Q = T_{total} = (\\text{Initial rest-mass energy}) - (\\text{Final rest-mass energy})$\n*   $Q = M c^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   So, the total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum, $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   Therefore, $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33 M}{0.66 M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   So, $T_2 = 2 T_1$.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = Q \\implies T_1 + 2 T_1 = Q \\implies 3 T_1 = Q$.\n*   $T_{1, \\text{class}} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n*   Momentum is conserved, so $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The total energy is also $E = T + mc^2$, where T is the kinetic energy.\n*   From this, we can express momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n*   Since $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1 c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2 c^2)$.\n*   Substitute $T_2 = Q - T_1$:\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1 c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2 c^2)$\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1 c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2 c^2) - 2T_1(m_2 c^2)$\n*   Cancel $T_1^2$ and rearrange to solve for $T_1$:\n    $2T_1(m_1 c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2 c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2 c^2)$\n    $T_1 [2(m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2 c^2)$\n    $T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2 c^2)}{2(m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 + Q)}$\n*   Now, substitute the energy values (in GeV): $Q=3$, $m_1c^2=198$, $m_2c^2=99$.\n    $T_{1, \\text{rel}} = \\frac{3(3 + 2 \\times 99)}{2(198 + 99 + 3)} = \\frac{3(201)}{2(300)} = \\frac{603}{600} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   $T_{1, \\text{rel}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n*   Difference = (Correct T1 value) - (Classical T1 value)\n*   Difference = $T_{1, \\text{rel}} - T_{1, \\text{class}}$\n*   Difference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Initial values\nMc2 = 300  # in GeV\n\n# Calculate rest masses and energies of fragments\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using classical approximation\n# T1_class / T2_class = m2 / m1\n# T1_class + T2_class = Q\n# T1_class + T1_class * (m1/m2) = Q\n# T1_class * (1 + m1/m2) = Q\n# T1_class = Q / (1 + m1/m2)\nm1 = 0.66\nm2 = 0.33\nT1_class = Q / (1 + (m1/m2))\n\n# Calculate T1 using relativistic formula\n# T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2 + Q))\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2 + Q))\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\n# 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_rel - T1_class) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Q-value: {Q:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_class:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_rel:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\n<<<\nQ-value: 3.000 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n>>>\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value of T1 and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_M = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThe nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n2.  The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-masses of the fragments:\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments in terms of the initial rest-mass energy:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1 c^2 = 0.66 M c^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2 c^2 = 0.33 M c^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_{total} = T_1 + T_2$). The Q-value is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be $p$.\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, $T_2 = 2T_1$.\nUsing the total kinetic energy: $T_1 + T_2 = Q \\implies T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nTherefore, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n$T_{1, \\text{class}} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Case 2: Relativistic Calculation (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\nThe kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$, so $E = T + mc^2$.\nWe can express the momentum term as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\nSince the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\nWe know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\nCancel the $T_1^2$ terms and rearrange to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1[2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + Q)}$\nNow, plug in the energy values we found earlier: $Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$T_{1, \\text{rel}} = \\frac{3(3 + 2 \\times 99)}{2(198 + 99 + 3)} = \\frac{3(3 + 198)}{2(297 + 3)} = \\frac{3(201)}{2(300)} = \\frac{603}{600} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nTherefore, the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is:\n$T_{1, \\text{rel}} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{rel}} - T_{1, \\text{class}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
