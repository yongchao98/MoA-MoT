    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the simplest signal.**\n    The signal at 2.1 ppm is a singlet (s) and integrates to 3 protons (3H). A 3H singlet around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O). All four given options are acetates (containing a CH₃COO- group), so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the size of the alkyl chain.**\n    Let's sum the integrations for the other signals: 7.0 ppm (1H) + 5.5 ppm (1H) + 1.6 ppm (3H) = 5 protons.\n    This tells us that the part of the molecule attached to the acetate oxygen (the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part) has 5 protons.\n    *   A propenyl group (C₃H₅) has the formula CH₃-CH=CH-. It has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. This matches our data.\n    *   A butenyl group (C₄H₇) has a formula like CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-. It has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 protons. This does not match our data.\n    Therefore, we can eliminate the \"butenyl\" options. The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the signals from the propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-).**\n    We have three signals corresponding to the three distinct proton environments in this group.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group (CH₃-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This fits the CH₃-CH= structure.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinylic protons (a proton on the C=C double bond). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one other proton. Protons on a carbon attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=) are deshielded and appear far downfield, so this is likely the proton closest to the acetate group.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton. The doublet of quartets (dq) multiplicity confirms its position. The \"d\" comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton, and the \"q\" (quartet) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (n+1 rule: 3+1=4 lines).\n\n*   **Step 4: Distinguish between Cis and Trans isomers.**\n    The key to differentiating between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   For **trans** protons (on opposite sides of the double bond), the coupling constant is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For **cis** protons (on the same side of the double bond), the coupling constant is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    The data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm. This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound has an acetyl group, a propenyl group, and the double bond in the propenyl group has a trans geometry. The unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
