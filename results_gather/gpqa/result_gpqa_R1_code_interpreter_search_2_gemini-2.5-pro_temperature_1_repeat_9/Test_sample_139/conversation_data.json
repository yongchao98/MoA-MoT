    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decoding the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This immediately suggests a compound containing Deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of Hydrogen (H). Common lab reagents like this include deuterated reducing agents.\n\n*   **Clue 2 & 7: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y...\" and \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** The most common analogs would be Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated versions are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄. These metal hydrides react violently with water (H₂O), a likely candidate for liquid Y.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n    *   The reaction of a deuteride (like LiAlD₄) with a protic solvent (like H₂O) releases hydrogen gas. Since the source of the hydride is Deuterium, the gas released will be Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Let's check the proton and neutron count for a D₂ molecule:\n        *   A single Deuterium (D) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This perfectly matches the description of gas W. So, W = D₂.\n\n*   **Clue 4 & 5: \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   Let's consider the reaction of our candidates with water (Y=H₂O).\n    *   If X = LiAlD₄: LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is formed as a solid precipitate (G).\n    *   Heating this precipitate causes decomposition: 2Al(OH)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(g).\n    *   The substance released is B = H₂O (water).\n    *   The melting point of water is 0 °C, which is 273.15 K. The value 277 K (approx. 4 °C) is very close to this and might be a slight inaccuracy or a distractor referring to the temperature of water's maximum density. This scenario is highly plausible.\n    *   If X = NaBD₄: NaBD₄ + 2H₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g). The product, sodium metaborate (NaBO₂), is soluble in water, so no precipitate (G) would form. This makes LiAlD₄ a much stronger candidate.\n\n*   **Clue 6: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones (to alcohols) and carboxylic acids (to primary alcohols).\n    *   Let's take the simplest keto acid, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH). It has 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Reaction with LiAlD₄: CH₃-CO-COOH --(LiAlD₄)--> CH₃-CD(OH)-CD₂OH. The product is a diol (an alcohol with two -OH groups).\n    *   Counting the oxygen atoms in the product: There are two oxygen atoms. This matches the clue exactly.\n    *   Let's check NaBD₄ for completeness. NaBD₄ is a milder reducing agent and typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be CH₃-CD(OH)-COOH, which contains three oxygen atoms. This does not match the clue.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Substance X:** All clues converge to identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n*   **Identify the elements in X:** The formula is LiAlD₄. The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n*   **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements:** We need to compare their atomic masses. We'll use the integer masses of the specific isotopes present.\n    *   Deuterium (D): mass ≈ 2 amu\n    *   Lithium (Li): The most common isotope has a mass of 7 amu.\n    *   Aluminum (Al): The only stable isotope has a mass of 27 amu.\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass as requested:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present,\" considering all atoms of those elements.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Total Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
