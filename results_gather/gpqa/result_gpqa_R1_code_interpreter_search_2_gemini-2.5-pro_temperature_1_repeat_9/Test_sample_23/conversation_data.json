    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n*   14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Setting the mass fraction to 1/7: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n*   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂ and its molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula: n=6, m=12, which fits m=2n. Thus, it is highly probable that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's set **D = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C also gives Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   C + H₂ → Z (C₆H₁₂)\n*   Since C does not decolorize bromine water, it must either be a saturated compound or an aromatic one.\n    *   If C were a saturated compound that could be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it would have to be a strained polycyclic alkane with the same number of carbon atoms, for example, a bicyclo[x.y.z]hexane. The most stable such compound, bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane, has the formula C₆H₁₀.\n    *   Alternatively, if C were aromatic, it would be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under standard conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature and pressure with a catalyst).\n*   Let's evaluate these two possibilities for C in the next step. For now, we have two potential compositions for mixture Y:\n    *   Possibility 1: Y = {Bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (C₆H₁₀), Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)}\n    *   Possibility 2: Y = {Benzene (C₆H₆), Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)}\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X and resolve the possibilities for Y**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. They undergo disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form mixture Y. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction involves the components of X reacting to form the components of Y. Since the initial and final mixtures are equimolar, we can assume a 1:1 stoichiometry for the reactants and products.\n    *   A + B → C + D\n*   This implies that the total number of atoms must be conserved. Specifically, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total in one molecule of C and one of D.\n    *   H(A) + H(B) = H(C) + H(D)\n*   Let's test our two possibilities for Y:\n    *   **Possibility 1 (Y = C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₁₂):** H(C) + H(D) = 10 + 12 = 22. So, H(A) + H(B) = 22.\n    *   **Possibility 2 (Y = C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂):** H(C) + H(D) = 6 + 12 = 18. So, H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n*   Now let's consider the properties of A and B.\n    *   They both decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are C₆ compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   The maximum number of hydrogen atoms in such a molecule is 10 (for cyclohexene). Therefore, the maximum possible sum H(A) + H(B) is 10 + 10 = 20.\n*   This contradicts the result from Possibility 1 (H(A) + H(B) = 22). Therefore, Possibility 1 is incorrect.\n*   Possibility 2 requires H(A) + H(B) = 18. Let's see if we can achieve this with our candidate molecules. If we choose **A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**, the sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer**\n\n*   The components of mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n*   The reaction is:\n    C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n    This is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) reaction.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
