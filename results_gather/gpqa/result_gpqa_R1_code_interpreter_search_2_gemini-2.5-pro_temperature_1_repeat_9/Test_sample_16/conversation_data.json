    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves the equilibrium between the calcium-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻) and its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (EDTA⁴⁻). The formation reaction is:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f):** The formation constant, also called the stability constant, is given for this reaction. It expresses the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium.\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n    We are given K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰. A very large K_f value indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and the complex is very stable.\n\n3.  **Set up the dissociation scenario:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻. This complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n4.  **Use an ICE table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species         | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻     | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n    According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, for every mole of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of EDTA⁴⁻ are formed. Therefore, at equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.\n\n5.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:** Now, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying approximation:** Because the formation constant (K_f) is extremely large (5 x 10¹⁰), the dissociation of the complex will be very minimal. This means that the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    This result matches option A. The approximation (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M is much smaller than 0.02 M) is valid.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, a python script can be used:\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# This is a quadratic equation: K_f * x^2 + x - initial_complex_conc = 0\n# However, given the large K_f, we can use the approximation:\n# K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# So, x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution output:\n```\n6.32e-07\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻) is very stable, but it undergoes a slight dissociation into its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The equilibrium reaction for this dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which corresponds to the formation reaction (Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻).\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms at equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    From the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ will be equal at equilibrium ([Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x).\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant equation:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Simplification:** The formation constant (K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction, meaning very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n6.  **Solving for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearranging to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is represented by x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value matches option A. The Python code calculation in the previous step confirmed this result as 6.32e-07.\n\n<<<A>>>"
