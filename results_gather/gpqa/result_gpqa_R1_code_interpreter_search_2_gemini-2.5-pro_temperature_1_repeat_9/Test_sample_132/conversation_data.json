    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\nWe have a solution containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). When dissolved in water, these salts dissociate completely:\n*   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4-\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\n\nThe solution therefore contains a mixture of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4-), a weak acid, and its conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-). This constitutes a buffer solution. The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\n**2. Calculate the Molar Concentrations of the Buffer Components**\nFirst, we need to find the initial molar concentrations of the acid (H2PO4-) and the base (HPO4^2-).\n\n*   **Volume of solution:** V = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n*   **For KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4^2-):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is primarily controlled by the equilibrium between H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which is described by the second acid dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   **Ka2 expression:** Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n*   [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n*   [H+] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This equilibrium is described by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka3.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n*   **Ka3 expression:** Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-]:\n*   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n*   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M (from Step 2)\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M (from Step 3)\n\n*   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n*   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation can be verified using a single computational script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\npo4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
