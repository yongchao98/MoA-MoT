    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State**\n\n*   The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its initial momentum as zero and its initial energy as its rest mass energy.\n*   The proton is assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame, as is standard unless specified otherwise. Its momentum is zero.\n*   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($P_{initial} = 0$).\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. A proton and an antiproton have the same mass.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Energy**\n\n*   We need the rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$). This is a standard physical constant.\n<search>proton rest mass energy in MeV</search>\n<information>The proton rest mass is 938.27208816(29) MeV/c². So, its rest mass energy is approximately 938.3 MeV.</information>\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**3. Understand the Final State**\n\n*   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero ($P_{final} = P_{initial} = 0$).\n*   For the total momentum to be zero, the four resulting particles must move away from the point of annihilation. Due to symmetry and conservation of energy, we can conclude that all four particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same kinetic energy.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Energy**\n\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**5. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   $1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**6. Solve for the Velocity (v)**\n\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200}$\n\n*   Now, we solve for $\\beta = v/c$ using the relationship $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n\nLet's use a Python script for precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm_p_c2 = 938.3  # MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300    # MeV\n\n# Total initial energy\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Final energy is 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final  =>  2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated gamma is: {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity as a fraction of c (beta) is: {beta}\")\n```\n<execution_output>\nThe calculated gamma is: 1.5638333333333333\nThe calculated velocity as a fraction of c (beta) is: 0.7716186358510166\n</execution_output>\nThe calculated velocity is approximately $0.7716c$.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a particle annihilation problem, which is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves a particle-antiparticle annihilation resulting in the creation of new particles. The core principles governing this process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.

So, $P_{final} = 0$. This means the four created particles must move away from the point of annihilation in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Final Energy:** Due to the conservation of momentum and the symmetry of the products (two pairs of identical particles), all four resulting particles will have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same speed, $v$.
