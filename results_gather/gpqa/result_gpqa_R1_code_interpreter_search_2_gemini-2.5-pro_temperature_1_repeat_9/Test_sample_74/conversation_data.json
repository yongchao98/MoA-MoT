    "Eukaryotic protein translation is a complex process that starts with the ribosome recognizing a start codon (usually ATG, which codes for Methionine) and proceeds by reading codons (triplets of nucleotides) to assemble a polypeptide chain, amino acid by amino acid. This process continues until the ribosome encounters one of the three stop codons: TAA, TAG, or TGA. When a stop codon enters the A site of the ribosome, a release factor binds, leading to the hydrolysis of the bond between the polypeptide and the tRNA, releasing the newly synthesized protein and causing the dissociation of the ribosomal subunits.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence to see if it correctly encodes the intended fusion protein, which is an N-terminally HA-tagged GADD45G protein.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `5'ATG...`, which is the standard start codon. This is correct.\n\n2.  **Identify the HA Tag Sequence:** The standard DNA sequence for a single HA tag is `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT`. The protein sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Let's check the provided sequence:\n    *   Provided sequence: `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAA...`\n    *   The first codon is `ATG` (Start Methionine).\n    *   Following that is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, which translates to the amino acid sequence `Y P Y D V P D Y A`. This correctly encodes the HA tag. So, the tag itself is correct.\n\n3.  **Scan for In-frame Stop Codons:** After the start codon, the ribosome will read the sequence in a specific \"reading frame\" of three nucleotides at a time. We need to examine the sequence in this frame to see if there is a premature stop codon that would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early.\n    *   Start Codon: `ATG`\n    *   HA Tag: `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`\n    *   The very next codon in the sequence is `AAA` (Lysine).\n    *   The codon after that is `TGA`.\n\n    Let's look at the sequence in codons from the start:\n    `ATG (Met) TAC (Tyr) CCA (Pro) TAC (Tyr) GAT (Asp) GTT (Val) CCA (Pro) GAT (Asp) TAC (Tyr) GCC (Ala) AAA (Lys) TGA (STOP)`\n\n    The sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the sequence encoding the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine). `TGA` is one of the three canonical stop codons. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it will terminate translation. This means that instead of producing the full-length GADD45G fusion protein, the cell will only produce a very short peptide (Met-HA-Lys). This tiny, non-functional peptide would likely be unstable and quickly degraded, leading to the observation that the protein cannot be detected or overexpressed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers are often used to ensure proper folding between a tag and a protein, their absence does not automatically trigger proteolysis. The primary issue here is the failure to even synthesize the full-length protein.\n    *   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, in all eukaryotes, including mice and hamsters (CHO cells are hamster-derived).\n    *   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As analyzed in step 2, the DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct. There is a single nucleotide difference (`GCC` instead of the more common `GCT` for the final Alanine), but this is a silent mutation as both codons encode Alanine. It is not a missense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of a premature `TGA` stop codon right after the HA tag sequence is the clear reason for the failure to express the full-length protein. The ribosome terminates translation far too early.\n\n<<<B>>>"
