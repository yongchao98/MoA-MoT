    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis and the analysis of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid catalyst (which can be generated in situ), one of the α-hydrogens of cyclohexanone is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring with a C=O group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) reacts with a strong base to form a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the strained carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropanone ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, which is then protonated. This results in the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one carbon.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde):** This hydrogen lies on the plane of symmetry and is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These carbons are adjacent to C1. They are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the aldehyde group). The same is true for C5. Therefore, the \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the \"lower\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These carbons are beta to C1 and are also equivalent by symmetry. Like the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2/C5 protons: 2 sets\n*   C3/C4 protons: 2 sets\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
