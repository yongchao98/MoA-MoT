    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the phenyl ring are a bromo group (-Br) and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The numbering convention for substituted acetophenone gives the carbon attached to the acetyl group position 1. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5.\n*   This means the three substituents (-COCH3, -Br, -NO2) are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nThe fact that the final product has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern despite containing an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving the modification or temporary use of directing groups.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple Synthetic Routes**\n\nA simple, three-step route might be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone (-COCH3 is *m*-directing).\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 directs NO2 to the *meta* position).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-acetyl-3-nitro-5-bromobenzene (the target). In this step, both the -COCH3 and -NO2 groups are *meta*-directors, and they cooperatively direct the incoming Br+ to position 5.\n\nThis route is chemically logical. However, it is not one of the options. The options provided are all seven steps long, which implies that this simple route may have a drawback, such as a very low yield in the final bromination step due to the ring being strongly deactivated by two groups. We must therefore analyze the provided multi-step options.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nMany of the options include the sequence: **Fe/HCl** (reduction of a nitro group to an amine), followed by **NaNO2/HCl** (diazotization of the amine), and **H3PO2** (deamination, replacing the diazonium group with hydrogen). This is a powerful technique to use a nitro group as a temporary \"directing group\" and then remove it.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established reaction principles:\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These options propose a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a ring that already has a bromo and a nitro group (like bromonitrobenzene). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings such as these. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This option suggests a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on aniline (product of step ii). This reaction also fails because the basic amine (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing the desired acylation. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This leaves option A as the most likely candidate. Let's trace the reaction sequence step-by-step to see if it's chemically sound and leads to the target product in high yield.\n\n    **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone**\n    *   This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. It works well.\n\n    **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone**\n    *   The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination occurs at position 3. This step is correct.\n\n    **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration**\n    *   The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at pos 1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at pos 3). In case of conflicting directing effects between a halogen and a meta-directing deactivator, the *o,p*-director usually controls the position. The bromine directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* (pos 2, 4) and *para* (pos 6) positions. Substitution at position 4 is sterically accessible and electronically favored. Let's assume the major product formed (or the one isolated for the next step) is **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**. This nitro group will serve as our temporary directing group.\n\n    **iv) 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone**\n    *   The nitro group at position 4 is selectively reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\n    **v) 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration**\n    *   This is the key step. We are nitrating a ring with three substituents: -COCH3 (pos 1), -Br (pos 3), and -NH2 (pos 4). The amino group is a very strong activating *ortho, para*-director. Its directing effect will dominate.\n        *   The -NH2 group at pos 4 directs *ortho* to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is blocked. So, it strongly directs the new nitro group to **position 5**.\n        *   The -COCH3 group at pos 1 is a *meta*-director, and it also directs to **position 5**.\n    *   Since two groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5, this reaction should proceed in high yield to form **4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n\n    **vi) 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization**\n    *   The amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n\n    **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**\n    *   The deamination reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the temporary directing group that was introduced in step iii.\n\nThe final product is 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene, which is the target molecule. The entire sequence is chemically plausible and uses a clever strategy to ensure high regioselectivity (and thus high yield) at each critical step.\n\n<<<A>>>"
