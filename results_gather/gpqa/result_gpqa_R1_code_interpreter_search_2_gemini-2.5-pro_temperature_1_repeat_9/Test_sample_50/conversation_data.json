    "This problem requires us to calculate the potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. The most effective way to solve this problem is by using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Method of Images Setup:**\n    The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are identical to the field and potential that would be created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed. The condition is that the potential on the surface where the sphere was must be zero (since it's grounded).\n\n2.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the sphere have radius `R`.\n    *   The external charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), the image charge and its position must be:\n        *   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The sphere is maintained at zero potential throughout this process.\n\n    The work done (`W`) is the integral of the external force (`F_ext`) required to move the charge. The external force is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force (`F_e`) exerted by the induced charges on the sphere on the charge `q`.\n    `U = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dr = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_e ⋅ dr`\n\n    The electrostatic force `F_e` on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n\n    *   At a general position `x` for the charge `q`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'(x)` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force `F_e` on charge `q` at position `x` is:\n        `F_e(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\n        `F_e(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n        `F_e(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n        `F_e(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    Now, we integrate this force to find the work done, which is the potential energy `U`.\n\n    `U = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_e(x) dx`\n    `U = -∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du / 2`.\n\n    `∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ [1 / u^2] (du / 2) = (1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (-1 * u^(-1)) = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we apply the limits of integration:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0 ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Alternative Method (using Interaction Energy):**\n    For a system where a charge distribution is induced on a conductor by an external charge, the total potential energy is half the interaction energy between the external charge and the induced charges. In the image method, this is half the interaction energy of the external charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   Interaction energy of `q` and `q'`: `U_int = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `U_int = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The potential energy of the physical system (`q` + grounded sphere) is:\n        `U = (1/2) * U_int = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. Now we compare this result with the given options.\n    *   A) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\n    Our calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C. Note that `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
