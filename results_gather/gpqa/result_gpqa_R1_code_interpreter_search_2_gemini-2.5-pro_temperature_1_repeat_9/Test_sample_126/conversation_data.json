    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's draw its structure.\n        *   \"nona\" means a 9-carbon main chain.\n        *   \"2,6-diene\" means there are double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n        *   \"5-butyl\" means a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   To ensure the lowest possible locants for the double bonds (2 and 6), we number the chain from the end that gives this result.\n    *   The structure is:\n        `CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)`\n        where C₄H₉ is the butyl group.\n\n    *   **Reaction Condition:** The molecule is heated. Heating a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically the **Cope Rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Identify the 1,5-Diene System:**\n    The Cope rearrangement occurs on a hexa-1,5-diene subunit. In our molecule, this corresponds to the chain of atoms from C2 to C7:\n    `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`\n    This is the six-carbon system that will undergo the rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state where one sigma (σ) bond breaks and a new one forms, while two pi (π) bonds shift their positions.\n    *   **Bond breaking:** The σ-bond between C4 and C5 breaks.\n    *   **Bond formation:** A new σ-bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   **π-bond shift:** The π-bond between C2 and C3 moves to form a new π-bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   **π-bond shift:** The π-bond between C6 and C7 moves to form a new π-bond between C5 and C6.\n\n4.  **Trace the Atoms and Groups to Determine the Product Structure:**\n    Let's see what is attached to each of the six carbons in the rearranging system:\n    *   `C2`: is attached to a methyl group (C1) and a hydrogen.\n    *   `C3`: is attached to a hydrogen.\n    *   `C4`: is a CH₂ group (attached to two hydrogens).\n    *   `C5`: is attached to a hydrogen and a butyl group.\n    *   `C6`: is attached to a hydrogen.\n    *   `C7`: is attached to a hydrogen and an ethyl group (C8 and C9).\n\n    Now let's build the product based on the new connections:\n    *   A new `C2-C7` bond forms. This connects the `CH(CH₃)` unit (from C2 and C1) to the `CH(CH₂CH₃)` unit (from C7, C8, C9). This gives a central `...-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-...` fragment.\n    *   A new `C3=C4` double bond forms. C3 was `CH` and C4 was `CH₂`. This creates a `CH=CH₂` (vinyl) group. This vinyl group is attached to C2 of the new central fragment.\n    *   A new `C5=C6` double bond forms. C5 was `CH(Butyl)` and C6 was `CH`. This creates a `(Butyl)CH=CH...` group. This group is attached to C7 of the new central fragment.\n\n    Assembling these pieces gives the following structure for the product:\n    `CH₂=CH - CH(CH₃) - CH(CH₂CH₃) - CH=CH - (CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n\n5.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Rules:**\n    Now we need to find the correct IUPAC name for this new molecule.\n    *   **Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the double bonds).**\n        We must number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Starting from the `CH₂=` end:\n        `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(5)=CH(6)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₂(9)-CH₃(10)`\n    *   The longest chain has 10 carbons, so the parent name is **deca**.\n    *   There are two double bonds, starting at C1 and C5. So it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Identify and locate the substituents.** There is a methyl group at C3 and an ethyl group at C4.\n    *   **Assemble the full name.** List the substituents alphabetically: `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option C exactly.\n\nAs a final check, we can verify that the molecular formula is conserved.\n*   **Starting Material:** 5-butylnona-2,6-diene (C₉ chain + C₄ butyl = C₁₃). The formula for an acyclic diene is CₙH₂ₙ₋₂. So, C₁₃H₂(₁₃)₋₂ = C₁₃H₂₄.\n*   **Product:** 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene (C₁₀ chain + C₁ methyl + C₂ ethyl = C₁₃). The formula is also C₁₃H₂₄.\nThe molecular formula is conserved, and the rearrangement follows a standard, well-established chemical reaction pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
