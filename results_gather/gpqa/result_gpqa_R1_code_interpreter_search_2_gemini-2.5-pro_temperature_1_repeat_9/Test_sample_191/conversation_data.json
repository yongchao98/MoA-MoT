    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   A negative charge will be attracted towards the `+q` charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To make the electric field zero inside the material of the conductor (a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium), the total induced charge on the inner surface must be exactly `-q`. This can be shown by applying Gauss's law to a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conductor material and encloses the cavity. Since the field E is 0 everywhere on this surface, the net charge enclosed must be 0. Thus, `q_enclosed = q_inside_cavity + q_inner_surface = +q + q_inner_surface = 0`, which implies `q_inner_surface = -q`.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n    *   `q_total = q_inner_surface + q_outer_surface = 0`\n    *   `-q + q_outer_surface = 0`\n    *   `q_outer_surface = +q`\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside the conductor from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity. The charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface are arranged in such a way that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself to be in equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetric arrangement of charges inside the cavity, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The center of this sphere is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n7.  **Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's size (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are all irrelevant for finding the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors. The external field only depends on the net charge enclosed within the cavity and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, this ignores the conductor)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form based on irrelevant parameters)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form based on irrelevant parameters)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
