    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded (downfield), broad singlet is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which means these protons are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group, the carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methine and a methyl group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton) and other alkyl groups.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   We have a benzoic acid core.\n        *   There is a second substituent at the *para* (4) position.\n        *   Let's assemble the alkyl chain: We have a -CH group attached to the ring. This CH is also attached to a -CH₃ (the doublet at 1.4 ppm) and a -CH₂- group (part of the multiplet at 1.7 ppm). This -CH₂- group is in turn attached to a -CH₃ (the triplet at 0.9 ppm).\n        *   The alkyl group is: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   Therefore, the full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, including the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group, will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Product:** The product will have a methyl group and a *sec*-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This matches the structure of our deduced final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
