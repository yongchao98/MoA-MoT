    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   We are dealing with a three-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a sphere centered on the Sun with a radius `d`. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd^3`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere (i.e., up to a distance `d`) is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd^3`\n    *   From this, we can see that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d^3`.\n\n3.  **Introducing Parallax (plx):**\n    *   Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n        `d = 1 / plx`\n    *   Note: This formula is exact when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. For our purposes, the key is the inverse proportionality: `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we can express the total number of stars `N` as a function of parallax by substituting `d = 1/plx` into our relation `N(d) ∝ d^3`.\n    *   `N(plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3 = 1/plx^3`\n    *   It is important to understand what `N(plx)` represents. Since a smaller distance `d` corresponds to a *larger* parallax `plx`, `N(plx)` represents the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`.\n\n5.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is a rate of change, which mathematically corresponds to a derivative. We are looking for the distribution function, which is `|dN/d(plx)|`.\n    *   Let's differentiate `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Since `N(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^3` (or `plx^-3`), we can write `N(plx) = C * plx^-3` where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx^-3]`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, `d(x^n)/dx = n*x^(n-1)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3) * plx^(-3-1) = -3C * plx^-4`\n    *   So, `dN/d(plx) = -3C / plx^4`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that the total count of stars `N(plx)` decreases as `plx` increases (which makes sense, as a larger parallax threshold means we are considering a smaller volume of space).\n    *   The number of stars in a small interval of parallax `d(plx)` is what we are interested in, and its density is the magnitude of this derivative.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = |-3C / plx^4| = 3C / plx^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `|dN/d(plx)|`, is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is `~ 1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
