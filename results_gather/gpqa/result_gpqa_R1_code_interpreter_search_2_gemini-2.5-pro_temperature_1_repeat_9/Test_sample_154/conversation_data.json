    "The user wants to find the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ is given by the formula:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A$.\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe need to calculate two quantities:\n1. The expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n2. The expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\nFirst, let's find the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all the components are real, it's simply the transpose:\n$\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar) \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we apply the operator $P_z^2$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root to find $\\Delta P_z$:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe information about the operators $P_x$ and $P_y$, and the fact that the state is an eigenstate of $P_x$, is extra information confirming the validity of the state vector, but it is not required for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
