    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The intensity of this peak is about 32% of the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:33) is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this signal to be exceptionally broad.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for an aromatic carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H peak and the C=O peak strongly indicates that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the definitive signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**H**). It is a singlet because it is acidic and undergoes rapid chemical exchange.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   There are a total of 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons, which means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The fact that there are only two signals, both of which are doublets, points to a high degree of symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. Each proton has only one adjacent proton to couple with, resulting in a doublet.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's combine all the evidence:\n*   The molecule contains one chlorine atom.\n*   It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   It has a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure must be a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom in the para (4) position. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nNow, let's check if this structure matches the provided options and data:\n\n**A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂\n*   **MW:** (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. **Matches MS.**\n*   **Functional Group:** Contains a carboxylic acid. **Matches IR.**\n*   **NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton and a 1,4-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. **Matches ¹H NMR.**\n\n**B) Phenyl chloroformate**\n*   Does not have a carboxylic acid group (no O-H). **Inconsistent with IR and NMR.**\n\n**C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**\n*   This is an ortho-substituted ring. The 4 aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets). **Inconsistent with ¹H NMR.**\n\n**D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**\n*   This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would show an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm), not a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It also only has 3 aromatic protons. **Inconsistent with ¹H NMR.**\n\nThe only structure that perfectly fits all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
