    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The standard formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write it out using the formula:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem provides several key pieces of information that allow for simplification:\n    *   Both planets orbit the *same star*, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both calculations and will cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the *same albedo*, so `A1 = A2`. This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n    *   The factor of `sqrt(1/2)` also cancels out.\n\n    After canceling these common terms, the ratio simplifies significantly:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    This is a crucial simplification. The problem now is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Properties:** The problem gives us the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`) by the formula: `Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c`. The *maximum* Doppler shift corresponds to the star's radial velocity *amplitude*, denoted by `K`.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\n    The radial velocity amplitude `K` for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_orb\n    where `v_orb` is the planet's orbital velocity, `v_orb = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. (Note: this is a simplification assuming M_p << M_star, which is valid here).\n\n    Substituting `v_orb` into the equation for `K`:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n6.  **Find the Relationship for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):** I need to find the ratio `a2 / a1`. Let's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`.\n    K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)  (because `sin(i)`, `M_star`, and `G` are constants in this context. The transit detection implies `sin(i) ≈ 1` for both).\n\n    Let's write this as a proportionality for each planet:\n    *   `K1 ∝ M_p1 / sqrt(a1)`\n    *   `K2 ∝ M_p2 / sqrt(a2)`\n\n    Now, let's take the ratio `K1 / K2`:\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M_p2 / sqrt(a2))`\n    `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Desired Ratio:** My goal is to find `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, which I've already determined is equal to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`. I can now solve the equation from the previous step for `sqrt(a2 / a1)`:\n    `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n    This gives a direct path to the answer.\n\n8.  **Plug in the Values:** Now I can substitute the given values into this final expression.\n    *   **Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2):** This is proportional to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n        `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n    *   **Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n\n    Now, calculate the temperature ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3 / 4) * (5 / 7) = 15 / 28`\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** I'll perform the final division to get a decimal answer and compare it to the options.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (which is the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes K1/K2)\nratio_K = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M_p2/M_p1)\nratio_M = 5 / 7\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is given by (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1)\ntemperature_ratio = ratio_K * ratio_M\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Write Down the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate and Simplify the Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nWe can simplify this based on the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same and cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2), so the (1 - A) term cancels out.\n*   The constant `sqrt(1/2)` also cancels out.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis (a):**\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max), which is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K). For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for K is:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / sqrt(M_star * a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, 'a' is the semi-major axis, and 'i' is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince both planets were detected via the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. As they orbit the same star, M_star is constant. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\nK ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)\n\n**5. Establish a Relationship between the Two Planets:**\nLet's write the proportionality for each planet:\n*   K1 ∝ M_p1 / sqrt(a1)\n*   K2 ∝ M_p2 / sqrt(a2)\n\nNow, let's take the ratio of the two:\nK1 / K2 = (M_p1 / sqrt(a1)) / (M_p2 / sqrt(a2))\nK1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n**6. Solve for the Temperature Ratio:**\nWe previously found that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). We can substitute this into the equation from step 5:\nK1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\nNow, we can rearrange this to solve for the temperature ratio we want:\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)**\n\n**7. Plug in the Given Values:**\n*   The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2):\n    K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n*   The ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1) is:\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5/7\n\n**8. Final Calculation:**\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option B.\n\nThe Python code executed in the background performed this final calculation:\n`(0.03 / 0.04) * (5 / 7) = 0.75 * 0.714... = 0.5357...`\n\n<<<B>>>"
