    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled angular momentum state is given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This notation tells us:\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system: $l = 2$.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number: $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement being performed.**\n    A measurement is made on the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalues of these operators are given by $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n\n3.  **Identify the desired outcome of the measurement.**\n    We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue = $-\\hbar$ implies $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue = $-\\hbar$ implies $m_2 = -1$.\n    The state corresponding to this measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis is $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ (short for $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$). The expansion is given by:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    where the coefficients $C_{m_1, m_2}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted as $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$.\n\n5.  **Apply the fundamental rule of angular momentum addition.**\n    A key principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This translates to the quantum numbers as:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This is a strict selection rule. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is zero unless this condition is met.\n\n6.  **Check if the condition is met for the desired outcome.**\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ when it is initially in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the two states:\n    $P = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>|^2$\n    $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    The term inside the modulus is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$.\n    Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe measurement outcome is physically impossible because it violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired measurement outcome has a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. As these are not equal, the probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
