    "An analysis of the solar neutrino sources and the hypothetical scenario is required to determine the flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources and their Energies\n\nFirst, let's list the relevant neutrino-producing reactions in the Sun and their energy characteristics:\n\n*   **pp-I Chain:**\n    *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νₑ` (pp neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n*   **pp-II Chain:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ` (⁷Be neutrinos): Monoenergetic lines at 861 keV (~90% of the time) and 383 keV (~10% of the time). This reaction is **not** affected by the shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n*   **pp-III Chain:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ` (⁸B neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. This is the reaction that **stops** in the proposed scenario.\n*   **CNO Cycle:**\n    *   Includes reactions like `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decay, which produce neutrinos with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These reactions are assumed to continue normally but their contribution to the Sun's total energy output is only about 1%, making their neutrino flux significantly lower than the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the pp-III Stoppage\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch stops, which means the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero. We now analyze the remaining sources in the two specified energy bands.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700-800 keV**\n    *   pp neutrinos: Max energy is 420 keV, so they do not contribute.\n    *   ⁷Be neutrinos: Lines are at 383 keV and 861 keV, outside this band.\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos: Flux is zero due to the pp-III stoppage.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining sources of neutrinos in this energy band are from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos). The flux from the CNO cycle is known to be relatively low.\n\n*   **Band 2: 800-900 keV**\n    *   The dominant feature in this band is the very strong, monoenergetic **⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV**. This line originates from the pp-II branch, which is explicitly stated to be unaffected.\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos: Flux is zero.\n    *   CNO neutrinos also contribute a small amount of continuous flux in this band.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be neutrino line. The contribution from the CNO cycle is negligible in comparison.\n\n### 3. Estimate the Ratio of the Fluxes\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio: `Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2)`\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is the flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range. The total flux from the relevant CNO reactions (`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`) is approximately 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. This flux is spread over a broad energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV). Only a small fraction of this total flux will fall within the 100 keV-wide Band 1.\n\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** This is almost entirely the flux of the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line. The total flux for ⁷Be neutrinos is ~5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, and about 90% of this is in the 861 keV line. So, the flux in this band is approximately 4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\nLet's compare the orders of magnitude:\n*   Flux(band 1) ≈ (A small fraction of the CNO flux) ≈ A fraction of ~5 x 10⁸\n*   Flux(band 2) ≈ (The ⁷Be line flux) ≈ 4.5 x 10⁹\n\nThe total CNO flux is already about 10 times smaller than the total ⁷Be flux. Furthermore, we are only taking a small slice of the CNO spectrum for the numerator, while almost all the ⁷Be flux is concentrated in the denominator's band.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is significantly smaller than the denominator. Let's make a quantitative estimate. If we approximate that about 10% of the CNO flux falls in Band 1, the calculation is:\n\nRatio ≈ (0.10 * 5 x 10⁸) / (4.5 x 10⁹)\nRatio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (4.5 x 10⁹)\nRatio ≈ 0.011\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01.\n\nFinal reasoning: The flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes very small (only low-flux CNO sources remain), while the flux in the 800-900 keV band remains very large due to the dominant ⁷Be line. The ratio of a small number to a large number that is about 100 times bigger results in a value of approximately 10⁻².\n\n<<<C>>>"
