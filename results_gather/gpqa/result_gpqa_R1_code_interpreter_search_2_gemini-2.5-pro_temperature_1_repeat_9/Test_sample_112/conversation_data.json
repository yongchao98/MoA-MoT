    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at an m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) of 45 is a very common and indicative fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectroscopic data points unambiguously to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). We need to determine which formula is consistent with the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene. We can do this by calculating the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   Our unknown compound has a C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) and a C=C double bond (the alkene). This means it must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 2).\n\n*   **Calculating DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accounts for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a carboxylic acid (with the C=O bond) or a cyclic ester, but it cannot also contain a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence (carboxylic acid, alkene, and fragment at m/z=45) is C6H10O2. An example of such a compound would be hex-4-enoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
