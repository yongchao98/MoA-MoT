As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data\n\nFirst, let's list the resistance levels for each genotype and calculate the \"loss of resistance\" compared to the 100% control.\n\n*   **Control (Wild-Type):** 100% resistance (0% loss)\n*   **g1 (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance (25% loss)\n*   **g2 (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance (100% loss)\n*   **g3 (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance (50% loss)\n*   **g1g2 (double knock-out):** 0% resistance (100% loss)\n*   **g2g3 (double knock-out):** 0% resistance (100% loss)\n*   **g1g3 (double knock-out):** 10% resistance (90% loss)\n\n### 2. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n\n*   The `g2` single mutant shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This indicates that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n*   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving `g2`.\n    *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance, which is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype.\n    *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance, again identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype.\n*   This is the classic definition of **epistasis**. When the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants, the corresponding gene (`G2` in this case) is said to be **epistatic** to the other gene(s) (`G1` and `G3`).\n*   In a genetic pathway, an epistatic gene often acts upstream of the gene(s) it masks. Since `G2` is essential and epistatic to both `G1` and `G3`, it is very likely a master regulator at the top of the pathway. The problem states that at least one gene is a **transcription factor**, and this role fits perfectly for G2, which would activate the downstream genes required for resistance.\n\n**Conclusion 1: G2 is likely a transcription factor that acts upstream of G1 and G3.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3\n\n*   The `g1` single mutant has a 25% loss of resistance.\n*   The `g3` single mutant has a 50% loss of resistance.\n*   If the genes acted independently and their effects were additive, we would expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a total loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, resulting in 25% resistance.\n*   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is only 10% (a 90% loss).\n*   This effect, where the double mutant shows a much more severe phenotype than the sum of the individual mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n*   Synergism between two gene knock-outs strongly suggests that the genes have **redundant or overlapping functions**. They likely act in parallel pathways or contribute to the same process, so when one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is almost completely lost.\n\n**Conclusion 2: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (or have synergistic, overlapping functions).**\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nNow let's evaluate each option based on our conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   G2 is a better candidate for the main TF than G1. We cannot determine pleiotropy from this experiment. While \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is true, the other parts are weak or untestable.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct**, as per our analysis.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": **Correct**, as evidenced by their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is technically incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic, the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) should be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not. However, the first two claims in this option are the strongest and most important conclusions from the data.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   We cannot conclude they have the same promoter. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   We cannot conclude pleiotropy. \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nOption B contains the two most accurate and significant conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment: G2 is a master upstream regulator (likely a TF), and G1 and G3 have redundant functions. Although its third clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect by a strict definition, it is by far the best description among the choices provided. In the context of a multiple-choice question, you select the option that is the most correct.\n\n<<<B>>>"
