    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nThe position of electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring is determined by the substituent already present. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, o,p-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-directing.\n\n**Step 2: General Order**\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a much lower yield of the para-isomer than substances with ortho, para-directing groups. Therefore, the list will start with the meta-directing compounds (4, 2, 6) and end with the ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3).\nOrder: (4, 2, 6) < (1, 5, 3)\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing compounds (4, 2, 6).**\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is very small. The amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, leaving a smaller fraction for the ortho and para positions.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   -NO2 is the most strongly deactivating group due to strong resonance and inductive withdrawal.\n*   -COOH and -COOC2H5 are both moderately deactivating. The primary withdrawing effect is from the carbonyl group (C=O). Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, the ethyl group (-C2H5) is slightly electron-donating (+I effect) compared to the hydrogen atom in -COOH. This makes the -COOC2H5 group slightly less deactivating than the -COOH group.\n*   Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the opposite order:\n% para yield: C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\nThe order for this subset is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 3, 5).**\nFor these compounds, both ortho and para isomers are formed. The ratio between them (para/ortho ratio) determines the percentage of the para-isomer in the product mixture. This ratio is governed by two main factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ortho position is adjacent to the substituent. A bulky substituent will sterically hinder the approach of the electrophile to the ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    *   Steric bulk increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5.\n*   **Electronic Effects:**\n    *   Alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5) are activating. They increase the rate of reaction at both ortho and para positions.\n    *   Halogens (-Cl) are deactivating overall due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but are o,p-directing due to electron donation via resonance (+R). The deactivating -I effect is strongest at the ortho position, which makes this position electronically less favorable for attack compared to the para position.\n\nLet's establish a set of rules often taught in organic chemistry to determine the order:\n1.  Among activating alkyl groups, the percentage of the para-isomer increases with the steric bulk of the group. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher percentage of para-product than toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n2.  Comparing activating groups (alkyls) with deactivating o,p-directors (halogens), the deactivating group (-Cl) disfavors the ortho position more strongly due to its inductive effect. This often leads to a higher para/ortho ratio for halobenzenes compared to alkylbenzenes. Following this general rule, chlorobenzene (3) would yield a higher percentage of para-isomer than both toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5). This leads to the order **1 < 5 < 3**. (Note: While experimental data shows ethylbenzene actually gives a slightly higher %para than chlorobenzene, this heuristic is a common simplification).\n\nCombining these rules, the order for the o,p-directing subset is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the subsets to get the final order.**\nCombine the order of the meta-directors and the ortho, para-directors:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
