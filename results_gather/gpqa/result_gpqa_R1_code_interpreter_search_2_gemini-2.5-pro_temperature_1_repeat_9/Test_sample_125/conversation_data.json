    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n    *   Starting with the (S) configuration at C5, the new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity, but they are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is inverted). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The diketone is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both carbonyl groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the products will be a mixture of all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a special case. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This makes it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **Separation of Enantiomers vs. Diastereomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute as a separate, **second peak**. This gives a total of **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   **Combined Analysis:** The products of Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols). It is extremely unlikely that any of these compounds would have the exact same polarity to co-elute.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The differing interactions between the enantiomers of a chiral analyte and the chiral stationary phase allow for their separation.\n*   **Separation Ability:** A chiral column can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers in a mixture (assuming the column is effective for the given compounds).\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The final mixture contains a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct, and a chiral column can resolve them all, each will produce a separate peak.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
