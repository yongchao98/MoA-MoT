    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (alkene region) suggests two chemically equivalent vinylic protons. This high symmetry is characteristic of a molecule like maleic anhydride.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR data supports this: two vinylic carbons (CH=CH) are equivalent (peak at 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O) are equivalent (peak at 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula. The structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds (cyclopenta-1,3-diene core, C₅H₆) where four hydrogens are replaced by methyl groups. The base diene has a CH₂ group and four CH groups. The methyl groups replace the H's on the four CH groups. So the structure is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄.\n    *   The formula is C = 5 + 4 = 9 and H = 2 + 4*3 = 14. So, the formula is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and the products.**\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **The Products:** This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. The reaction is stereoselective and typically yields two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically favored product but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** Let's check the formula of the product: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the question.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure and stereochemistry of the products.**\nLet's draw the general structure of the product and identify the different types of protons.\nThe product is a derivative of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\nDue to a plane of symmetry, we can identify four sets of equivalent protons:\n1.  **Bridgehead methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on C1 and C4. Total integral: **6H**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be upfield. Let's assign them the **~1.0 ppm** signal.\n2.  **Vinylic methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Total integral: **6H**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be downfield compared to the other methyls. Let's assign them the **~1.7 ppm** signal.\n3.  **Anhydride junction protons:** Two equivalent protons on C5 and C6 (let's call them H₅/H₆). Total integral: **2H**. These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained system, so they will be significantly downfield. Let's assign them the **~3.5 ppm** singlet.\n4.  **Bridge protons:** Two diastereotopic protons of the CH₂ group at C7. Total integral: **2H**. They will likely appear as two separate signals, each with an integral of 1H, coupled to each other (geminal coupling). One of these is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY data to distinguish between the major and minor products.**\nThe key to solving the problem is understanding the spatial arrangement of protons in the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** In the endo adduct, the bulky anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the C7 bridge. This forces the H₅ and H₆ protons to be in the *exo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Key spatial proximity:** The H₅/H₆ protons are close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Expected NOE:** A cross-peak between the H₅/H₆ signal (~3.5 ppm) and the C7 proton signals (e.g., ~1.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** In the exo adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the C7 bridge. This forces the H₅ and H₆ protons into the *endo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge and towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Key spatial proximity:** The H₅/H₆ protons are close to the vinylic methyl groups on C2 and C3.\n    *   **Expected NOE:** A cross-peak between the H₅/H₆ signal (~3.5 ppm) and the vinylic methyl signal (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the cross-peak described in the question.**\nThe question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our analysis, the NOE between H₅/H₆ and the C7 protons is unique to the major (endo) product.\n*   The NOE between H₅/H₆ and the vinylic methyls is unique to the minor (exo) product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak mentioned in the question must be the one between the H₅/H₆ protons and one of the C7 protons.\n\nLet's match this to the options provided:\n*   **Resonances involved:**\n    *   H₅/H₆ signal: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   C7 proton signal: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **Option C:** \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" perfectly matches the description of the NOE interaction that is uniquely present in the major product.\n\nLet's briefly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton). These are close in both isomers, so this NOE would not be unique to the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H₅/H₆). This NOE is characteristic of the *minor* product, not the major one.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These are on adjacent carbons and would show an NOE in both isomers.\n\nThus, the only option consistent with all the data is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
