    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the number of atoms in different energy states to the temperature.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   E_j and E_i are the energies of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the ratio of excitation:** The term \"excitation\" refers to this ratio, N_j / N_i. Let's denote this ratio as R.\n    R = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n4.  **Apply the given information to the two stars:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1, the excitation ratio is R_1.\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2, the excitation ratio is R_2.\n    *   The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Therefore, R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n\n5.  **Set up the equation based on the problem statement:**\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    Substituting these into R_1 = 2 * R_2:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term (g_j / g_i) is a property of the specific energy levels of the iron atom and is the same for both stars. Thus, it can be canceled from both sides of the equation:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n7.  **Solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2:** To remove the exponentials, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    Using the logarithm properties (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):**\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):**\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n10. **Combine the fractions in the parentheses:** The common denominator is T_1 * T_2.\n    (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 / (T_1*T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1*T_2)) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n11. **Evaluate the constant factor (ΔE / k):**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n    *   The ratio (ΔE / k) is therefore:\n        (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n    *   The problem is structured such that this pre-factor is equal to 1.\n\n12. **Write the final equation:** Substituting (ΔE / k) = 1 into the equation from step 10:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n13. **Compare with the given options:** This derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
