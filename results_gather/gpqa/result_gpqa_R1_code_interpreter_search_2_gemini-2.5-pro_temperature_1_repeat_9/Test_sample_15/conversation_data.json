    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (or chiral centers). A stereocenter is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. To determine if it's optically active, we look for chiral centers. A chiral center is an sp3 hybridized carbon with four different substituents.\n    *   There are no sp3 carbons with four different substituents. C3 has two hydrogens, and C4 has three hydrogens. The sp2 carbons of the double bond are not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule does not have other sources of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself provides the stereochemical configuration of two centers: `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of at least two stereocenters.\n    *   A compound with a specific R/S designation is a single stereoisomer. For it to be optically inactive, it would have to be a meso compound.\n    *   The structure is complex and asymmetrically substituted with an `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` group. Due to this complexity and lack of symmetry, it is extremely unlikely to have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this specific stereoisomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   We need to check if the (2R,3S) isomer is a meso compound. Let's draw its Fischer projection.\n        ```\n            COOH\n             |\n      CH3 ---|--- H    (C2 is R)\n        -----|-----    (Plane of symmetry)\n        H ---|--- CH3    (C3 is S)\n             |\n            COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereoisomers are (2R,3R), (2S,3S), and the meso (2R,3S).\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Thus, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. Let's check the carbon with the -OH group (C1).\n    *   C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path one way around the ring), and 4) -CH=CH-CH2- (path the other way). These two paths are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Hence, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, with their relative stereochemistry specified. The `s,s,s` designation implies they are all configured the same way, which points to the all-`cis` isomer.\n    *   In the all-`cis` isomer (where all OH groups are on the same side of the ring, e.g., all equatorial in the stable chair form), the molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring paths: `-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-`. These two paths are identical. Therefore, C1 is not a stereocenter (it is a prochiral center). The same applies to C3 and C5.\n    *   This molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
