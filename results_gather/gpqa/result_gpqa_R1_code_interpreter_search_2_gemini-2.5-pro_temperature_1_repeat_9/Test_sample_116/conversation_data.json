    "**1. Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to check if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond. There are large, bulky substituents at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') relative to the bond connecting the rings.\n    *   **Chirality Type:** This molecule is a candidate for a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The bulky groups (nitro, -NO2, and dimethyl carboxylate, -COOCH3) at all four ortho-positions prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Because of this restricted rotation, the rings are forced into a non-planar arrangement. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Imagine its mirror image; you would not be able to superimpose the original molecule onto it.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Type:** We need to look for a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group, -OH). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral (unless it's part of a racemic mixture).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. A central carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: **Chiral** (atropisomerism)\n*   Compound 2: **Chiral** (chiral center)\n*   Compound 3: **Achiral** (plane of symmetry)\n*   Compound 4: **Achiral** (planar, has a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry)\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
