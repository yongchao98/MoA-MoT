    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which is the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride activates the carboxylic acid, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    CH3COOH + Br2 --> Br-CH2-COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactants:** α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is a Fischer esterification. A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Reaction:** The carboxyl group of bromoacetic acid is esterified by ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN --> NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2COOCH2CH3), Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is an alkylation of an active methylene compound, followed by an intramolecular cyclization.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (a strong base) removes one of the acidic protons from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH --> [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br --> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate formed still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates this intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH --> [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring consists of the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n```\n      CN\n      |\n      C -- C(=O)OCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n  H2C---CH2\n  |       |\n H2C---CH2\n    \\   /\n     CH2\n```\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nOn average (due to rapid chair-flipping and bond rotation), the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes the molecule achiral.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. They are coupled to the adjacent CH2 group and will appear as a triplet. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** The two protons of the methylene group are chemically equivalent (they are enantiotopic because the molecule is achiral). They are coupled to the CH3 group and will appear as a quartet. This is **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry passes through C1 and C4. This makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** There are four such protons. On any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two geminal protons (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. This means they are in different chemical environments and give different signals. The plane of symmetry makes the \"axial\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"axial\" proton on C6, and the \"equatorial\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"equatorial\" on C6. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The four protons on these carbons are also split into two sets of equivalent diastereotopic protons. This gives **2 signals** (each integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Protons on C4:** There are two protons on C4. These two geminal protons are also diastereotopic because they are in a ring with a substituted, prochiral carbon (C1). They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals** (each integrating to 1H).\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Ethyl -CH3: 1 signal\n*   Ethyl -OCH2-: 1 signal\n*   Ring C2/C6 protons: 2 signals\n*   Ring C3/C5 protons: 2 signals\n*   Ring C4 protons: 2 signals\n\nTotal number of distinct hydrogen signals = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
