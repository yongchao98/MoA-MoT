    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4 and identify B, D, and H.**\n    *   Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) (1:1 ratio).\n    *   Many simple gases could be B and D. A common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, b.p. 8 °C, used as a solvent).\n    *   Let's hypothesize: B = Cl₂ (gas), D = CO (gas), and H = COCl₂ (phosgene).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 3 using the identity of B.**\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n    *   From step 1, B is Cl₂. The product C is formed from A and B (Cl₂), so C must be a chloride compound of A.\n    *   The hydrolysis of C produces two acids, F and G. This suggests the chlorine from C is involved in the formation of these acids.\n    *   Chlorine gas (Cl₂) disproportionates in water: Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO.\n    *   Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid. Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is a weak acid.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description of F and G. So, F = HCl and G = HClO.\n    *   This reaction also consumes Cl₂. For C to hydrolyze and produce HCl and HClO, it must be able to release chlorine. The reaction also regenerates A. This suggests that C might be an inclusion compound or clathrate where Cl₂ molecules are \"trapped\" by solid A.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1 with the clathrate hypothesis.**\n    *   Reaction 1: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> bright red product C.\n    *   Substituting B = Cl₂, the reaction is: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> C(red).\n    *   If C is a clathrate, its formula would be A·(Cl₂)₈. This satisfies the 1:8 stoichiometry.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction (Reaction 3) would then be: A·(Cl₂)₈ + H₂O -> A(s) + 8HCl + 8HClO. This is consistent with A being regenerated and the formation of the strong acid F (HCl) and weak acid G (HClO).\n    *   While the existence of a *bright red* clathrate of this specific type is not common knowledge, it provides a chemically consistent explanation for the puzzle's constraints. We will proceed assuming this model is correct.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 to identify E.**\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E (extremely hazardous).\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: C = A·(Cl₂)₈ and D = CO.\n    *   The reaction is: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO -> E.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is that the trapped chlorine molecules react with carbon monoxide.\n    *   Cl₂ + CO -> COCl₂ (phosgene).\n    *   The stoichiometry C + 2D suggests that two molecules of CO react. They would react with two molecules of the trapped Cl₂: 2Cl₂ + 2CO -> 2COCl₂.\n    *   The problem states this produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\". This identifies E as phosgene, COCl₂. Phosgene is a well-known and extremely hazardous chemical agent. Note that Reaction 2 does not state E is the *only* product; the remaining clathrate A·(Cl₂)₆ would be a byproduct.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E.**\n    *   We have identified E as phosgene, COCl₂.\n    *   The molecular structure of phosgene is trigonal planar around the central carbon atom, with a double bond to oxygen and single bonds to the two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The molecule has the following symmetry elements:\n        *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O double bond.\n        *   A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms of the molecule.\n        *   A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σᵥ'} corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options.**\n    *   A) C₂\n    *   B) D₄h\n    *   C) C₂v\n    *   D) D∞h\n    *   Our determined point group is C₂ᵥ, which matches option C."
