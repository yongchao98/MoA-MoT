    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given about the compound's structure and spectra.\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other functional groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (R₁-C₆H₄-R₂), the protons are chemically non-equivalent but often form a symmetric AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a **doublet of quartets (dq)** means the proton is coupled to one neighboring proton (giving the doublet splitting) and three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   A signal that is a **doublet (d)** means the proton is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor (d). So, one substituent is a propenyl group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. We have already identified one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃).\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the molecule contains no methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called double bond equivalents) tells us the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule. We can deduce the required DBE from the structural features:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   **B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   **D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nComparing the calculated DBEs with the required DBE of 6, we can immediately eliminate options **C (DBE=5)** and **D (DBE=7)**. We are left with options A and B.\n\n### **3. Differentiate Between the Remaining Options (A and B)**\n\nWe need to decide between C₁₂H₁₄O₂ and C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's try to construct a molecule for each formula that fits all the NMR data.\n\n**Case 1: Formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nLet's assemble the fragments we identified:\n*   Aromatic ring core: C₆H₄\n*   Propenyl substituent: -CH=CH-CH₃, which has a formula of C₃H₅.\n*   An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃). Both have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\nLet's sum the atoms for a potential structure like **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**:\n*   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11\n*   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12\n*   Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n*   **Total Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nThis structure has no -CH₂- groups and fits all the described NMR signals. Therefore, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Case 2: Formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂**\n\nThis formula has one more carbon and two more hydrogens (a -CH₂- unit) than C₁₁H₁₂O₂. To build a molecule with this formula that contains the required aromatic, vinyl, and ester groups, we would need to add a -CH₂- group to the C₁₁H₁₂O₂ structure.\n*   For example, we could have an ethyl ester instead of a methyl ester (Ar-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   Or we could have a butenyl group instead of a propenyl group (Ar-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃).\n*   In any plausible arrangement, adding a CH₂ unit would introduce a methylene group into the molecule. This would produce a signal for a -CH₂- group in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**. This directly contradicts the requirements for a C₁₂H₁₄O₂ formula, as it's impossible to construct such a molecule with the given fragments without including a -CH₂- group.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n1.  The required Degree of Unsaturation is 6, which eliminates options C and D.\n2.  The structural fragments deduced from the NMR data (especially the \"no -CH₂- groups\" constraint) can be assembled to form a molecule with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n3.  It is not possible to form a molecule with the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ that satisfies all the given spectral data, specifically the absence of -CH₂- signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
