    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, free cobalt ions (Co^2+) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (βn):\n- β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9\n- β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40\n- β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63\n- β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co^2+], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN-]:\n- [[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n- [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n- [[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n- [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n**3. Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, like [Co(SCN)2], is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as α2.\n\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2:\nα2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)\n\nBy factoring out [Co^2+] from the denominator, it cancels with the numerator:\nα2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex using only the stability constants and the free ligand concentration. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed for this specific calculation, as long as we can assume the free ligand concentration [SCN-] is known. Given that the thiocyanate (0.1 M) is in tenfold excess compared to cobalt (0.01 M), it's a safe assumption that the equilibrium concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n- [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n- β1 = 9\n- β2 = 40\n- β3 = 63\n- β4 = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n- 1\n- β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n- β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n- β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n- β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex:\nNumerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction (α2):\nα2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nWe can use Python to perform the calculation with higher precision:\n```python\n# Given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the alpha fraction\n# It is the sum of terms: 1 + beta_n * [L]^n for all species\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\n# The term for this species is beta2 * [L]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex is numerator / denominator\nfraction_co_scn2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_co_scn2 = fraction_co_scn2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_co_scn2)\n```\n>16.91618032648228\n\nThe result confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of chemical equilibrium involving the formation of coordination complexes. The goal is to find the percentage of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\nIn the solution, free cobalt ions Co²⁺ react with thiocyanate ligands SCN⁻ to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction (α₂):**\nWe want to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is equivalent to finding its mole fraction (α₂) and multiplying by 100.\n\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 1 into the formula for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nNow substitute this into the expression for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Assumption on ligand concentration:**\nThe problem gives the initial concentration of SCN⁻ as 0.1 M, which is ten times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in significant excess, we can approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator (let's call it Σ):\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe provided code execution confirms this calculation: `16.916180326482287`. This value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
