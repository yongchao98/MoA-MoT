    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. It involves the formation of an enolate from a ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Ketone (Nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of the ketone:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   Since only the C6 position has an α-proton, deprotonation must occur at this position. The bulky nature of t-BuOK would favor deprotonation at the less hindered site anyway, but here there is no other choice.\n    *   The abstraction of the proton at C6 forms an enolate ion where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The structure of ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt. The attack occurs at the CH₂ group.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   An intermediate enolate of the ester is formed, which is then protonated during the work-up step to give the final product.\n    *   The group added to C6 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the cyclohexanone skeleton with the original substituents (2-ethyl, 2-methyl, 6-methyl) and a new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group attached at C6.\n    *   Let's name the product based on the options provided, where ethyl propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The structure is of the form `(Cyclohexyl Ring)-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate substituted at position 3 (the carbon chain is C³H₂-C²H₂-C¹(=O)OEt). The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   Now, we need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment to the parent chain is C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. So, C1 of the substituent is the original C6.\n        *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent (`1-methyl`).\n        *   The ketone carbonyl (C=O) was at C1 in the starting material, which is adjacent to C6. So, the carbonyl is at C2 of the substituent (`2-oxo`).\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on C2 of the starting material. This carbon is adjacent to the ketone's C1, making it C3 in the substituent's numbering (C1(attach)-C2(keto)-C3). So, we have an ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction, specifically a nitro-Michael addition. A carbanion stabilized by a nitro group attacks an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane (Nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton Source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nitronate Ion:**\n    *   The base (KOH) abstracts an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group (NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   Deprotonation of C1 in 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-C**H**₂-NO₂) forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion, known as a nitronate ion.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate ion acts as a nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The structure of (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon, the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water at the α-carbon.\n\n5.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The new molecule is formed by connecting the C1 of 1-nitropropane to the C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n        *   1-nitropropane fragment: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-\n        *   but-2-enenitrile fragment: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   Combining them gives the final structure:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We identify and number the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl`).\n        *   A nitro group at C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
