    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space.\n\n**1. Understand the Density Matrix and the Qubit Space**\n\nA single qubit state can be represented as a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere. The position of this point is given by a vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz), known as the Bloch vector.\n\nThe relationship between a density matrix ρ and its Bloch vector **r** is given by the formula:\nρ = (1/2) * (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**) = (1/2) * (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\nwhere:\n*   I is the 2x2 identity matrix: I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n*   σx, σy, σz are the Pauli matrices:\n    *   σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n    *   σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    *   σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nPure states lie on the surface of the Bloch sphere (||**r**|| = 1), while mixed states are inside the sphere (||**r**|| < 1).\n\n**2. Express the Given Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\n\nThe given density matrix is:\nρ = (1/2) * (|0><0| + |1><1|)\n\nThe basis states |0> and |1> in matrix form are:\n*   |0> = [[1], [0]]\n*   |1> = [[0], [1]]\n\nFrom these, we can calculate the outer products |0><0| and |1><1|:\n*   |0><0| = [[1], [0]] * [1, 0] = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\n*   |1><1| = [[0], [1]] * [0, 1] = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for ρ:\nρ = (1/2) * ([[1, 0], [0, 0]] + [[0, 0], [0, 1]])\nρ = (1/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\nρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]\n\nThis is the identity matrix divided by 2. This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\n**3. Determine the Bloch Vector (r)**\n\nThere are two common ways to find the Bloch vector **r** from the density matrix ρ.\n\n**Method 1: Comparing Matrix Forms**\n\nWe equate the general form of ρ with the specific form we just calculated:\n(1/2) * [[1 + rz, rx - i*ry], [rx + i*ry, 1 - rz]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]\n\nBy comparing the matrix elements, we get a system of equations:\n*   Top-left: (1/2) * (1 + rz) = 1/2  => 1 + rz = 1 => rz = 0\n*   Top-right: (1/2) * (rx - i*ry) = 0 => rx - i*ry = 0 => rx = 0 and ry = 0\n*   Bottom-left: (1/2) * (rx + i*ry) = 0 => rx + i*ry = 0 => rx = 0 and ry = 0\n*   Bottom-right: (1/2) * (1 - rz) = 1/2 => 1 - rz = 1 => rz = 0\n\nAll equations consistently show that rx = 0, ry = 0, and rz = 0.\nTherefore, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n**Method 2: Using the Trace Formula**\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated directly using the formula:\nri = Tr(ρ * σi) for i = x, y, z\n\nLet's compute each component:\n*   **rx = Tr(ρ * σx)**\n    ρ * σx = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]]\n    Tr(ρ * σx) = 0 + 0 = 0. So, **rx = 0**.\n\n*   **ry = Tr(ρ * σy)**\n    ρ * σy = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]]\n    Tr(ρ * σy) = 0 + 0 = 0. So, **ry = 0**.\n\n*   **rz = Tr(ρ * σz)**\n    ρ * σz = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]]\n    Tr(ρ * σz) = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0. So, **rz = 0**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is given by its Bloch vector **r** = (0, 0, 0). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(1,1,0)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\nTo be certain, we can use a python script to perform the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the basis states\nket0 = np.array([[1], [0]])\nket1 = np.array([[0], [1]])\n\n# Define the outer products\nket0_bra0 = np.outer(ket0, ket0.conj())\nket1_bra1 = np.outer(ket1, ket1.conj())\n\n# Calculate the given density matrix rho\nrho = 0.5 * (ket0_bra0 + ket1_bra1)\n\n# Define the Pauli matrices\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the components of the Bloch vector r = (rx, ry, rz)\n# using the formula ri = Tr(rho * sigma_i)\nrx = np.trace(rho @ sigma_x)\nry = np.trace(rho @ sigma_y)\nrz = np.trace(rho @ sigma_z)\n\n# The Bloch vector r (taking the real part as imaginary parts are zero)\nr = (rx.real, ry.real, rz.real)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated density matrix is:\\n{rho}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated Bloch vector r is: {r}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated density matrix is:\n[[0.5 0. ]\n [0.  0.5]]\nThe calculated Bloch vector r is: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n\nThe code confirms that the Bloch vector for the given density matrix is (0, 0, 0).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The density matrix of a qubit can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices and the identity matrix as:\n\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z)$\n\nwhere **r** = $(r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the state's geometrical position in the qubit space (the Bloch sphere). The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the formula:\n\n$r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$\n\nLet's first write the given density matrix in matrix form.\nThe basis states are:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSo the density matrix is:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is the identity matrix divided by 2, which represents the maximally mixed state.\n\nNow, let's calculate the components of the Bloch vector **r**:\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n$\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i/2 \\\\ i/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).
