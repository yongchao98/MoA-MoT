    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options based on fundamental physics:** The density of a planet is determined by its mass and volume (Density = Mass / Volume). For planets with the same composition (like rocks and iron), the overall density is heavily influenced by gravitational compression. A more massive planet has stronger gravity, which compresses its material more, leading to a higher density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, the planet Earth. Its average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density (ρ_E).\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is much more massive (5 M_E), its own gravity will be significantly stronger. This stronger gravity will compress the rock and iron core much more than in Earth. Therefore, its overall density will be substantially *higher* than Earth's density.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive (0.5 M_E) than Earth. Its gravity will be weaker, resulting in less compression of its internal materials compared to Earth. Consequently, its overall density will be *lower* than Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the densities, it's clear that the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the densest due to the effect of gravitational compression.\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27. Since Density (ρ) ∝ M/R³, this leads to ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M^0.19.\n\n*   For planet (c), with M=5 M_E, its density would be approximately 5^0.19 ≈ 1.35 times Earth's density, or ~7.4 g/cm³.\n*   For planet (d), with M=0.5 M_E, its density would be approximately 0.5^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density, or ~4.8 g/cm³.\n\nThese calculations confirm that planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
