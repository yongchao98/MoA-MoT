    "This problem requires us to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n### 1. Understanding Transit Probability\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\nwhere:\n- `R_s` is the radius of the host star.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2:\n\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a2 / a1)`\n\n### 2. Using the Given Information\n\nLet's list the information provided in the problem:\n\n- **Orbital Periods:** The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2.\n  `P1 = P2 / 3`  or  `P2 / P1 = 3`\n- **Host Star Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2.\n  `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` or `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`\n- **Host Star Radii:** Both host stars have the same radii.\n  `R_s1 = R_s2` or `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n\nSubstituting the radii relationship into our ratio equation:\n\n`Ratio = (1) * (a2 / a1) = a2 / a1`\n\nSo, the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 3. Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes using Kepler's Third Law\n\nTo find the relationship between the semi-major axes (`a1` and `a2`), we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n\n`P^2 / a^3 = 4 * π^2 / (G * M_total)`\n\nwhere `M_total` is the total mass of the system (star + planet). Since the mass of an Earth-like planet is negligible compared to its host star's mass (`M_p << M_s`), we can approximate `M_total ≈ M_s`.\n\n`P^2 / a^3 ∝ 1 / M_s`\n\nRearranging to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n`a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`\n`a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can set up the ratio for `a2 / a1`:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n`a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (P2 / P1)^2 ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known ratios for mass and period:\n\n`a2 / a1 = [ (1/2) * (3)^2 ]^(1/3)`\n`a2 / a1 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n`a2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Final Ratio\n\nThe ratio of the probabilities is `p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a2 / a1`. To find the numerical value, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n# Calculate the ratio of the probabilities, which is (4.5)^(1/3)\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n1.650964001452144\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means:\n`p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 ≈ 1.65`\n`p_transit_1 ≈ 1.65 * p_transit_2`\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. The researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula**: The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p_transit = R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Ratio of Probabilities**: We want to compare the probability of Planet_1 (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`).\n    `Ratio = p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a2 / a1)`\n\n3.  **Applying Given Information**:\n    *   The problem states that both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. Therefore, the term `R_s1 / R_s2` is equal to 1.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to: `Ratio = a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Using Kepler's Third Law**: To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a2 / a1`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) and semi-major axis (`a`) to the mass of its host star (`M_s`).\n    `P² / a³ ∝ 1 / M_s`\n    Rearranging for `a`, we get:\n    `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: Now we can write the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (P₂ / P₁)² ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substituting the Known Values**:\n    *   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, so `P₂ / P₁ = 3`.\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)`\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: The ratio of the transit probabilities is equal to `a2 / a1`. The code you ran calculated this value:\n    `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n\n    This result means that `p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65`, or `p_1 ≈ 1.65 * p_2`.\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 is preferred for observation because it has approximately a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
