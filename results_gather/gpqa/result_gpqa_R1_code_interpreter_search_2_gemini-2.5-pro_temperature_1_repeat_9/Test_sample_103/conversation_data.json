    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n    The magnitude of this shift, Δλ, is related to the star's radial velocity, `v_r`, by the Doppler formula:\n    `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`\n    where `λ₀` is the rest wavelength and `c` is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift, `Δλ_max`, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as `K`. Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`.\n\n2.  **Relate Observed Data to Physical Parameters:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `Δλ_max1` = 5 miliangstroms\n    *   `Δλ_max2` = 7 miliangstroms\n    From the proportionality `K ∝ Δλ_max`, we can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between K and Orbital Period P:**\n    The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` for a star with a single planet in a circular orbit is:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane), and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\n    For a circular orbit, the planet's velocity is `v_p = 2πa / P`, where `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) and `P` is the orbital period.\n    So, `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (2πa / P)`\n\n    We use Kepler's Third Law to relate `a` and `P`. For a planet much less massive than its star (`M_p << M_star`):\n    `P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³`\n    Solving for `a`:\n    `a³ = (G * M_star * P²) / (4π²) `\n    `a = (G * M_star / (4π²))^(1/3) * P^(2/3)`\n\n    Now substitute this expression for `a` back into the equation for `K`:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (2π / P) * [(G * M_star / (4π²))^(1/3) * P^(2/3)]`\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * P^(-1) * P^(2/3) * (some constants involving G, M_star, and π)`\n    Let's group the terms by their dependence:\n    `K ∝ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Systems:**\n    We can write the ratio of `K` for the two systems:\n    `K2 / K1 = [ (M_p2 * sin(i2) / M_star2^(2/3)) * P2^(-1/3) ] / [ (M_p1 * sin(i1) / M_star1^(2/3)) * P1^(-1/3) ]`\n\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: `M_p1 ≈ M_p2`. We can assume they are equal.\n    *   The orbital inclinations `i1` and `i2` are not given. In such problems, when a parameter is not specified and a single numerical answer is expected, it is standard to assume that this parameter is the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume `i1 = i2`, which means `sin(i1) = sin(i2)`.\n\n    With these assumptions, all terms except `P` cancel out:\n    `K2 / K1 = P2^(-1/3) / P1^(-1/3)`\n    `K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P2 / P1):**\n    We need to rearrange the equation to solve for `P2 / P1`.\n    First, cube both sides:\n    `(K2 / K1)³ = P1 / P2`\n    Then, take the reciprocal:\n    `P2 / P1 = 1 / (K2 / K1)³ = (K1 / K2)³`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the known values `K1 = 5` and `K2 = 7`:\n    `P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³`\n    Let's perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1.\n# The relationship is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.\n# K1 is proportional to 5 miliangstrom.\n# K2 is proportional to 7 miliangstrom.\n\nK1_prop = 5\nK2_prop = 7\n\nratio = (K1_prop / K2_prop)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\n>>>\n0.3644314868804664\n<<<\n\nThe calculated ratio `P2 / P1` is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which can be written as `P2 / P1`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relating Observed Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of light from a star. The magnitude of the wavelength shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity `v_r`. The maximum observed periodic shift, `Δλ_max`, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, `K`.\n    Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n\n2.  **Determining the Ratio of Radial Velocity Semi-amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `Δλ_max1` = 5 miliangstroms (for planet #1's host star)\n    *   `Δλ_max2` = 7 miliangstroms (for planet #2's host star)\n    The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n    `K2 / K1 = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5`\n\n3.  **Deriving the Relationship between K and Orbital Period P:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is given by the formula:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    This formula shows that `K` is proportional to `P^(-1/3)` if all other factors are constant: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Applying the Relationship to the Two Systems:**\n    We are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`M_p1 ≈ M_p2`).\n    *   For a solvable problem without further information, we assume the orbital inclinations are statistically the same (`sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2)`).\n\n    With these parameters being equal for both systems, we can write the ratio:\n    `K2 / K1 = (P2^(-1/3)) / (P1^(-1/3)) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Ratio of Periods (P2 / P1):**\n    We need to rearrange the equation to solve for `P2 / P1`.\n    `P1 / P2 = (K2 / K1)³`\n    Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n    `P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Value:**\n    Now, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes (`K1 / K2 = 5 / 7`):\n    `P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³`\n    The Python code executed in the thinking process calculated this value:\n    `(5 / 7)³ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated value `~0.364` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
