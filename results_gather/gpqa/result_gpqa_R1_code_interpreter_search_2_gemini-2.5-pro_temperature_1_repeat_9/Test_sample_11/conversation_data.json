    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics, which can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n**1. Problem Setup:**\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nWe are given:\n*   The parent particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) = `M_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) = `M_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless, so its rest energy `M_nu * c^2` = 0 MeV.\n\nWe need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, KE(mu+) and KE(nu).\n\n**2. Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Initial energy (pion at rest): `E_initial = M_pi * c^2`\n    *   Final energy (sum of energies of products): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    *   Therefore: `M_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   Initial momentum (pion at rest): `p_initial = 0`\n    *   Final momentum (vector sum): `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n    *   Therefore: `0 = p_mu + p_nu`, which implies `p_mu = -p_nu`. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let `p = |p_mu| = |p_nu|`.\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n**4. Derivation:**\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can write the neutrino's energy as:\n`E_nu = M_pi*c^2 - E_mu`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its energy-momentum relation is `E_nu = p*c`. So:\n`p*c = M_pi*c^2 - E_mu`\n\nNow, let's use the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n`(p*c)^2 = E_mu^2 - (M_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `p*c` from the neutrino into the muon's equation:\n`(M_pi*c^2 - E_mu)^2 = E_mu^2 - (M_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(M_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(M_pi*c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 = E_mu^2 - (M_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_mu^2` terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for `E_mu`:\n`2*(M_pi*c^2)*E_mu = (M_pi*c^2)^2 + (M_mu*c^2)^2`\n`E_mu = [(M_pi*c^2)^2 + (M_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (M_pi*c^2)]`\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical values.\n\n**5. Calculation:**\n\nThe calculation will be performed using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nM_pi = 139.6\nM_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\n# E_mu = (M_pi^2 + M_mu^2) / (2 * M_pi)\nE_mu = (M_pi**2 + M_mu**2) / (2 * M_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu\n\n# The total energy of the neutrino is found by energy conservation\n# E_nu = M_pi - E_mu\nE_nu = M_pi - E_mu\n\n# Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> KE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\n> KE of nu = 29.78 MeV\n\nThe results from the calculation are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of mu(+) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of nu ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation is complete.\n\n**Reasoning Recap:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy of the stationary pion (`M_pi * c^2`) is converted into the total energies of the muon and the neutrino (`E_mu + E_nu`).\n    `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta (`p_mu = -p_nu`). Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2`\n    *   For the massless neutrino: `E_nu = p*c`\n\n4.  **Solving the System:** By substituting `p*c = E_nu` and `E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu` into the muon's energy equation, we solved for `E_mu`. Then we found the kinetic energies.\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python script performed the calculation:\n    *   `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`\n    *   `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV` (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
