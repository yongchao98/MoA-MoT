    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often beneficial to convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n*   x = r * cos(θ)\n*   y = r * sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nUsing these relationships, we can rewrite the terms in the potential:\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n*   r^2 * cos^2(θ) = (r * cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential expression V(r, θ) to get V(x, y):\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n**2. Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nCombine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) * k ) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe resulting potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two one-dimensional equations. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**4. Solve for the Energy Spectrum of Each 1D Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe general form for the energy eigenvalues of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 * K * q^2 is:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(K/m) and n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this as V_x(x) = 1/2 * K_x * x^2, where the effective spring constant is K_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2. The effective spring constant is K_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThis is the energy spectrum for the particle.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m). Comparing this with the given choices:\nA) E = (3n_x + 2n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (n_x + 3n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (2n_x + 3n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
