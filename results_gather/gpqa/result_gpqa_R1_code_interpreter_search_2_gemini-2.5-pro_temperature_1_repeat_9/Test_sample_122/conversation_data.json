    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the frames of reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame, making it the proper time (Δt₀).\n\n**2. State the given information:**\n*   Relative velocity (v) between the frames = 60,000 km/s.\n*   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s (time measured in the ejecta's frame).\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Determine the goal:**\n*   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame (d).\n\n**4. Reasoning and Calculation Steps:**\n*   **Step 1: Find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for events happening in a moving frame (the ejecta) than the observer in the moving frame. The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    where γ (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    First, find the ratio v/c:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The distance is the velocity of the ejecta (as measured in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    d = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s]\n\nNow, let's compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity of ejecta in km/s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in seconds\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy: 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), known as proper time (Δt₀): 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame, Δt) is related to the proper time (ejecta's frame, Δt₀) by the time dilation formula:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    where γ (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β = v/c):\n        β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we use the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n    *   Calculating the value: √(0.96) ≈ 0.9798\n    *   Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n    *   So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy is its velocity (in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (in the Galaxy's frame).\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )\n    *   d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\n    *   d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The python script executed the calculation `distance = 60000 * (1 / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)**2)) * 50`.\n    *   The output was `3061862`.\n    *   This value, 3,061,862 km, is closest to the option B, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\nAn alternative way to think about it:\n*   Without relativity (classical physics), the distance would be d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km (Option C).\n*   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame is *longer* than 50 seconds.\n*   Therefore, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options, only option B (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that B must be the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
