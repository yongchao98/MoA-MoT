This requires a chain of formulas:\n\n*   **Small Angle Approximation:** This formula relates the physical diameter of an object (D) to its angular size (θ) and distance (d). For a black hole, the relevant size is the diameter of its event horizon, which is twice the Schwarzschild radius (D = 2 * Rs).\n    `θ_rad ≈ D / d = (2 * Rs) / d`\n    *Note: The angular size `θ` must be in radians for this formula.*\n\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius (Rs):** This formula gives the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole of mass M.\n    `Rs = (2 * G * M) / c^2`\n    where G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (S):** This formula gives the entropy of a black hole.

    "The user has provided an updated code output, indicating a correction to the previous calculation. I will re-evaluate the problem based on this new, correct information.\n\n**1. Review of the Goal and Method**\n\nThe objective remains to find the order of magnitude for the entropy of a black hole, given its angular size and distance. The physical formulas and the step-by-step plan are correct:\n1.  Convert given values (distance `d`, angular size `θ`) to SI units.\n2.  Use the small angle approximation `Rs = (d * θ_rad) / 2` to find the Schwarzschild radius `Rs`.\n3.  Use the Schwarzschild radius formula `M = (Rs * c^2) / (2 * G)` to find the mass `M`.\n4.  Use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula `S = (4 * π * G * k_B * M^2) / (ħ * c)` to find the entropy `S`.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Corrected Calculation**\n\nThe provided code output is `Entropy (J/K): 1.2040e+62`.\n\nLet's verify this result step-by-step to ensure its accuracy.\n\n*   **Constants and Given Values:**\n    *   `d = 10^10` parsecs = `10^10 * 3.086e16` m = `3.086e26` m.\n    *   `θ = 10^-17` degrees = `10^-17 * (π / 180)` radians ≈ `1.745e-19` rad.\n    *   `G ≈ 6.67e-11` m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\n    *   `c ≈ 3e8` m/s\n    *   `k_B ≈ 1.38e-23` J/K\n    *   `ħ ≈ 1.05e-34` J·s\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate Schwarzschild Radius (`Rs`)**\n    `Rs = (d * θ_rad) / 2 = (3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad) / 2 ≈ 2.69e7` m.\n    This matches the intermediate values from the initial calculation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Mass (`M`)**\n    `M = (Rs * c^2) / (2 * G) = (2.69e7 * (3e8)^2) / (2 * 6.67e-11) ≈ 1.81e34` kg.\n    This also matches the intermediate values.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate Entropy (`S`)**\n    This is the crucial step. We will use the calculated mass `M = 1.81e34 kg`.\n    `S = (4 * π * G * k_B * M^2) / (ħ * c)`\n    `S = (4 * π * (6.67e-11) * (1.38e-23) * (1.81e34)^2) / ((1.05e-34) * (3e8))`\n    `S ≈ (1.157e-32 * 3.276e68) / (3.15e-26)`\n    `S ≈ (3.79e36) / (3.15e-26)`\n    `S ≈ 1.20 * 10^(36 - (-26)) = 1.20 * 10^62` J/K.\n\n**3.
