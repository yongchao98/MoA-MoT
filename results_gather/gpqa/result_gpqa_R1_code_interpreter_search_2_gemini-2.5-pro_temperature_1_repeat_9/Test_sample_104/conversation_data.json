    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem presents two scenarios that affect a star's measured brightness (photometry):\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with an uneven surface brightness (due to spots) will appear to change in brightness as it rotates. We will see the brightest side and the dimmest side, causing a periodic variation.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of a hypothetical planet that would cause a brightness dip of the same magnitude as the dip caused by the star's spots.\n\n**2. Model the Flux Variation due to Spots**\n\nWe can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy flux (F) radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T): `F ∝ T⁴`. The total luminosity is this flux multiplied by the surface area.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the observer sees the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk (with area A = πR_star²) radiates at the star's effective temperature, T_eff.\n    `F_max ∝ A * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the observer sees the hemisphere covered in spots. This hemisphere has a filling factor `f` of 0.20 (or 20%). This means 20% of the visible area is at the spot temperature (T_spot), and the remaining 80% (1 - f) is at the star's normal temperature (T_eff).\n    `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A * T_eff⁴] + [f * A * T_spot⁴]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot Signal**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the fractional change in flux, calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux.\n\nAmplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for F_max and F_min:\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - {([(1 - f) * A * T_eff⁴] + [f * A * T_spot⁴]) / (A * T_eff⁴)}\n\nThe area `A` cancels out:\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)]\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n**Amplitude_spot = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]**\n\n**4. Model the Signal from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks a portion of the star's disk. The resulting dip in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\nAmplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star\nAmplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n**Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\n**5. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius that would produce the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other and solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] )\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴] )\n\nWe can use a short Python script to compute this value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20        # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is equal to this amplitude: (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spot\n# Solve for the relative radius R_pl / R_star\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.3218\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet would be approximately 0.3218. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Flux from the Star**\n\nThe flux (brightness) from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law: F ∝ A * T⁴).\n\n**2. Calculate the Flux Variation due to Spots**\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we see the hemisphere with no spots. The entire visible disk has a temperature T_eff. So, `F_max ∝ A * T_eff⁴`, where A is the area of the stellar disk.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we see the hemisphere with spots.\n    *   A fraction `(1 - f)` of the area is at temperature `T_eff`.\n    *   A fraction `f` of the area is at the spot temperature `T_spot`.\n    *   So, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A * T_eff⁴ + f * A * T_spot⁴`.\n\n**3. Determine the Amplitude of the Spot Signal**\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the fractional change in flux:\nAmplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - [((1 - f) * A * T_eff⁴ + f * A * T_spot⁴) / (A * T_eff⁴)]\n\nThe area `A` cancels out:\nAmplitude_spot = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\nAmplitude_spot = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude_spot = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**4. Determine the Amplitude of the Planet Signal**\n\nWhen a planet transits, it blocks an area equal to its own cross-section (π * R_pl²). The dip in brightness (the signal amplitude) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nAmplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nAmplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**5. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet Radius**\n\nThe problem states that the signals have the same amplitude.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴])\n\n**6. Plug in the Given Values**\n\n*   Filling factor, f = 0.20\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴])\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])\n\nThe python code executed this calculation:\n```python\nimport math\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(0.20 * (1 - (5000.0/6000.0)**4))\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\nThe output was `0.3218`.\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Reasoning and Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks us to equate the amplitude of a brightness variation caused by stellar spots with the amplitude of a dip caused by a planetary transit.\n\n*   **Step 1: Model the brightness variation due to spots.**\n    The flux (F) from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ A * T⁴`, where A is the area and T is the temperature.\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This surface is a mix of normal temperature (`T_eff`) and spot temperature (`T_spot`). The filling factor `f` tells us that 20% of the area is covered by spots.\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The fractional amplitude of this signal is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n        `Amplitude_spot = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n        `Amplitude_spot = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n        `Amplitude_spot = 1 - (1 - f + f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n        `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Model the brightness dip due to a planet.**\n    A transiting planet blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to the ratio of their projected areas.\n    `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n*   **Step 3: Equate the amplitudes and solve.**\n    We are looking for the case where `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000/6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n\nThe Python code executed this exact calculation and returned the value `0.32179...`.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.322. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~0.32\n*   B) ~0.11\n*   C) ~0.39\n*   D) ~0.07\n\nThe value `0.322` is closest to `0.32`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
