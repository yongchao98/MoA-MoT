    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Starting material):** trans-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring (C₆H₅), 2 in the alkene chain (-CH=CH-), and 1 in the aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Total carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr).\n    *   This is a Grignard reagent and acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻). It contains 1 carbon atom.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The Grignard reagent performs a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The methyl group attacks the aldehyde's carbon, and after an aqueous workup (which is implied in such reactions), the carbonyl oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO + CH₃MgBr → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OMgBr)CH₃\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OMgBr)CH₃ + H₂O → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃ (Product 1)\n\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 1-phenyl-1-buten-3-ol.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃), which is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   **The Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃). This reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms; it only changes the functional group.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃). This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The number of carbon atoms remains the same as in Product 1.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂]. This is commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. It functions to add a methylene group (CH₂) to a molecule.\n*   **The Reaction:** When an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, the ylide performs a conjugate addition (or Michael addition) to the carbon-carbon double bond, followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond of Product 2.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The 10 carbons from Product 2 plus the 1 carbon from the methylene group (CH₂) of the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 3 = 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons (no change)\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
