    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source. The reaction is typically carried out under slightly acidic conditions. A strong acid, such as HCl or H₂SO₄, is used to provide the necessary protons (H⁺). H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) is the general representation for an aqueous acid. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, which is a different reaction. Therefore, A is H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction proceeds by the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options, we have CH₃COOH (a weak acid) and HCl (a strong acid). Complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires harsh conditions, such as heating with a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH). A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not sufficient to drive the reaction to completion efficiently. Therefore, HCl is the suitable reagent for B.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
