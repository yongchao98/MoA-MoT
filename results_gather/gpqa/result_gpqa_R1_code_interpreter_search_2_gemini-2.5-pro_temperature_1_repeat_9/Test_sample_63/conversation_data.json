    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent (desiccant), so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃ or CaSO₃) and change the mass of the tube.\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube did not change.\n    *   This means no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition of the salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   The gas that reacted must be O₂. The mass increase corresponds to the mass of this O₂.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n\n*   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 4.40 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n\n*   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nThe gas C is a substance that did not react with the contents of the tubes and has a molar mass of 28 g/mol. The most common gases with this molar mass are:\n*   Nitrogen (N₂): Molar mass ≈ 2 * 14.0 = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   Carbon monoxide (CO): Molar mass ≈ 12.0 + 16.0 = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nSince no CO₂ was produced (Tube №2 unchanged), it is highly unlikely that CO would be produced without it. Therefore, Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nThe initial salts A and B decomposed completely into H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N) atoms. Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of H atoms:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of N atoms:** from 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of O atoms:** from 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nLet's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the total mass of the mixture:\n*   Mass H = 0.40 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n*   Mass N = 0.20 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g\n*   Mass O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which are composed of H, N, and O. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\nThis means that the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B is 8 H, 4 N, and 5 O. Let's look for two common ammonium salts that add up to this combined formula (H₈N₄O₅).\n\n*   Ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃** (formula: H₄N₂O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂** (formula: H₄N₂O₂)\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(H₄N₂O₃) + (H₄N₂O₂) = H₈N₄O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salt A is NH₄NO₃ and salt B is NH₄NO₂ (or vice versa).\n\nWe can verify this by checking if their decomposition produces the correct amount of gases. The problem states the mixture is equimolar, and our calculation of the elemental ratio implies a 1:1 molar ratio. Let's find the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass of 1 mole of A + 1 mole of B = 80 + 64 = 144 g.\n*   Our total mass is 7.20 g.\n*   Moles of the (A+B) pair = 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   This means the mixture contained **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**.\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   A known, albeit less common, decomposition of ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.05/2) mol O₂ + (0.05*2) mol H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products from both reactions:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol** (Matches our finding)\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol** (Matches our finding)\n*   Total O₂ = 0 + 0.025 = **0.025 mol** (Matches our finding)\n\nThe hypothesis is fully consistent with all the data provided.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
