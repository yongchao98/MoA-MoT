    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture under Fraunhofer conditions is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity distribution is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\nwhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   J₁ is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   θ is the angle from the central axis.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator J₁(k * a * sinθ) is zero, provided the denominator is not zero. The zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are denoted by j_1,n for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, for the minima, we have:\nk * a * sin(θ_n) = j_1,n\nSubstituting k = 2π / λ:\n(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = j_1,n\n\nSolving for sin(θ_n):\nsin(θ_n) = (j_1,n * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ. Thus, the angular positions of the minima are:\nθ_n ≈ (j_1,n * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\nFrom standard tables or calculation:\n*   The first zero, j_1,1 ≈ 3.8317\n*   The second zero, j_1,2 ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (n=1):\n    θ₁ ≈ (j_1,1 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (n=2):\n    θ₂ ≈ (j_1,2 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value 0.5068 λ/a is closest to 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
