    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2 group). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option D, which has a secondary amide (-NH-).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring (around 1715-1730 cm-1). It is too high for a typical amide C=O (which usually appears at < 1700 cm-1, e.g., ~1650 cm-1). This strongly suggests an ester functional group and rules out option A (benzamide).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm means this -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, likely in an ester linkage (R-COO-**CH2**-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to hydrogen exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two sets by the two different substituents.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together and Evaluating the Options**\n    *   From the analysis, we have determined the following structural fragments:\n        1.  A primary amine (-NH2)\n        2.  An ethyl ester where the ethyl group is the alcohol part (-COOCH2CH3)\n        3.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Assembling these fragments gives a structure where an -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group are attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Let's check the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is an amide, not an ester (contradicts IR C=O at 1720 cm-1).\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. While it is an ester, the ethyl group is part of the acid portion. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group next to the C=O would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This contradicts the NMR data.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. This perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, a 1,4-disubstituted ring, and an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (-OCH2- at 4.5 ppm). The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, and the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, which is consistent with their chemical shifts.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine (contradicts IR and NMR H count for the N-H protons).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
