    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energies for the system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L', the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are described as \"spin-1/2 particles\", which means they are fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for these particles is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number 'n' (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number $m_s$ (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n\nThis implies that each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   We place the first two particles in the n=1 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   We place the next two particles in the n=2 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n### 4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n### 5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by moving a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n\nLet's find the next possible higher energy configuration.\n*   **Possibility A:** Move a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility B:** Move both particles from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the possibilities, the state with energy 18E is the next lowest energy level after 15E. Therefore, this is the second excited state.\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
