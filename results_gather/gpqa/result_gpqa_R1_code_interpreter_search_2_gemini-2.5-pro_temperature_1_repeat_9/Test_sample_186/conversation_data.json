    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO**\n\nThe first step is to determine the faintest star that ESPRESSO can detect under the specified conditions.\n*   **Instrument:** ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT). This is the 1-UT mode.\n*   **Detection Criterion:** Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) ≥ 10.\n*   **Exposure Time:** 1 hour.\n\nAccording to the official ESO documentation for ESPRESSO, the expected performance in 1-UT mode for a 1-hour exposure is an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 16.5.\nTherefore, a star is considered detectable if its apparent V magnitude is **m_V ≤ 16.5**.\n\n**2. Assess the Visibility of Each Star from Paranal Observatory**\n\nThe VLT is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. We need its latitude to determine which stars are observable.\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n\nA star is generally considered observable from a given latitude if it rises to a reasonable altitude above the horizon. A common rule of thumb is that a star is observable if its declination (DEC) is greater than the observatory's latitude minus 90 degrees.\n*   **Observable Declination Limit:** DEC > (24.6° - 90°) = -65.4°\n\nNow, let's check the declination of each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Declination ≈ -52.7°. Since -52.7° > -65.4°, Canopus is observable from Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Declination ≈ +89.3°. Since +89.3° > -65.4°, Polaris is technically above the declination limit. However, its maximum altitude at Paranal would be (90° - 24.6°) - 89.3° = -23.9°, which is well below the horizon. Polaris is a northern circumpolar star and is never visible from the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n*   **c), d), e), f):** These stars are located at Declination = 0°. Since 0° > -65.4°, they are all observable from Paranal.\n\n**3. Calculate the Apparent Magnitude (m_V) for Each Star**\n\nNow we need to find the apparent V magnitude for each observable star and compare it to the limiting magnitude of 16.5.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is approximately -0.74.\n    *   **Check Detectability:** -0.74 ≤ 16.5. Canopus is **detectable**.\n\nFor stars (c), (d), (e), and (f), we need to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the given absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula:\nm_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d)\nwhere d is in parsecs (pc). We are given M_V = 15 for all of them.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    *   m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15.0\n    *   **Check Detectability:** 15.0 ≤ 16.5. This star is **detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    *   m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) = 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.505\n    *   **Check Detectability:** 21.505 is not ≤ 16.5. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    *   m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.495\n    *   **Check Detectability:** 13.495 ≤ 16.5. This star is **detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    *   m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) = 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.495\n    *   **Check Detectability:** 18.495 is not ≤ 16.5. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**4. Count the Number of Detectable Stars**\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: Not detectable (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc (m_V = 15.0): **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc (m_V = 21.5): Not detectable\n*   e) Star at 5 pc (m_V = 13.5): **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc (m_V = 18.5): Not detectable\n\nIn total, there are 3 detectable stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
