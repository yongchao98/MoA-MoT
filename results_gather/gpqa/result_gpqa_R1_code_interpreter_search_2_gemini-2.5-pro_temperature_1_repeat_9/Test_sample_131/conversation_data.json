    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. This indicates a high degree of unsaturation, consistent with an aromatic ring. The general formula for a benzene derivative is CnH2n-6. For a tetramethylbenzene, C6H2(CH3)4, the formula is C10H14. For a diethylbenzene, C6H4(C2H5)2, the formula is C10H14. All options fit the molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   A singlet in the aromatic region means the protons on the ring are either chemically equivalent or have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   Since there are two signals, it means we have two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. As each of the tetramethylbenzene options has only one type of aromatic proton, these two signals must come from two different compounds.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio of these signals is consistent with a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, each contributing one aromatic signal of equal integration (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The signals are all singlets, which means the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to any other protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   This observation immediately rules out **1,4-diethylbenzene**, as its ethyl groups would produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-), not singlets.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the remaining candidate compounds:**\n\nWe are left with three tetramethylbenzene isomers. Let's analyze the symmetry and predict the number and ratio of signals for each.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integration 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integration 12H).\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** (integration 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a pair). They will produce **one singlet** (integration 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. It will produce **one singlet** (integration 3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. It will produce **one singlet** (integration 3H).\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent but chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane (an AA' system), which will appear as **one singlet** (integration 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integration 6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integration 6H).\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 6:6, which simplifies to 1:1).*\n\n**3. Combine the predictions to match the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two** aromatic singlets (1:1) and **three** aliphatic singlets (2:1:1).\n\n*   The two aromatic singlets confirm a mixture of two different tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n*   We need to find a pair of isomers whose aliphatic signals combine to give three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the pairs from the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives 2 aliphatic signals (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives 3 aliphatic signals (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this would give at least 4 signals (unless there is perfect overlap), which doesn't match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives **1 aliphatic signal (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives **2 aliphatic signals (6H, 6H)**.\n    *   Combined, this gives a total of **three** aliphatic signals. The integration ratio would be **12H : 6H : 6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give singlets for its alkyl groups.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives 1 aliphatic signal (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives 3 aliphatic signals (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this gives a total of four aliphatic signals with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair that fits the observed NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
