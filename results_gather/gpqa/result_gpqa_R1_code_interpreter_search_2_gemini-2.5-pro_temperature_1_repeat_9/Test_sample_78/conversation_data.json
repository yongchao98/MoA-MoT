    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product's structure from the provided NMR data.**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction is an isomerization, as the problem describes a rearrangement reaction, and we will confirm that the product's formula deduced from the NMR data is also C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 (1C)** is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The signals in the range **δ 126.9 - 144.1** correspond to sp² hybridized carbons, which include carbons from an aromatic ring and a C=C double bond. There are 2+1+2+1+1+1 = 8 carbons in this region. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so there are 2 additional vinylic carbons (C=C).\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 (1C)** and **δ 28.4 (1C)** are in the aliphatic region (sp³ carbons). These are likely methyl groups (CH₃). The chemical shift of ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring, and the shift of ~28 ppm is typical for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (a methyl ketone).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The total integration is 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 hydrogens. This confirms the molecular formula of the product is **C11H12O**, and the reaction is indeed an isomerization.\n    *   The signals at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** are a classic pattern for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.\n    *   The signal at **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** is a singlet, indicating a methyl group with no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (a tolyl group). Combined with the para-substitution pattern, this points to a **p-tolyl group**.\n    *   The signal at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** is another methyl singlet, consistent with a methyl ketone (**-C(=O)CH₃**).\n    *   The signals at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** are two doublets in the vinylic region. They are coupled to each other, indicating a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). This forms an α,β-unsaturated system with the ketone.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (p-tolyl group, a ketone, and a C=C double bond), we can assemble the structure of the product. The most plausible structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\n    Structure of the product:\n    `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data and the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and relate the product to the starting material options.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is carried out with **1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)**, which is a non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base. The conditions (high temperature) suggest a base-catalyzed rearrangement.\n*   **Transformation:** The starting materials are all epoxides (oxiranes). The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. This transformation is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide (an epoxide with an adjacent C=C double bond).\n*   **Connecting Product to Starting Material:** The product contains a **p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl group)**. A chemical reaction under these conditions will not create or rearrange substituents on the benzene ring. Therefore, the starting material must also contain this p-tolyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given options.**\n\nLet's examine the structure of each option:\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** \"Styryl\" implies a phenyl group (from styrene), not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a styryl group (phenyl), not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This molecule contains the required p-tolyl skeleton. This is the only plausible option.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the reaction mechanism for Option D.**\n\nThe structure of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This is a vinyl epoxide. The proton on the epoxide carbon adjacent to the double bond is allylic and thus acidic.\n1.  DABCO acts as a base and removes this acidic proton.\n2.  The resulting anion triggers the opening of the epoxide ring to form a dienolate intermediate: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)-O⁻`.\n3.  This intermediate is then protonated (tautomerizes) to form the final, stable α,β-unsaturated ketone product: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\nThis mechanism is a well-established chemical transformation and correctly links the starting material in option D to the product identified from the NMR spectra.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
