    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. This is a tri-substituted benzene ring. Let's analyze the positions and directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy)** at C1: A strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)** at C2: A weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at C3: A strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. This specific arrangement is often challenging to synthesize via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions because the directing effects of the groups can conflict or lead to mixtures of isomers. A high-yield synthesis requires careful control of regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that correctly installs these three groups in the desired 1,2,3 orientation with high yield.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3):** Adds a tert-butyl group.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Adds a nitro group.\n*   **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** Adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This is a key reaction as -SO3H can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later (desulfonation).\n*   **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** Reduces a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** Converts an amino group (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** Replaces a diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** Converts a hydroxyl group (-OH) to an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4):** Removes a sulfonic acid group.\n\nLet's analyze the initial steps of each option:\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene. The next step is reduction to aniline, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options A, B, and C:** All start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a plausible first step.\n    *   **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**\n\nNow let's analyze the second step in these options:\n\n*   **Option A & B (Step ii): Nitration of tert-butylbenzene.** The tert-butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to its large steric bulk, it strongly favors substitution at the para position. This means the major product would be p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The target molecule requires the key groups to be adjacent, which would necessitate starting with o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, the minor product. A synthesis that relies on a minor product is not \"high-yield\". Thus, this is not an ideal synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C (Step ii): Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene.** The tert-butyl group directs the incoming electrophile to the para position.\n    *   **tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n    This step is high-yield. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n\nLet's continue with the logical path established by Option C, as it employs a powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry.\n\n*   **Step iii (Option C): Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   We have a t-Bu group (o,p-director) at C4 and an -SO3H group (m-director) at C1.\n    *   The t-Bu group directs nitration to its ortho positions (C3 and C5).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs nitration to its meta positions (C3 and C5).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent). This means nitration will occur cleanly at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\n    *   **Product: 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** (Or 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid depending on numbering, the structure is what matters).\n    This three-step sequence (alkylation, blocking sulfonation, directed nitration) is a classic and high-yield method to obtain an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative. This strongly suggests that Option C is on the right track.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Remainder of Option C**\n\nLet's examine the rest of the steps in Option C, assuming the goal is to convert the groups to the final product. There seems to be a typo or an illogical step (vi, HNO3/H2SO4), and the sequence might not produce the exact target isomer without further steps. However, let's trace the plausible transformations of the functional groups based on the provided reagents. The nitro group introduced can be reduced to an amine, which can then be converted via a diazonium salt to a phenol, and finally to the ethoxy ether. The sulfonic acid group would be removed at an appropriate stage.\n\nThe key insight is that the initial strategy of using a sulfonic acid blocking group (steps i, ii, iii) is the only method among the choices that guarantees a high-yield regiocontrolled synthesis of the necessary ortho-disubstituted intermediate. The other options either rely on low-yield separations or involve chemically unfavorable reactions. Therefore, despite potential typos in the later steps, the fundamental strategy outlined in the beginning of Option C is the most chemically sound and appropriate for a high-yield synthesis of a complex molecule like the target.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence C employs the most effective strategy for producing the required substitution pattern in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution. While the option may contain typos in its later steps, its core strategy is superior to all other options.\n\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\nii) **SO3/H2SO4**: Blocks the para position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Directs nitration to the position ortho to the tert-butyl group.\nThese first three steps provide the crucial ortho-arrangement of the tert-butyl group and a nitrogen-containing functional group, which is essential for building the final product. The subsequent steps are functional group manipulations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
