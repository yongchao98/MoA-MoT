    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has a spin 1/2. Its magnetic moment is given by the vector operator `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the initial state is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS · (B * ẑ) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). The energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   To minimize the energy `E`, we need `-γB * S_z` to be as negative as possible. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, this occurs when `S_z` has its maximum eigenvalue, `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis, which we denote as `|+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1], [0]]` and `|-z> = [[0], [1]]`, this is our starting vector.\n\n2.  **Analyze the New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS · (B * ŷ) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H`, we get `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB * S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBt * S_y / ħ)`.\n    *   This is the operator for a rotation around the y-axis.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Evolved State `|ψ(t)>`:**\n    *   To calculate the action of the exponential operator, we use the matrix representation of the spin operator `S_y`. For a spin-1/2 particle, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The evolution operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iγBt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   Let's define an angle `θ = γBt/2`. The operator is `U(t) = exp(iθσ_y)`.\n    *   We use the general formula for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: `exp(iθσ_k) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_k*sin(θ)`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    *   `U(t) = I*cos(θ) + iσ_y*sin(θ) = [[cos(θ), 0], [0, cos(θ)]] + i*[[0, -i], [i, 0]]*sin(θ)`\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(θ), 0], [0, cos(θ)]] + [[0, sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), 0]] = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]]`.\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]]`:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|+z> = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(θ)], [-sin(θ)]]`.\n    *   In Dirac notation, this is `|ψ(t)> = cos(θ)|+z> - sin(θ)|-z>`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`.\n    *   First, let's calculate `<S_z(t)>`. The operator `S_z` is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = ([cos(θ), -sin(θ)]) * ( (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] ) * ([[cos(θ)], [-sin(θ)]])`\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * ([cos(θ), -sin(θ)]) * ([[cos(θ)], [sin(θ)]])`\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(θ) - sin²(θ))`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2θ)`.\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   Now, substitute back `θ = γBt/2`:\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This equation describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt + φ)`. By comparing this with our result, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function, which is `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The projection of the precessing spin onto the Z-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\nComparing our result `γB` with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
