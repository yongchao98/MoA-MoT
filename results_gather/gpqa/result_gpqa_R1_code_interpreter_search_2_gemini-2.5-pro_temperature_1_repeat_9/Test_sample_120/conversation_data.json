    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**: This describes a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The `bicyclo[4.1.0]` part indicates a six-membered ring fused to a three-membered ring. The `7-oxa` specifies that atom 7, which bridges carbons 1 and 6, is an oxygen atom. This is the structure of cyclohexene oxide.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl**: Methyl groups are attached to carbons C1, C3, and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S)**: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, and C6).\n\n### 2. Understanding the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagents**: The epoxide is reacted with **Me₂CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The nucleophile is effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Key Principles (as stated in the question)**:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism). The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O epoxide bond.\n\n### 3. Applying the Reaction Principles\n\n1.  **Identify the site of attack**: The epoxide ring is between C1 and C6. We must determine which carbon is less sterically hindered.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached to it.\n    *   C6 has only hydrogen atoms attached (in addition to the ring carbons).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Determine the outcome of the attack**:\n    *   A new bond forms between the incoming methyl group and C6.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n    *   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (which is implicit in such reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their absolute spatial configuration is **retained**.\n    *   The stereocenter at C1 is also not inverted, as the attack is not at this carbon. Its substituents change (epoxide oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group), but its tetrahedral geometry is maintained.\n    *   The stereocenter at C6 is **inverted** due to the Sₙ2 attack.\n\n### 4. Determining the Structure and Name of the Product\n\n*   **Connectivity**: The product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n    *   At C1 (original numbering): an -OH group and a methyl group.\n    *   At C3 (original numbering): a methyl group.\n    *   At C4 (original numbering): a methyl group.\n    *   At C6 (original numbering): a new methyl group.\n*   **IUPAC Naming**: To name the product, we must renumber the ring according to IUPAC rules for substituted cyclohexanols.\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**. So, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Path A (numbering clockwise from new C1): C1(OH) -> C2(orig) -> C3(orig) -> C4(orig) -> C5(orig) -> C6(orig). The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on C1), 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1,3,4,6}.\n    *   Path B (numbering counter-clockwise from new C1): C1(OH) -> C6(orig) -> C5(orig) -> C4(orig) -> C3(orig) -> C2(orig). The methyl groups are at positions 1 (on C1), 2 (on orig C6), 4 (on orig C4), and 5 (on orig C3). The locant set is {1,2,4,5}.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets {1,3,4,6} and {1,2,4,5}, the latter is lower at the first point of difference. So, Path B is the correct numbering scheme.\n*   **Product Name**: The product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### 5. Determining the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\nWe need to find the absolute configuration (R/S) of the stereocenters in the product: new C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n\n*   **Mapping of Carbons**:\n    *   New C1 = Original C1\n    *   New C2 = Original C6\n    *   New C4 = Original C4\n    *   New C5 = Original C3\n\n*   **Configuration Analysis**:\n    *   **New C2**: This center comes from original C6, which had an **(S)** configuration. The reaction causes inversion. Therefore, the new C2 will have an **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **New C5**: This center comes from original C3, which had an **(R)** configuration. This center is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups do not change in a way that would flip the designation. So, the new C5 remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4**: This center comes from original C4, which had an **(R)** configuration. Its configuration is also retained. The CIP priorities of its neighboring ring carbons (C3 vs C5) do not change their relative order. So, the new C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C1**: This center comes from original C1, which had an **(R)** configuration. Its configuration is retained. While the substituents change (epoxide oxygen to -OH, and C6 to C6-with-a-new-methyl), the CIP priority order of the four attached groups remains consistent. So, the new C1 remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product Stereochemistry**: Combining these results, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
