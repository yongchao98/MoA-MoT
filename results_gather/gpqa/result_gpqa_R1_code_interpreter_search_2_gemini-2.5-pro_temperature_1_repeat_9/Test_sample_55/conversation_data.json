    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and States**\n    *   The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (the 1s state).\n    *   A direct transition |3,0,0> → |1,0,0> is a single-photon process. However, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` is Δl = ±1. Here, Δl = 0 - 0 = 0, so this direct transition is forbidden by the electric dipole selection rules.\n    *   The problem states the decay occurs \"via two dipole transition\". This implies a cascade decay, where the atom decays through an intermediate state in two steps, with each step being an electric dipole transition.\n    *   Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'>.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    *   **First transition:** |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>\n        *   Selection rule Δl = ±1: Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   Selection rule Δm = 0, ±1: Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay process, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number n' must be less than n=3. The possible values are n'=2 or n'=1. However, l' must be less than n', so for l'=1, n' must be at least 2. Thus, the lowest possible n' is 2. The most probable cascade decay occurs through the intermediate state with the largest transition probability, which is typically the one closest in energy. Therefore, the intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (the 2p state).\n    *   **Second transition:** |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>\n        *   Selection rule Δl = ±1: The initial state has l'=1 and the final state has l''=0. Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Selection rule Δm = 0, ±1: The initial state has m' and the final state has m''=0. Δm = 0 - m'. This is allowed for m' = 0, ±1.\n    *   So, all three possible intermediate states, |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, are valid pathways. The decay cascade is 3s → 2p → 1s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) is the only dipole-allowed decay path from the 2p state, so its probability is essentially 1.\n    *   We need to find the probability of the transition |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> for each possible m' (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   The transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: W ∝ |<f| **r** |i>|^2.\n    *   The total rate from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is proportional to Σ_{polarizations} |<f| **ε** ⋅ **r** |i>|^2, which simplifies to |<f|x|i>|^2 + |<f|y|i>|² + |<f|z|i>|^2.\n    *   The initial state |i> = |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). The interaction Hamiltonian for spontaneous emission must respect this symmetry. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the system should decay into each of the degenerate final substates |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> with equal probability.\n    *   Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to the radial integral squared (which is the same for all three m' values) and the angular part squared.\n        *   Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) ∝ |<2,1,m'|x|3,0,0>|^2 + |<2,1,m'|y|3,0,0>|^2 + |<2,1,m'|z|3,0,0>|^2.\n        *   Using the properties of spherical harmonics and the position operator components (x, y, z), we can evaluate the angular integrals.\n            *   For m'=0: The matrix elements for x and y are zero. Only the z-component is non-zero. Rate(|2,1,0>) ∝ |<z>|^2.\n            *   For m'=±1: The matrix element for z is zero. The x and y components are non-zero. Rate(|2,1,±1>) ∝ |<x>|^2 + |<y>|^2.\n        *   A detailed calculation using Wigner-Eckart theorem or direct integration of spherical harmonics shows that the total contribution from the angular parts is the same for all three final states m' = -1, 0, 1.\n        *   Let Rate(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = R_m'.\n        *   The calculation shows R_{-1} = R_{0} = R_{1}.\n    *   Since the rates are equal, the probabilities must be equal. The total probability of transitioning to the 2p manifold is the sum of the probabilities for each path. Assuming this is the only decay channel considered, the sum of probabilities is 1.\n        *   P(m'=-1) + P(m'=0) + P(m'=1) = 1\n        *   Since P(m'=-1) = P(m'=0) = P(m'=1), each probability must be 1/3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   The probability of the specific route |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0> is the probability of the first step, which is 1/3 for any m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability. The probability is 1/3.\n        *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n        *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n        *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. Incorrect probability. The probability is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
