Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it's highly relativistic. This means we must account for time dilation and the corresponding increase in its decay length in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying depends on its mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. This minimum length is the resolution of the detector. We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than or equal to `d`.\n\n**2. Calculations**\n\n*   **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:**\n    First, we find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which relates the particle's energy in the lab frame ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    Next, we need the particle's momentum, $p$. We can find it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):**\n    The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the mean lifetime is dilated to $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The mean distance the particle travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($L$), is its velocity ($v$) times its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n    $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    Since $p = \\gamma m v$, we can write $v = p/(\\gamma m)$.\n    $L = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m} (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$\n    Now, we can plug in the values (using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d$):**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n    We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we need to find the resolution `d` such that $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$.\n    The limiting case gives us the required resolution:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times L = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This calculated value is not one of the options. This often happens in physics problems when the intended question has a slight typo. Let's check what percentage corresponds to the closest answer, option C.\n    If $d = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the probability of observation is:\n    $P = e^{-d/L} = e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} = e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.332$\n    This is a probability of 33.2%. It is very likely the question intended to ask for a resolution to see at least 1/3 (or 33.3%) of the decays, which is very close to 30%. Let's calculate the resolution for observing 1/3 of the decays:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 1/3$\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n    $d = L \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This value, $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option C. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding of the given constants.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the calculation, the resolution needed to observe approximately 1/3 of the decays is about $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum resolution required.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: This is the lifetime of the particle $X^0$ in its own rest frame, given as $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the bubble chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime will appear longer to an observer in the lab. This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by the formula $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This factor depends on the particle's energy and mass. It's calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2}$, where E is the total energy and $m c^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n*   **Decay Length (L)**: This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. For highly relativistic particles, this distance is approximately $L \\approx c \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Exponential Decay**: The number of particles that survive after traveling a distance $x$ follows an exponential decay law, $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L}$. To observe a decay, the particle's track must be at least as long as the detector's resolution ($x_{res}$). The fraction of decays that can be observed is therefore the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than or equal to $x_{res}$, which is $e^{-x_{res}/L}$.\n\n### 2. State the Given Values\n\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass energy, $m_{X^0}c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_{X^0}c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L)**\nThe mean decay length is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame. We use the approximation $v \\approx c$ since the particle is highly relativistic ($\\gamma \\gg 1$).\n$L \\approx c \\gamma \\tau_0$\n$L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (7.9179) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 1.9003 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required resolution ($x_{res}$)**\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles traveling a distance greater than the resolution $x_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\nFraction observed = $e^{-x_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution, which in this context means the largest possible resolution value that still satisfies the condition. The options provided suggest that the intended fraction was likely $1/3$ rather than $30\\%$, as this is common in such problems to yield a cleaner result. Let's proceed by setting the fraction of observed decays to $1/3$.\n\n$e^{-x_{res}/L} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nTo solve for $x_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$- \\frac{x_{res}}{L} = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n$x_{res} = L \\ln(3)$\n\nNow, we substitute the values for L and $\\ln(3)$:\n$x_{res} \\approx (1.9003 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986)$\n$x_{res} \\approx 2.0878 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result is extremely close to one of the given options.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated required resolution is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Physics Problem:** The question asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of particle decays. The most characteristic length scale for a decaying particle is its mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($L$). Let's calculate this length and then check if it satisfies the condition. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the mean decay length $L$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law, $P(x > L) = e^{-L/L} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is \"at least 30%\", the mean decay length is a reasonable value for the required resolution.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$): $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Rest mass energy ($mc^2$): $3.41$ GeV\n    *   Energy in the Bubble Chamber: $27$ GeV. This is often ambiguous. It could be total energy or kinetic energy. Let's assume it's the kinetic energy (KE), as this is common in such problems, and we will see it leads to an answer that matches one of the options.\n    *   Speed of light (c): $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy.\n    $E_{total} = KE + mc^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate Relativistic Momentum ($p$):** We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E_{total}^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    We can solve for the momentum term, $pc$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):** The mean decay length in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying. It is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime in the lab frame. A more direct formula using the quantities we have is:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** Substitute the known values into the formula to find the length $L$ in meters and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given constants\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nm_c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\nE_kin = 27.0  # Kinetic energy in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total energy\n# We assume the 27 GeV is kinetic energy, as this leads to one of the options.\nE_total = E_kin + m_c2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the relativistic momentum term (pc)\n# From the relation E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc = math.sqrt(E_total**2 - m_c2**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame\n# L = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau_0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m_c2) * c * tau_0\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay length is: {mean_decay_length:.2e} m\")\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(f\"A) 2.08e-3 m\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.08e-6 m\")\nprint(f\"C) 2.08e-9 m\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.08e-1 m\")\n\n# The calculated value of 2.13e-6 m is closest to option B.\n# The small discrepancy is likely due to the precise values of constants used when creating the problem.\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated mean decay length is: 2.13e-06 m\nThe given options are:\nA) 2.08e-3 m\nB) 2.08e-6 m\nC) 2.08e-9 m\nD) 2.08e-1 m\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. This resolution is a measure of distance (track length).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the average lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber): $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV. (We use $c=1$ for convenience in intermediate steps, so $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV).\n    *   Condition: Observe at least 30% of decays.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Calculations:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime and the distance it travels will be affected by time dilation and length contraction from the lab's perspective.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass.\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer than the proper lifetime.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{lab}$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n    $L_{lab} = v \\times \\tau_{lab}$\n    To find the velocity $v$, we can use the relativistic momentum. First, find the momentum $p$:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    Now, we can find the velocity factor $\\beta = v/c$ using the momentum:\n    $pc = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c) c = \\gamma \\beta (m_0 c^2)$\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.854$\n\n    The mean decay length is:\n    $L_{lab} = (\\beta\\gamma) \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    $L_{lab} = 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Interpret the \"Observe 30% of Decays\" Condition:**\n    The phrasing \"minimum resolution\" is slightly ambiguous. Let's analyze the most plausible physical interpretations.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The resolution is the characteristic distance by which 30% of particles have decayed. This is not a standard definition of resolution.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** A decay is \"observed\" if its track length is greater than the detector's resolution, $R$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $R$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > R) = e^{-R/L_{lab}}$. We want this fraction to be at least 30% ($0.3$).\n        $e^{-R/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.3$\n        This gives an upper limit on the resolution: $R \\le -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3) \\approx 1.204 \\times L_{lab}$.\n    *   **Interpretation C (most likely intended):** The question is asking for a characteristic length scale of the decay process. The most important one is the mean decay length, $L_{lab}$. Let's check if a resolution equal to $L_{lab}$ satisfies the condition. If $R = L_{lab}$, the fraction of observed decays is $e^{-L_{lab}/L_{lab}} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is greater than 30%, the mean decay length is a valid resolution that meets the criteria.\n\n6.  **Compare Calculation with Options:**\n    Our calculated mean decay length is $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    Our calculated value ($1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The difference is about 10%.\n\n7.  **Reconcile the Discrepancy:**\n    This 10% difference strongly suggests a typo in the problem's given values, which is common in textbook problems. Let's assume the answer D is correct and see what input value would produce it. If we assume the intended answer is $L_{lab} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, this would require the particle's rest mass to be $m_0 \\approx 3.095$ GeV. This mass is extremely close to the known mass of the J/ψ meson (3.0969 GeV), a particle commonly studied in high-energy physics. It is highly probable that the problem was intended to be about a J/ψ meson, but its mass was incorrectly stated as 3.41 GeV.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is asking for the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame. The calculation using the provided numbers yields a result very close to option D. The small discrepancy is almost certainly due to a typo in the particle's mass in the problem statement. Therefore, the intended answer is the one closest to our calculated value.\n\n*   Calculated Mean Decay Length: $L_{lab} \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   Closest Option: D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. To solve this, we need to relate the detector resolution to the decay properties of the relativistic particle.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Decay Law and Observation Condition**\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying in the laboratory frame is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nFor a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution, which we'll call $d$. Therefore, the condition to observe at least 30% of the decays is:\n$P(\\text{distance} > d) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary case. It is common in such physics problems that a percentage like 30% is an approximation for a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that it represents $1/3 \\approx 0.33$. This would mean we want to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays. The boundary condition becomes:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle is relativistic, so its lifetime and decay length are affected by its speed. The mean decay length in the lab frame ($\\lambda$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$ is the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\nUsing particle physics units where energy and mass are in GeV, this simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nA convenient formula for the mean decay length that combines these factors is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41$\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{27}{3.41}\\right)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$\\lambda \\approx (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (7.854) \\approx 1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nNow, calculate the required resolution $d$:\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3) \\approx (1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n$d \\approx 2.069 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result was confirmed by the provided Python code execution, which gave $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### **4.

This requires a few steps based on the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, relates the energy of a particle to its rest mass and is a measure of the relativistic effects. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (m₀c²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Rest mass (m₀) = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.918\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime (τ₀) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber), the particle's lifetime (τ) is dilated due to its high speed, a phenomenon known as time dilation. The observed lifetime is τ = γτ₀.\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity (v) is very close to the speed of light (c). The decay length can be calculated more precisely using the formula L = c * τ₀ * √(γ² - 1).\n\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime (τ₀) = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Lorentz factor (γ) ≈ 7.918\n\nL = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) * √(7.918² - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * √(62.69 - 1)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * √(61.69)\nL ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * 7.854\nL ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Minimum Resolution (d)\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The probability that a particle survives to travel at least a distance `d` follows an exponential decay law: P(l ≥ d) = e^(-d/L).\n\nWe are given that this probability must be at least 30%:\ne^(-d/L) = 0.30\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-d/L = ln(0.30)\nd = -L * ln(0.30)\nd ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\nd ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ meters.

The slight numerical difference may be due to rounding of constants or a minor inaccuracy in the problem statement's values. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the energy and mass of a relativistic particle. It is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m₀c²). In particle physics units where c=1, this simplifies to the ratio of energy to mass.\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame (τ):** Due to time dilation, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime (τ₀).\n    *   Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Lab frame lifetime τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity (v) is very close to the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   L = v * τ ≈ c * τ\n    *   L = (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the required resolution (d):** The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance 'x' or more before decaying is given by P(x) = e^(-x/L). To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, 'd'. The problem requires observing at least 30% of the decays.\n    *   P(x > d) ≥ 0.30\n    *   e^(-d/L) ≥ 0.30\n\n    To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition, which represents the largest distance (i.e., the worst or \"minimum\" resolution) that still satisfies the requirement.\n    *   e^(-d/L) = 0.30\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -d/L = ln(0.30)\n    *   d = -L * ln(0.30)\n    *   d ≈ -(1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n    *   d ≈ 2.288 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value for the resolution is approximately 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m. This value is closest to option D. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values. With a resolution of 2.08*1e-6 m, one would be able to observe `exp(-2.08e-6 / 1.90e-6) ≈ 33.5%` of the decays, which satisfies the \"at least 30%\" condition.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. This means we need to find the minimum distance, $d$, that the particle travels such that the probability of it traveling at least this distance before decaying is 30%.\n\n**1. Calculate Relativistic Parameters**\n\nFirst, we determine the particle's Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) from its total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m_0$).\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.91789$\n\nNext, we find the particle's velocity, $v$, as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(7.91789)^2}} \\approx 0.99199$\nThe velocity is $v = \\beta c$.\n\n**2. Apply Time Dilation and Decay Law**\n\nThe particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated from its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n*   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Lab Lifetime, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.91789 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\nThe decay of particles is a random process described by an exponential probability distribution. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$. We want to find the time $t_{30\\%}$ for which the survival probability is 30% (or 0.3).\n\n$P(t_{30\\%}) = e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau} = 0.3$\n\nTo solve for $t_{30\\%}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau}) = \\ln(0.3)$\n$-\\frac{t_{30\\%}}{\\tau} = \\ln(0.3)$\n$t_{30\\%} = -\\tau \\ln(0.3)$\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Distance (Resolution)**\n\nThe minimum resolution required is the distance $d$ that the particle travels in the time $t_{30\\%}$.\n$d = v \\times t_{30\\%} = (\\beta c) \\times (-\\tau \\ln(0.3))$\n\nSubstituting $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$:\n$d = -(\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0) \\ln(0.3)$\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n*   $\\beta \\approx 0.99199$\n*   $c = 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.91789$\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.204$\n\n$d \\approx -(0.99199 \\times 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (7.91789 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d \\approx (2.974 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\times (1.204)$\n$d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated distance is the minimum track length the detector must be able to resolve.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The order of magnitude is correct, and the numerical value is the closest match.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays. In this context, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the decay point from the creation point. This is only possible if the particle travels a distance, $x$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, we need to find the resolution $d$ such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $x > d$ is at least 30%.\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles that survive (do not decay) after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $$ \\frac{N(x)}{N_0} = e^{-x/L} $$\n    where $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference. The fraction of particles that we can observe is the fraction that travels a distance greater than the resolution $d$. We set this fraction to 30% (or 0.3):\n    $$ P(x > d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.3 $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):** To find $d$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n    $$ -\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.3) $$\n    $$ d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) $$\n    To calculate $d$, we first need to find the mean decay length, $L$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The particle is relativistic, so we must use concepts from Special Relativity. The total energy ($E$) of the particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $$ E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 $$\n    Given the energy and mass in units of GeV, we can directly calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $$ \\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 $$\n    The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $L$, which is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime.\n    $$ L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 $$\n    For a highly relativistic particle, the velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. A more precise formula for the mean decay length is $L = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Let's calculate the numerical values.\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$.\n\n    First, calculate the mean decay length $L$:\n    $$ L = \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) $$\n    $$ L \\approx \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) $$\n    $$ L \\approx 7.854 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\n    Now, calculate the required resolution $d$:\n    $$ d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) $$\n    $$ d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value for the resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given choices:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is very close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem. Option D is the only one that has the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector must have to observe a specific fraction of particle decays. The particle is highly relativistic, so we must apply the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) that is significantly greater than its rest mass ($m_0 = 3.41$ GeV). This indicates that the particle is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light ($c$), and we must account for relativistic effects like time dilation.\n\n2.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor connects the total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m_0$) of a particle through the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Using the given units (GeV for energy and GeV/c² for mass), this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle's lifetime is dilated to $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The average distance it travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. A more direct formula for $\\lambda$ is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    This formula incorporates both time dilation and the particle's velocity.\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles ($F$) that travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by:\n    $F = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\n5.  **Condition for Observation:** The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. This gives us the inequality:\n    $F_{obs} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n6.  **Solving for Resolution:** To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. This will give us the largest possible value for $d_{res}$ (i.e., the coarsest resolution) that still satisfies the condition.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n### 2.

We first need to find the momentum term $pc$ using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    \n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n    \n    Now, we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    \n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution ($L$):**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ greater than the resolution $L$ follows the exponential decay law: $P(d > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n    We are given that at least 30% of the decays must be observed, so $P(d > L) \\ge 0.30$.\n    \n    To find the threshold resolution, we solve for the equality:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    \n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    \n    $L = -\\lambda \\times (-1.204) = 1.204 \\times \\lambda$\n    $L \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Code Verification:**\n    The provided Python code performs this calculation with higher precision:\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    E = 27.0\n    m0c2 = 3.41\n    tau0 = 8e-16\n    c = 299792458.0\n    pc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n    mean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n    L = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.3)\n    # L = 2.2680e-06 m\n    ```\n    The code output confirms our calculation: $L \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated required resolution is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is the largest possible resolution that allows observing at least 30% of the decays. Any resolution smaller than this value will also satisfy the condition.\n    Let's look at the options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    Option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the closest value to our calculated result. Since $2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} < 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$, a detector with this resolution would be able to observe slightly more than 30% of the decays, thus satisfying the condition \"at least 30%\". The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum resolution required.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   A particle (X⁰) moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference (the bubble chamber) than its own rest frame. This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance this particle travels before decaying is called the decay length.\n    *   The decay of individual particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives for a certain distance follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be longer than the detector's spatial resolution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m₀).\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (<L>):**\n    The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying (<L>) depends on its proper lifetime (τ₀), its velocity (v), and the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is <L> = γ * v * τ₀. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. A more precise formula uses the particle's momentum `p`: <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀.\n    *   First, find the momentum `p`: p = √(E² - m₀²) = √(27² - 3.41²) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay length:\n        <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀\n        <L> = (26.78 GeV/c / 3.41 GeV/c²) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        <L> ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n        <L> ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution:**\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of a particle having a decay length (`l`) greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`) must be at least 0.30.\n    *   P(l > d_res) ≥ 0.30\n    The probability of a particle surviving beyond a distance `d` is given by the exponential decay law: P(l > d) = exp(-d / <L>).\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible value for `d_res` that satisfies this condition:\n        exp(-d_res / <L>) = 0.30\n    *   Solving for `d_res`:\n        -d_res / <L> = ln(0.30)\n        d_res = -<L> * ln(0.30)\n        d_res ≈ -(1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n        d_res ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculation shows that the resolution must be less than or equal to 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m to observe at least 30% of the decays. We now check which of the given options satisfy this condition.\n    *   A) 2.08 * 10⁻⁶ m: This is ≤ 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is sufficient.\n    *   B) 2.08 * 10⁻³ m: This is > 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is not sufficient.\n    *   C) 2.08 * 10⁻⁹ m: This is ≤ 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is sufficient.\n    *   D) 2.08 * 10⁻¹ m: This is > 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. This resolution is not sufficient.\n\n    Both options A and C are technically correct. However, the question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is typically interpreted as the least stringent requirement, or the largest value for the resolution that still works. Option A is much closer to the calculated threshold of 2.27 * 10⁻⁶ m. The small discrepancy between the calculated value and option A is likely due to a slight inaccuracy in the problem's given values. Therefore, option A is the most reasonable answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $ X^{0} $, we must first calculate the particle's average decay length in the laboratory frame of reference. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($ \\gamma $)\nThe Lorentz factor describes the time dilation effect for a moving particle. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($ mc^2 $). In particle physics, mass is often given in units of GeV/$ c^2 $, so the factor can be calculated directly from the given energy and mass values.\n*   Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Mass (m) = 3.41 GeV/$ c^2 $\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918 $\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime ($ \\tau_{0} $) of the particle is its lifetime in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame, this lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, a phenomenon known as time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame ($ \\tau $) is $ \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_{0} $.\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity is very close to the speed of light (c).\n*   Proper lifetime ($ \\tau_{0} $) = $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s\n*   Speed of light (c) $ \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 $ m/s\n\nThe mean decay length is calculated as:\n$ L = c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{0} $\n$ L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (7.918) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) $\n$ L \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\n\n### 3. Determining the Required Resolution\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be distinguishable from its point of creation. This means the particle must travel a distance ($ d $) greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($ x_{res} $).\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $ x_{res} $ before decaying is given by $ P(d > x_{res}) = e^{-x_{res}/L} $.\n\nThe problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Therefore, the resolution must be such that:\n$ P(d > x_{res}) \\ge 0.30 $\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30 $\n\nTo find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies this condition (which corresponds to the \"minimum\" or coarsest acceptable resolution), we solve for the equality:\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} = 0.30 $\n$ -\\frac{x_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\n\nThis result ($ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m) represents the largest resolution that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any resolution smaller than this value would observe a higher percentage of decays.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value of $ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m is closest to option C, $ 2.08 \\times 10^{-6} $ m. The small discrepancy (approximately 10%) is likely due to a slight imprecision in the values provided in the problem statement. For instance, if the proper lifetime were $ 7.25 \\times 10^{-16} $ s instead of $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s, the calculated resolution would be approximately $ 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} $ m, which matches option C almost perfectly. Given the choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   Total energy E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV/c², which means the rest energy $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The distance it travels is its speed multiplied by this dilated lifetime. For highly relativistic particles, the speed is very close to the speed of light (c).\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The mean decay length is $L \\approx c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n        $L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum resolution**: The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $\\Delta x$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $\\Delta x$ before decaying is given by $e^{-\\Delta x / L}$.\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we set this fraction to 0.30.\n    *   $e^{-\\Delta x / L} = 0.30$\n    *   To solve for $\\Delta x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1.204 \\times L$\n    *   $\\Delta x \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Select the closest answer**: The calculated value is approximately $2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰. In particle physics, a decay is \"observed\" if the particle leaves a track of a certain length before it decays. This track length must be greater than the detector's resolution.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it is highly relativistic. This means we must account for time dilation.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law: `P(distance ≥ x) = e^(-x/λ)`, where `λ` is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** We need to find the resolution, `d`, such that the probability of the track length being greater than `d` is at least 30%. This gives the inequality: `e^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n*   E = 27 GeV\n*   m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n*   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It is related to the proper lifetime (τ₀), the speed of light (c), and the Lorentz factor (γ).\n*   τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\nA precise formula for the mean decay length is `λ = c * τ₀ * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n*   λ = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) * sqrt(7.918² - 1)\n*   λ ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * sqrt(62.69 - 1)\n*   λ ≈ (2.4 × 10⁻⁷ m) * 7.854\n*   λ ≈ 1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (d)**\nWe need to find the resolution `d` that satisfies `e^(-d/λ) ≥ 0.30`. This inequality sets an upper limit on `d`. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed,\" which in this context is typically interpreted as the coarsest (largest) resolution that still meets the criterion. We solve for the boundary condition:\n*   e^(-d/λ) = 0.30\n*   -d/λ = ln(0.30)\n*   d = -λ * ln(0.30) ≈ - (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n*   d ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis result means any resolution `d ≤ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m` will work.\n\n### **4. Compare with Options and Refine**\nThe calculated threshold is `2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m`. Let's examine the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nOption C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is less than our calculated threshold, so it is a valid resolution. It is also the closest value.\n\nFurthermore, it is very common in such problems for percentages like \"30%\" to be an approximation for a simple fraction that yields a cleaner answer. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended fraction was 1/3 (≈33.3%).\n*   e^(-d/λ) = 1/3\n*   -d/λ = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n*   d = λ * ln(3) ≈ (1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.0986\n*   d ≈ 2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nThis value, `2.071 × 10⁻⁶ m`, is extremely close to option C, `2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m`. The minor difference (less than 0.5%) can be attributed to the rounding of the given physical constants. This confirms that C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), so it's highly relativistic. This means we must account for time dilation and the corresponding increase in its decay length in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a certain distance before decaying depends on its mean decay length.\n*   **Detector Resolution:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must leave a track of a certain minimum length before it decays. This minimum length is the resolution of the detector. We need to find the resolution `d` such that at least 30% of the particles travel a distance greater than or equal to `d`.\n\n**2. Calculations**\n\n*   **Calculate Relativistic Parameters:**\n    First, we find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which relates the particle's energy in the lab frame ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    Next, we need the particle's momentum, $p$. We can find it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):**\n    The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the mean lifetime is dilated to $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The mean distance the particle travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($L$), is its velocity ($v$) times its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n    $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    Since $p = \\gamma m v$, we can write $v = p/(\\gamma m)$.\n    $L = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m} (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\frac{p}{m} \\tau_0$\n    Now, we can plug in the values (using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s):\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Required Resolution ($d$):**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n    We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we need to find the resolution `d` such that $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$.\n    The limiting case gives us the required resolution:\n    $e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times L = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    This calculated value is not one of the options. This often happens in physics problems when the intended question has a slight typo. Let's check what percentage corresponds to the closest answer, option C.\n    If $d = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the probability of observation is:\n    $P = e^{-d/L} = e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.885 \\times 10^{-6})} = e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.332$\n    This is a probability of 33.2%.

To observe a decay, the particle's track must be at least as long as the detector's resolution ($x_{res}$). The fraction of decays that can be observed is therefore the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than or equal to $x_{res}$, which is $e^{-x_{res}/L}$.\n\n### 2.

This is the average lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber): $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV. (We use $c=1$ for convenience in intermediate steps, so $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV).\n    *   Condition: Observe at least 30% of decays.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Calculations:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime and the distance it travels will be affected by time dilation and length contraction from the lab's perspective.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy and rest mass.\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer than the proper lifetime.\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{lab}$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n    $L_{lab} = v \\times \\tau_{lab}$\n    To find the velocity $v$, we can use the relativistic momentum. First, find the momentum $p$:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    Now, we can find the velocity factor $\\beta = v/c$ using the momentum:\n    $pc = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c) c = \\gamma \\beta (m_0 c^2)$\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.854$\n\n    The mean decay length is:\n    $L_{lab} = (\\beta\\gamma) \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    $L_{lab} = 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Interpret the \"Observe 30% of Decays\" Condition:**\n    The phrasing \"minimum resolution\" is slightly ambiguous. Let's analyze the most plausible physical interpretations.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The resolution is the characteristic distance by which 30% of particles have decayed. This is not a standard definition of resolution.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** A decay is \"observed\" if its track length is greater than the detector's resolution, $R$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $R$ is given by the exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance} > R) = e^{-R/L_{lab}}$. We want this fraction to be at least 30% ($0.3$).\n        $e^{-R/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.3$\n        This gives an upper limit on the resolution: $R \\le -L_{lab} \\ln(0.3) \\approx 1.204 \\times L_{lab}$.\n    *   **Interpretation C (most likely intended):** The question is asking for a characteristic length scale of the decay process. The most important one is the mean decay length, $L_{lab}$. Let's check if a resolution equal to $L_{lab}$ satisfies the condition. If $R = L_{lab}$, the fraction of observed decays is $e^{-L_{lab}/L_{lab}} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$, or 36.8%. Since 36.8% is greater than 30%, the mean decay length is a valid resolution that meets the criteria.\n\n6.  **Compare Calculation with Options:**\n    Our calculated mean decay length is $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\n    Our calculated value ($1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The difference is about 10%.\n\n7.  **Reconcile the Discrepancy:**\n    This 10% difference strongly suggests a typo in the problem's given values, which is common in textbook problems. Let's assume the answer D is correct and see what input value would produce it. If we assume the intended answer is $L_{lab} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, this would require the particle's rest mass to be $m_0 \\approx 3.095$ GeV. This mass is extremely close to the known mass of the J/ψ meson (3.0969 GeV), a particle commonly studied in high-energy physics. It is highly probable that the problem was intended to be about a J/ψ meson, but its mass was incorrectly stated as 3.41 GeV.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is asking for the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.

Understanding the Decay Law and Observation Condition**\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying in the laboratory frame is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nFor a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's spatial resolution, which we'll call $d$. Therefore, the condition to observe at least 30% of the decays is:\n$P(\\text{distance} > d) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the boundary case. It is common in such physics problems that a percentage like 30% is an approximation for a simple fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that it represents $1/3 \\approx 0.33$. This would mean we want to observe at least $1/3$ of the decays. The boundary condition becomes:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle is relativistic, so its lifetime and decay length are affected by its speed. The mean decay length in the lab frame ($\\lambda$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$ is the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\nUsing particle physics units where energy and mass are in GeV, this simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\nA convenient formula for the mean decay length that combines these factors is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **3.

This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution must be at least 0.3.\n        P(d > R) ≥ 0.3\n    *   The probability of a particle surviving a distance R follows the exponential decay law: P(d > R) = e^(-R/L).\n    *   So, we set the condition for the threshold resolution:\n        e^(-R/L) = 0.3\n    *   Solving for R:\n        -R/L = ln(0.3)\n        R = -L * ln(0.3)\n        R ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n        R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Our calculated required resolution is R ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m. This value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the \"worst\" resolution) that can still detect at least 30% of the decays. Any detector with a better (smaller) resolution will also satisfy the condition.\n    *   Let's examine the given options:\n        A) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\n        B) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\n        C) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\n        D) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n    *   Our calculated value (2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m) is very close to option A (2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m).

Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, relates the energy of a particle to its rest mass and is a measure of the relativistic effects. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (m₀c²).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Rest mass (m₀) = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E / (m₀c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.918\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime (τ₀) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber), the particle's lifetime (τ) is dilated due to its high speed, a phenomenon known as time dilation. The observed lifetime is τ = γτ₀.\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.

Calculation of the Minimum Resolution (d)\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. For a decay to be \"observed,\" the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, `d`. The probability that a particle survives to travel at least a distance `d` follows an exponential decay law: P(l ≥ d) = e^(-d/L).\n\nWe are given that this probability must be at least 30%:\ne^(-d/L) = 0.30\n\nTo solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-d/L = ln(0.30)\nd = -L * ln(0.30)\nd ≈ -(1.885 × 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\nd ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately 2.27 × 10⁻⁶ meters.

The probability that a particle will travel a distance 'x' or more before decaying is given by P(x) = e^(-x/L). To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, 'd'.

The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}$. We want to find the time $t_{30\\%}$ for which the survival probability is 30% (or 0.3).\n\n$P(t_{30\\%}) = e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau} = 0.3$\n\nTo solve for $t_{30\\%}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau}) = \\ln(0.3)$\n$-\\frac{t_{30\\%}}{\\tau} = \\ln(0.3)$\n$t_{30\\%} = -\\tau \\ln(0.3)$\n\n**3.

In this context, \"observing\" a decay means being able to distinguish the decay point from the creation point. This is only possible if the particle travels a distance, $x$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, we need to find the resolution $d$ such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $x > d$ is at least 30%.\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles that survive (do not decay) after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $$ \\frac{N(x)}{N_0} = e^{-x/L} $$\n    where $L$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference. The fraction of particles that we can observe is the fraction that travels a distance greater than the resolution $d$. We set this fraction to 30% (or 0.3):\n    $$ P(x > d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.3 $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):** To find $d$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n    $$ -\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.3) $$\n    $$ d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) $$\n    To calculate $d$, we first need to find the mean decay length, $L$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The particle is relativistic, so we must use concepts from Special Relativity. The total energy ($E$) of the particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $$ E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 $$\n    Given the energy and mass in units of GeV, we can directly calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$):** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $$ \\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 $$\n    The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is the mean decay length, $L$, which is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime.\n    $$ L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau_0 $$\n    For a highly relativistic particle, the velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. A more precise formula for the mean decay length is $L = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Let's calculate the numerical values.\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$.\n\n    First, calculate the mean decay length $L$:\n    $$ L = \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) $$\n    $$ L \\approx \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) $$\n    $$ L \\approx 7.854 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\n    Now, calculate the required resolution $d$:\n    $$ d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) $$\n    $$ d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value for the resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given choices:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is very close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of the initial constants provided in the problem. Option D is the only one that has the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector must have to observe a specific fraction of particle decays. The particle is highly relativistic, so we must apply the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) that is significantly greater than its rest mass ($m_0 = 3.41$ GeV). This indicates that the particle is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light ($c$), and we must account for relativistic effects like time dilation.\n\n2.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor connects the total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m_0$) of a particle through the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Using the given units (GeV for energy and GeV/c² for mass), this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle's lifetime is dilated to $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The average distance it travels before decaying, known as the mean decay length ($\\lambda$), is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. A more direct formula for $\\lambda$ is:\n    $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    This formula incorporates both time dilation and the particle's velocity.\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles ($F$) that travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by:\n    $F = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\n5.  **Condition for Observation:** The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$. This gives us the inequality:\n    $F_{obs} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n6.  **Solving for Resolution:** To find the required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition. This will give us the largest possible value for $d_{res}$ (i.e., the coarsest resolution) that still satisfies the condition.\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n### 2.

We first need to find the momentum term $pc$ using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    \n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n    \n    Now, we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    \n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution ($L$):**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ greater than the resolution $L$ follows the exponential decay law: $P(d > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n    We are given that at least 30% of the decays must be observed, so $P(d > L) \\ge 0.30$.\n    \n    To find the threshold resolution, we solve for the equality:\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    \n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    \n    $L = -\\lambda \\times (-1.204) = 1.204 \\times \\lambda$\n    $L \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Code Verification:**\n    The provided Python code performs this calculation with higher precision:\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    E = 27.0\n    m0c2 = 3.41\n    tau0 = 8e-16\n    c = 299792458.0\n    pc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0c2**2)\n    mean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n    L = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.3)\n    # L = 2.2680e-06 m\n    ```\n    The code output confirms our calculation: $L \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated required resolution is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The distance this particle travels before decaying is called the decay length.\n    *   The decay of individual particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives for a certain distance follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length must be longer than the detector's spatial resolution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m₀).\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (<L>):**\n    The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying (<L>) depends on its proper lifetime (τ₀), its velocity (v), and the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is <L> = γ * v * τ₀. For highly relativistic particles, the velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. A more precise formula uses the particle's momentum `p`: <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀.\n    *   First, find the momentum `p`: p = √(E² - m₀²) = √(27² - 3.41²) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.\n    *   Now, calculate the mean decay length:\n        <L> = (p/m₀) * c * τ₀\n        <L> = (26.78 GeV/c / 3.41 GeV/c²) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n        <L> ≈ 7.853 * (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n        <L> ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution:**\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Determining the Required Resolution\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be distinguishable from its point of creation. This means the particle must travel a distance ($ d $) greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($ x_{res} $).\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $ x_{res} $ before decaying is given by $ P(d > x_{res}) = e^{-x_{res}/L} $.\n\nThe problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Therefore, the resolution must be such that:\n$ P(d > x_{res}) \\ge 0.30 $\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30 $\n\nTo find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies this condition (which corresponds to the \"minimum\" or coarsest acceptable resolution), we solve for the equality:\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} = 0.30 $\n$ -\\frac{x_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\n\nThis result ($ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m) represents the largest resolution that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any resolution smaller than this value would observe a higher percentage of decays.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value of $ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m is closest to option C, $ 2.08 \\times 10^{-6} $ m. The small discrepancy (approximately 10%) is likely due to a slight imprecision in the values provided in the problem statement. For instance, if the proper lifetime were $ 7.25 \\times 10^{-16} $ s instead of $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s, the calculated resolution would be approximately $ 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} $ m, which matches option C almost perfectly. Given the choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    *   Total energy E = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest mass $m_0$ = 3.41 GeV/c², which means the rest energy $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length (L)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The distance it travels is its speed multiplied by this dilated lifetime. For highly relativistic particles, the speed is very close to the speed of light (c).\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The mean decay length is $L \\approx c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Using $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n        $L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum resolution**: The decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, let's call it $\\Delta x$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $\\Delta x$ before decaying is given by $e^{-\\Delta x / L}$.\n    *   We need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we set this fraction to 0.30.\n    *   $e^{-\\Delta x / L} = 0.30$\n    *   To solve for $\\Delta x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{L} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1.204 \\times L$\n    *   $\\Delta x \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Select the closest answer**: The calculated value is approximately $2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    *   B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    *   C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n    Option A is the closest in both numerical value and order of magnitude. The small discrepancy (about 10%) is likely due to a slight inconsistency in the problem's given values and the options, a common occurrence in physics problems.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
