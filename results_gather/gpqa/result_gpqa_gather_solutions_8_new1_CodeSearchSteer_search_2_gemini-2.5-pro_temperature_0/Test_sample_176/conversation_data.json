Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = \\sigma A T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the star, and T is its surface temperature. For a spherical star, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4$\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi \\sigma R_1^2 T_1^4) / (4\\pi \\sigma R_2^2 T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can write:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $T_1/T_2 = (\\lambda_{emitted,2}) / (\\lambda_{emitted,1})$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{emitted,1}$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, calculate the final ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00936$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and account for the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light in its own rest frame: λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b/λ_rest.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n5.  **Applying the Information**:\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Connecting to Temperature**: Now we substitute Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    By simplifying, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    T₂/T₁ = 1 + v₂/c\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug in the values for the velocity of Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s) and the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.99767\n    *   (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\n8.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Finally, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Governing Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`. For a ratio, this simplifies to `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (`λ_observed`) is different from the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) if the star is moving. The formula for redshift (moving away) is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`, where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Connect the Information:**\n    *   We are given the radius ratio: `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2`.\n    *   Star 1 has zero velocity (`v1 = 0`), so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: `λ_observed_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   Star 2 is moving away (`v2 = 700 km/s`), so its observed wavelength is redshifted: `λ_observed_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   By combining these, we find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths: `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Now, we can find the temperature ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula: `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴`.\n    *   I will perform this calculation using Python to get a precise result and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s.

The key physical laws are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted by the star (in its rest frame). The formula is:\n    λ_max_rest * T = b\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For a source moving with a radial velocity 'v' (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_rest) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the luminosity ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\nL₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\nThe ratio is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius ratio (R₁/R₂)**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the radius ratio is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n**Step 4: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their peak wavelengths and velocities.\n*   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n*   We use the Doppler formula to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star.\n    *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Now, we use Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *rest-frame* wavelength:\n    T₁ = b / λ_rest1\n    T₂ = b / λ_rest2\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_rest1) / (b / λ_rest2) = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n*   Substitute the relationship we found from the Doppler effect:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest2 / [λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)] = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles.\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength and the *rest-frame* peak wavelength. Wien's Law applies to the rest-frame wavelength, while the observation is of the Doppler-shifted wavelength. The radial velocity information is essential to connect the two.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final luminosity ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   (1.5)² = 2.25\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.00233495)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / 1.00233495]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.9976706)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99072\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.22912\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.

The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its rest-frame peak emission wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n    *   The observed peak wavelengths are affected by the Doppler shift. The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0), λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   We are given that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n    *   Substituting gives: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperatures: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n        L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n    *   The Python code executed this exact formula with the given values:\n        *   `v2 = 700 * 1000` m/s\n        *   `c = 299792458` m/s\n        *   `R_ratio = 1.5`\n    *   The code's output was `2.229107561148499`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and for Star_2 it is 700 km/s.\n\nThe fact that the stars \"appeared\" brightest at the same wavelength implies that their *observed* peak wavelengths are identical. This observation is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The light from Star_2, which is moving away from us, is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic (source) wavelength.\n\nThe relationship between the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) and the source peak wavelength (λ_source) is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds (as 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light), this is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c)\n\nWhere **v** is the radial velocity and **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFor our stars:\n*   Star_1: v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_source,₁\n*   Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_source,₁ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNext, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength: λ_source = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the source wavelength (T = b/λ_source).\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is therefore:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b/λ_source,₁) / (b/λ_source,₂) = λ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁\n\nFrom our Doppler-derived relation, we can find this wavelength ratio:\nλ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's temperature (T) to the rest-frame wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_rest_max):\n        λ_rest_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant.\n        This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest_max. So, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary (v₁ = 0). This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. The problem also states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂).\n        The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for a velocity much smaller than the speed of light (c) is:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs_max₂ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n        λ_rest_max₁ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosities for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties. The solution involves applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounting for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). This relationship pertains to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The wavelength of light observed from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r) relative to an observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the non-relativistic formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is receding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio is determined using Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can write: λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000).\n\n4.  **Connecting to Temperature**: According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000)] = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (3000/3007)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light (`λ_obs`) changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For an object moving with a radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v` indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n`L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n`L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n\nThe ratio `L1 / L2` is:\n`L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n**4. Determine the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (`R1 / R2`):**\n    The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`. Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (`T1 / T2`):**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). So, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths. We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity `v1 = 0`. With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving, so its light is Doppler shifted.\n        `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n    `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our main equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n\nThe square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script was:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))²`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907)`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe code output provided is `2.2291075611484996`.\n\nThis result is obtained from the derived formula for the luminosity ratio:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (1 + v_{r2} / c)^{-4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 + 700 / 300000)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1.002333...)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.99071447$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229107...$\n\nThis calculated value, `2.2291...`, is closest to the option B) ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{emit} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's constant. This implies that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{emit}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula for this shift is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source (positive if moving away) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this by relating temperature to the peak wavelength. From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$, which means:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relate Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. We need to find the *emitted* wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    $\\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Since $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation from step 3:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n8.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    We need to plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) = $299,792,458$ m/s\n    The calculation is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values and constants\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# From the Doppler shift and Wien's Law, we derived the temperature ratio:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT_ratio = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229200280092933\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.2292.

This law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength.\n-   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of a source is shifted depending on its radial velocity relative to the observer. A positive radial velocity (moving away) causes a redshift (increase in wavelength). The non-relativistic formula is v/c = Δλ/λ_rest or λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nThe key to the problem remains the interpretation of \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" As reasoned before, \"appeared\" refers to the observed wavelength (λ_obs). The inclusion of the specific radial velocity for Star 2 (700 km/s) and a zero velocity for Star 1 strongly suggests this information is intended to be used to correct the observed peak wavelength to the intrinsic peak wavelength, which is then used in Wien's Law to find the temperature.\n\nThe calculation I performed seems correct.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Given Radius Ratio**: R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law**: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n4.  **Wavelengths from Doppler Effect**:\n    *   λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ (since v₁ = 0)\n    *   λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c) (assuming redshift for positive velocity)\n5.  **Equating Observed Wavelengths**: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂ => λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n6.  **Finding Wavelength Ratio**: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n7.  **Substituting into Temperature Ratio**: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

Option D (2.25) would be the answer if the Doppler shift were ignored. The small difference between C and D is the key, and the provided radial velocity data allows for this distinction.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The ratio of the luminosities of two stars is therefore dependent on the ratio of their radii and the ratio of their surface temperatures.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratio of their luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴.\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). Specifically, T is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (or rest-frame) peak wavelength (λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer. The relationship between the observed and rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n6.  **Applying the Data**:\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: From the relationship in the previous step, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute all the values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.

The problem provides a crucial piece of information: \"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the star's emission.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak emission wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince the astronomers determined that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same for both stars, it implies that their intrinsic surface temperatures are also the same. The mention of \"spectroscopy\" is key; this analytical method allows astronomers to determine a star's intrinsic properties by accounting for factors like the Doppler effect. Therefore, we can conclude that T₁ = T₂, which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is extraneous to this specific calculation. The radial velocity would be used to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic peak wavelength, but the problem implies this has already been done.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on a set of given astronomical data. The solution involves applying the principles of black body radiation and the Doppler effect.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Information from Wavelength**: According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest was the same. This implies the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal, which are affected by the stars' motion relative to the observer.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The radial velocity of a star causes a shift in the observed wavelength of its light. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em,₁). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing its light to be redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). The observed wavelength is given by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁\n    *   For Star_2: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Temperature Ratio Calculation**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we have:\n    λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Using Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using v₂ = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

So, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted from the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the star's radial velocity (v). For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThis simplifies to:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**4. Determine the Component Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star_1, with v₁ = 0, there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with v₂ = 700 km/s, the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the component ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**6. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   The calculated value is approximately 2.229.\n*   Comparing this to the options, 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and intended to be a distractor.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength (what \"appeared brightest\") and the *emitted* peak wavelength (which relates to temperature via Wien's Law).

For a spherical star, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4$\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi \\sigma R_1^2 T_1^4) / (4\\pi \\sigma R_2^2 T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{emitted}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n\n    Since we are given $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can write:\n    $\\lambda_{emitted,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    $T_1/T_2 = (\\lambda_{emitted,2}) / (\\lambda_{emitted,1})$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{emitted,1}$:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{emitted,2} / [\\lambda_{emitted,2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (2.25) \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $v_{r,2}/c = (7 \\times 10^5) / (3 \\times 10^8) \\approx 0.002333$\n\n    Now, calculate the final ratio:\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / (1.002333)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 / 1.00936$\n    $L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229$\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23.

Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and account for the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light in its own rest frame: λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b/λ_rest.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n5.  **Applying the Information**:\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Connecting to Temperature**: Now we substitute Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    By simplifying, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    T₂/T₁ = 1 + v₂/c\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug in the values for the velocity of Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s) and the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.99767\n    *   (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\n8.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Finally, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23.

The formula is `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`. For a ratio, this simplifies to `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a star is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (`λ_emitted`). So, `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`. This means `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (`λ_observed`) is different from the *emitted* wavelength (`λ_emitted`) if the star is moving.

The key physical laws are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted by the star (in its rest frame). The formula is:\n    λ_max_rest * T = b\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For a source moving with a radial velocity 'v' (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_rest) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    (This is the non-relativistic approximation, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, c).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the luminosity ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\nL₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\nThe ratio is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**Step 3: Determine the radius ratio (R₁/R₂)**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the radius ratio is:\nR₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n**Step 4: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to relate the temperatures using the information about their peak wavelengths and velocities.\n*   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n*   We use the Doppler formula to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength for each star.\n    *   For Star_1: v₁ = 0 km/s. So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s.

The luminosity (L) of a star is given by the formula:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the radius of the star.\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **T** is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and for Star_2 it is 700 km/s.\n\nThe fact that the stars \"appeared\" brightest at the same wavelength implies that their *observed* peak wavelengths are identical. This observation is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The light from Star_2, which is moving away from us, is redshifted, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic (source) wavelength.\n\nThe relationship between the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) and the source peak wavelength (λ_source) is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds (as 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light), this is:\n\nλ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c)\n\nWhere **v** is the radial velocity and **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFor our stars:\n*   Star_1: v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_source,₁\n*   Star_2: v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSince λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have:\nλ_source,₁ = λ_source,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNext, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's surface temperature to its intrinsic peak emission wavelength: λ_source = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the source wavelength (T = b/λ_source).\n\nThe ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is therefore:\nT₁ / T₂ = (b/λ_source,₁) / (b/λ_source,₂) = λ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁\n\nFrom our Doppler-derived relation, we can find this wavelength ratio:\nλ_source,₂ / λ_source,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates a star's temperature (T) to the rest-frame wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (λ_rest_max):\n        λ_rest_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant.\n        This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest_max. So, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary (v₁ = 0). This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. The problem also states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂).\n        The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) for a velocity much smaller than the speed of light (c) is:\n        λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs_max₁ = λ_rest_max₁\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs_max₂ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Since λ_obs_max₁ = λ_obs_max₂, we have:\n        λ_rest_max₁ = λ_rest_max₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        λ_rest_max₂ / λ_rest_max₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\n    Let's plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosities for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their physical properties. The solution involves applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounting for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). This relationship pertains to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The wavelength of light observed from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity (v_r) relative to an observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the non-relativistic formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is receding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature ratio is determined using Wien's Law, which connects temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: λ_emitted₁ = λ_obs₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can write: λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000).\n\n4.  **Connecting to Temperature**: According to Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ / [λ_emitted₂ * (1 + 7/3000)] = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) = 3000/3007.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (3000/3007)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). The formula is `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies that `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_emitted`.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light (`λ_obs`) changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For an object moving with a radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v` indicates the object is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n`L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴`\n`L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴`\n\nThe ratio `L1 / L2` is:\n`L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)`\n\nThe constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n**4. Determine the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (`R1 / R2`):**\n    The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`. Therefore, `R1 / R2 = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (`T1 / T2`):**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). So, the temperature ratio is `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    We need to find the ratio of the *emitted* wavelengths. We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity `v1 = 0`. With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`. This star is moving, so its light is Doppler shifted.\n        `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for our temperature calculation:\n    `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into our main equation:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n\nThe square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   `R1 / R2 = 1.5`\n*   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n*   `c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script was:\n`L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))²`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907)`\n`L1 / L2 ≈ 2.2291`\n\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe code output provided is `2.2291075611484996`.\n\nThis result is obtained from the derived formula for the luminosity ratio:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (1 + v_{r2} / c)^{-4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n*   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s (speed of light)\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 + 700 / 300000)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1.002333...)^{-4}$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.99071447$\n$L_1 / L_2 \\approx 2.229107...$\n\nThis calculated value, `2.2291...`, is closest to the option B) ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{emit} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's constant. This implies that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{emit}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). The formula for this shift is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source (positive if moving away) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the ratio $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$. We can do this by relating temperature to the peak wavelength. From Wien's Law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$, which means:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit,2} / \\lambda_{emit,1}$\n\n5.  **Relate Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:**\n    We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.

So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emitted,1} = b / T_1$.\n    *   **Star 2:** $v_2 = 700$ km/s.

This matches option A. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe search results confirm the physical laws I intended to use.\n-   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power (L = 4πR²σT⁴).\n-   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T = b/λ_max). This law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength.\n-   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of a source is shifted depending on its radial velocity relative to the observer. A positive radial velocity (moving away) causes a redshift (increase in wavelength). The non-relativistic formula is v/c = Δλ/λ_rest or λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nThe key to the problem remains the interpretation of \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" As reasoned before, \"appeared\" refers to the observed wavelength (λ_obs). The inclusion of the specific radial velocity for Star 2 (700 km/s) and a zero velocity for Star 1 strongly suggests this information is intended to be used to correct the observed peak wavelength to the intrinsic peak wavelength, which is then used in Wien's Law to find the temperature.\n\nThe calculation I performed seems correct.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Given Radius Ratio**: R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law**: T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n4.  **Wavelengths from Doppler Effect**:\n    *   λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁ (since v₁ = 0)\n    *   λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c) (assuming redshift for positive velocity)\n5.  **Equating Observed Wavelengths**: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂ => λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n6.  **Finding Wavelength Ratio**: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n7.  **Substituting into Temperature Ratio**: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The mass information is extraneous, likely to distract from the correct method.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach involves using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law, and the Doppler effect.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nMy calculated value is ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23. Option D (2.25) would be the answer if the Doppler shift were ignored. The small difference between C and D is the key, and the provided radial velocity data allows for this distinction.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The ratio of the luminosities of two stars is therefore dependent on the ratio of their radii and the ratio of their surface temperatures.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratio of their luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²(T₁/T₂)⁴.\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the star's surface temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). Specifically, T is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (or rest-frame) peak wavelength (λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁.\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer. The relationship between the observed and rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula. For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for motion away from the observer).\n6.  **Applying the Data**:\n    *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂(1 + v₂/c).\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: From the relationship in the previous step, we find the ratio of the rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We can now substitute all the values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s))]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe solution to this problem relies on two fundamental laws of stellar astrophysics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\nFirst, the luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. This law relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so we know that R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the temperatures (T₁/T₂). The problem provides a crucial piece of information: \"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the star's emission.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak emission wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince the astronomers determined that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same for both stars, it implies that their intrinsic surface temperatures are also the same. The mention of \"spectroscopy\" is key; this analytical method allows astronomers to determine a star's intrinsic properties by accounting for factors like the Doppler effect. Therefore, we can conclude that T₁ = T₂, which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is extraneous to this specific calculation. The radial velocity would be used to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic peak wavelength, but the problem implies this has already been done.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on a set of given astronomical data. The solution involves applying the principles of black body radiation and the Doppler effect.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Information from Wavelength**: According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest was the same. This implies the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal, which are affected by the stars' motion relative to the observer.\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect**: The radial velocity of a star causes a shift in the observed wavelength of its light. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁) is the same as its emitted peak wavelength (λ_em,₁). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing its light to be redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength). The observed wavelength is given by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁\n    *   For Star_2: λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n6.  **Temperature Ratio Calculation**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we have:\n    λ_em,₁ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Using Wien's Law (λ_em = b/T, where b is a constant), we can substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    This simplifies to T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Using v₂ = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s:\n    v₂/c ≈ 700,000 / (3 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies the stars should be treated as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
