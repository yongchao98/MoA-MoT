    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are common to both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   The star's properties ($T_{eff}$ and $R_*$) are the same for both planets.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels.\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2 / a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit ($e=0$) and assuming the planetary mass is much smaller than the stellar mass ($M_p \\ll M_*$), the formula is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n    Now, we form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx \\frac{M_2^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_1^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes (K):** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the formula:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. The ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Masses (M):**\n    $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n9.  **Combine the Ratios to find a₂/a₁:** Substitute the mass and K ratios into the equation from step 6:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ into the equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    Now, we compute the final numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 9: Calculate the ratio a2/a1\na2_over_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# Step 10: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio=}\")\n```\n>>>\nT_ratio=0.5357142857142857\n<<<\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\nLet's set up the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$. We can cancel these terms from the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) is related to the planet mass ($M_p$), star mass ($M_*$), and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit ($e=0$) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's ($M_p \\ll M_*$), the formula is:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p,1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nWe are given the masses of the planets:\n$M_{p,1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n$M_{p,2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\nSo the mass ratio is:\n$\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
