As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n\nThe first step is to analyze the phenotypes of the single and double mutants involving G2.\n\n*   **Single mutants:**\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance.\n    *   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant has **0%** resistance, meaning G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur.\n\n*   **Double mutants:**\n    *   `g1g2` (G1 and G2 knocked out): Resistance is **0%**.\n    *   `g2g3` (G2 and G3 knocked out): Resistance is **0%**.\n\n*   **Epistasis Analysis:** Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene's mutation. We compare the double mutant phenotype to the single mutant phenotypes.\n    *   The phenotype of `g1g2` (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` mutant (75%). This means the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of `g2g3` (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` mutant (50%). This means the `g2` mutation is also **epistatic** to the `g3` mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion about G2:** When a gene's mutant phenotype masks the phenotypes of other gene mutations, it often means that gene acts upstream in the genetic pathway. Given that we know one of the genes is a transcription factor (a regulatory gene that often acts upstream), this strong epistatic effect of `g2` over both `g1` and `g3` is compelling evidence that **G2 is the transcription factor**. It likely controls the expression or function of G1 and G3. This conclusion eliminates option C, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3\n\nNow, let's look at the interaction between G1 and G3, which are downstream of G2.\n\n*   **Single mutants:**\n    *   Loss of G1 (`g1`) causes a 25% reduction in resistance (from 100% to 75%).\n    *   Loss of G3 (`g3`) causes a 50% reduction in resistance (from 100% to 50%).\n\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:**\n    *   Resistance is **10%**. This is a reduction of 90% from the control.\n\n*   **Interaction Analysis:**\n    *   If G1 and G3 acted in completely separate, independent pathways, the combined loss of resistance might be additive (25% + 50% = 75% loss, leaving 25% resistance).\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than this additive expectation. The combined loss of 90% is greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This type of interaction, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than the sum of the single mutants, is called **synergy**.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 have overlapping or related functions. The plant can partially compensate for the loss of one, but losing both is catastrophic to the resistance mechanism. \"Gene redundancy\" is a much better description of this interaction than \"pleiotropy\" (a single gene affecting multiple traits) or \"same promoter\" (a specific molecular mechanism that we cannot conclude from this data). This makes Option B's description of the G1/G3 interaction the most accurate.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Final Epistasis Claim (G1 vs. G3)\n\nThe options include a final claim about epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n*   Options A and B claim: \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". For this to be true, the `g1g3` double mutant should have the same phenotype as the `g1` single mutant.\n    *   `g1g3` phenotype = 10% resistance.\n    *   `g1` phenotype = 75% resistance.\n    *   Since 10% ≠ 75%, this statement is factually incorrect based on the data.\n\n*   Option D claims: \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". For this to be true, the `g1g3` double mutant should have the same phenotype as the `g3` single mutant.\n    *   `g1g3` phenotype = 10% resistance.\n    *   `g3` phenotype = 50% resistance.\n    *   Since 10% ≠ 50%, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nThere appears to be an error in all the options regarding the G1/G3 epistasis. However, in a multiple-choice question, we must choose the *best* possible answer based on the evidence.\n\n### 4. Synthesize and Choose the Best Option\n\nLet's review the components of the remaining options (A, B, D):\n\n*   **Option A:** G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 show pleiotropy (Incorrect description of their interaction), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n*   **Option B:** G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 show gene redundancy (Correct description of their synergistic interaction), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n*   **Option D:** G2 is a TF (Correct), G1/G3 has the same promoter (Cannot be determined), G3 is epistatic towards G1 (Incorrect).\n\nOption B contains two correct and crucial conclusions drawn directly from the data: G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Although its third clause about epistasis is flawed, it is overall the most accurate description of the genetic relationships.\n\n<<<B>>>"
