  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to two protons each, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is further downfield due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carboxylic acid group.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and likely the methine group at 2.9 ppm. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to a methine group (-CH-). This proton is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm), and it is also attached directly to the aromatic ring (explaining its downfield shift).\n            *   **Putting the alkyl fragments together:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. They are connected via the CH and CH₂ groups. The entire group is -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4 with a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (A), which is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P / HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Alkyl groups and aromatic rings are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   **Prediction:** The -COOH group on the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group. The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   After reduction, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   Comparing this name to the options provided:\n        *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Starting Material)\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Correct Product)\n        *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect isomer)\n        *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
