    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the relative population of atomic energy levels in stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This situation is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms, N, in two different energy states, i and j:\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   `N_i` and `N_j` are the populations of the energy levels `i` (excited state) and `j` (lower state).\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excitation\" typically refers to the ratio of the population of an excited state to a lower state (often the ground state). Let's define the excitation ratio `R = N_i / N_j`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to both stars:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1, the excitation ratio is:\n        R_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2, the excitation ratio is:\n        R_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The energy levels of the iron atom (`ΔE`) and their statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_j`) are the same in both stars.\n\n5.  **Use the condition given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n6.  **Set up the equation and solve:**\n    (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_j) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_i / g_j)` cancels out:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem states the energy difference is `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n    Let's calculate the value of the term `ΔE / k`:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived, physically correct equation is `ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2) ]`.\n    Let's examine the options:\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    B) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\n    Option A has the exact same algebraic form as our derived equation but is missing the `1 K` constant factor. This makes option A dimensionally inconsistent as written (dimensionless = 1/Temperature). However, the other options are incorrect in their fundamental physical form.\n    *   Option B has an incorrect functional form.\n    *   Option C has an incorrect power in the denominator.\n    *   Option D has the wrong sign (`+` instead of `-`), which would imply the cooler star is more excited.\n\n    Given that the numerical data was chosen specifically to make the constant factor `ΔE / k` equal to `1 K`, it is highly probable that the question intended for this factor to be treated as a dimensionless `1`, leading directly to option A. This is a common simplification or oversight in physics problems presented in a multiple-choice format. Option A is the only one that represents the correct physical relationship.\n\n<<<A>>>"
