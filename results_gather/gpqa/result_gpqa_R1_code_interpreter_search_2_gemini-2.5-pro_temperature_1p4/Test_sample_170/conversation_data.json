    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzenes. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-substituted product. The weight fraction of a product is directly proportional to its mole fraction (or mole percent yield) because all monobrominated isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the substances by increasing percentage yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Substituents\nFirst, we classify each substituent on the benzene ring as either an ortho-, para-director or a meta-director. This is the most crucial factor determining the product distribution.\n*   **Ortho-, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups) or halogens.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. They are typically deactivating groups with a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 (methyl) is an activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating group but is an **ortho-, para-director** (a special case for halogens).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating group and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Grouping\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** {2, 4, 6}. These will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho-, para-directors):** {1, 3, 5}. These will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n\nTherefore, the final sequence must have substances {2, 4, 6} at the beginning (lowest yield) and substances {1, 3, 5} at the end (highest yield). This eliminates options C and D, which do not follow this pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Ordering the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)\nFor ortho-, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile.\n*   Let's compare the steric bulk of the substituents: -Cl, -CH3, and -C2H5.\n*   -Cl is a single atom.\n*   -CH3 (methyl group) is larger than a single chlorine atom.\n*   -C2H5 (ethyl group) is larger than a methyl group.\n*   So, the order of increasing steric bulk is: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   A larger group leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer should increase in this same order.\n*   Increasing para-yield order: **Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n### Step 5: Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)\nFor meta-directors, the para-yield is always very low. The subtle differences among them depend on their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho and para positions even less reactive, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n*   Let's compare the deactivating strength of the substituents: -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5**.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Thus, nitrobenzene (4) will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) and ester (-COOC2H5) groups have very similar, strong deactivating effects. Differentiating between them can be complex, but they are both significantly weaker deactivators than the nitro group. The order between them is debatable, but they will both have higher para-yields than nitrobenzene.\n\n### Step 6: Assembling the Final Sequence\n1.  The ortho-, para-director sequence is **3 < 1 < 5**.\n2.  The meta-directors {2, 4, 6} will have lower para-yields than the o,p-directors.\n3.  The combined sequence should look like: **{ordering of 2, 4, 6} < 3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nNow, let's examine the remaining options, A and B, to see which one matches the required o,p-director order of `...3 < 1 < 5`.\n\n*   A) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - The o,p order is `...1<5<3`. This is incorrect.\n*   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - The o,p order is `...3<1<5`. This matches our derived order based on steric hindrance.\n\nThe order of the meta-directors in option B is 4 < 2 < 6. This means para-yield(NO2) < para-yield(COOC2H5) < para-yield(COOH). This implies that -NO2 is the strongest deactivator (correct) and that -COOC2H5 is a stronger deactivator than -COOH (debatable, but a minor point). The overall structure of the answer, especially the clear ordering of the ortho-, para-directors based on a standard chemical principle (sterics), makes option B the most logical choice.\n\nFinal sequence: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\n<<<B>>>"
