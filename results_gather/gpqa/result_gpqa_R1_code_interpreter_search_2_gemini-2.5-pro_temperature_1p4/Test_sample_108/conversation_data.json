    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a **1S0** state.\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   From `1S0`, we can deduce the quantum numbers of the initial NN system:\n    *   Total Spin `S(NN)_initial`: `2S+1 = 1` => `S = 0`.\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L(NN)_initial`: The letter `S` corresponds to `L = 0`.\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J(NN)_initial`: `J = 0`.\n*   The total angular momentum of the system is `J_initial = J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(NN)_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`. The total initial parity is `P_initial = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `d`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X relative to the final NN system, let's call it `L(X)`.\n    *   `s` -> `L(X) = 0`\n    *   `p` -> `L(X) = 1`\n    *   `f` -> `L(X) = 3`\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction:\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total initial angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`. The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J(NN)_final` and the total angular momentum of particle X, `J(X)`. For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN)_final = J(X)`. We will assume the emitted particle X is spinless (`S(X)=0`), so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `J(X) = L(X)`. Thus, the condition is **`J(NN)_final = L(X)`**.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN)_final * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   The parity of the final NN state is `P(NN)_final = (-1)^L(NN)_final`.\n    *   The intrinsic parity of X is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The condition becomes: `+1 = (-1)^L(NN)_final * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L(NN)_final + L(X) + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is **`L(NN)_final + L(X)` must be an odd number**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics (as given):** The final NN state must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Since we are given `T(NN)_final = 0`, the condition becomes `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is **`S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an odd number**.\n\nAlso, a fundamental (unlisted) constraint is that for a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN)=3` and `L(X)=3`. `3=3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN)+L(X) = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Statistics:** `S(NN)+L(NN) = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). (OK)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN)=1` and `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN)+L(X) = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Statistics:** `S(NN)+L(NN) = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   This state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. S=3 is not allowed. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted.\n*   For completeness, let's check the other rules:\n    *   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN)=1` and `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN)+L(X) = 2+1 = 3` (Odd). (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics:** `S(NN)+L(NN) = 3+2 = 5` (Odd). (OK)\n*   This reaction is forbidden because the final NN state is impossible.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN)=0` and `L(X)=0`. `0=0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN)+L(X) = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Statistics:** `S(NN)+L(NN) = 1+1 = 2` (Even). The rule for `T=0` requires this sum to be odd. **(VIOLATED)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given for a T=0 final state.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth reactions C and D are forbidden, but for different reasons.\n*   Reaction C is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. This is a violation of the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition.\n*   Reaction D is forbidden because the `3P0` state (`S=1, L=1`) violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the question for a final state with `T=0`. The `3P0` state requires `T=1`.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of ... Pauli statistics\". Option D presents a direct violation of this rule under the given conditions. Option C violates a more fundamental principle not explicitly listed in the prompt's checklist, and it formally satisfies the three rules the prompt asks to be checked. Therefore, the most likely intended answer is the one that fails the specific tests provided.\n\nThe state `3P0` must have T=1. The problem asks us to consider a transition to a final state with T=0. Since `3P0` cannot have T=0, any such transition to it is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>"
