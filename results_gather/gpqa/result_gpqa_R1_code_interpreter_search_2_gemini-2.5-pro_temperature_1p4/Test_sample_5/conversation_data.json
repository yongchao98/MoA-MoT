    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The goal is to find the energy spectrum, which means finding the allowed energy levels of the system.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve if the potential is separable in a certain coordinate system. Let's try converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe conversion formulas are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))²\nSince x = r cos(θ), we have:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k x²\n\nNow, group the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential is now in the form V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y), where:\n*   Vₓ(x) = 2kx²\n*   Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. When the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional equations, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\n**3. Solve the 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) Problems**\n\nThe standard form for a 1D QHO potential is V(q) = 1/2 mω²q², and its energy eigenvalues are given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    We compare Vₓ(x) = 2kx² with the standard form 1/2 mωₓ²x²:\n    1/2 mωₓ² = 2k\n    ωₓ² = 4k/m\n    ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\n    Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m))\n    Eₙₓ = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    We compare Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky² with the standard form 1/2 mωᵧ²y²:\n    1/2 mωᵧ² = 1/2 k\n    ωᵧ² = k/m\n    ωᵧ = √(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n    Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n**4. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term ħ√(k/m):\nE = [(2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 1 + 1/2) ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis expression represents the energy spectrum of the particle. The quantum numbers nₓ and nᵧ can take any non-negative integer values (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) E = (2nₓ+3nᵧ+1/2) ħ√(k/m)\nB) E = (nₓ+3nᵧ+3/2) ħ√(k/m)\nC) E = (2nₓ+nᵧ+3/2)ħ√(k/m)\nD) E = (3nₓ+2nᵧ+1/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nOur derived energy spectrum, E = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2) ħ√(k/m), matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
