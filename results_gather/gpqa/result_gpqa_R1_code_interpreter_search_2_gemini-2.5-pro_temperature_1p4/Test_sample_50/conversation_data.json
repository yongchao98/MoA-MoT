    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded conductor is held at a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the **method of images**. To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The potential outside the original sphere's volume is then the superposition of the potential from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**2. Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor the potential on the surface of the sphere (at any point at radius `R` from the center) to be zero, the image charge and its position must be:\n\n*   **Position of image charge (b):** The image charge `q'` is located along the same line as the original charge `q` and the center of the sphere. Its distance `b` from the center is given by:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The magnitude of the image charge is related to the original charge by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge, which makes sense as the sphere's surface must have induced charges of the opposite sign to attract the external charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy of the System**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A general formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution builds up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, we need to calculate the potential produced by `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   The location of charge `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The location of the image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at the position of `q` is:\n`V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k = 1 / (4πε₀)`).\n\n**4. Substitute and Simplify**\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the potential equation:\n\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, calculate the potential energy `U` using `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's compare this result with the given choices:\nA) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
