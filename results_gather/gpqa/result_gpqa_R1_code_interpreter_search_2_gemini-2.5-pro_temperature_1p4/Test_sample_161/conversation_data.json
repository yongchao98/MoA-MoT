    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the given metric**\n\nThe problem provides a metric, which is a formula for measuring distances on a surface. The metric is given by:\n$ds^{2} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} (dx^{2} + dy^{2})$\n\nThis formula describes a 2-dimensional space using coordinates $(x, y)$. The term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" indicates that the coordinate system is valid for the domain where $x^2 + y^2 < 2^2$, i.e., an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Determine the Area Element**\n\nThe area of a surface defined by a metric is calculated by integrating the area element, $dA$, over the entire surface. The area element is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor.\n\nFrom the given $ds^2$, we can write down the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2 + 2g_{12}dxdy + g_{22}dy^2$\n\nBy comparing this with the given metric, we have:\n$g_{11} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}$\n$g_{22} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}$\n$g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor can be written as a matrix:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor, $\\det(g)$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\frac{32^2}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})^2}$\n\nThe area element is the square root of the determinant:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{32^2}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})^2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n$dA = \\frac{32}{|4 - x^{2} - y^{2}|} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nSince the domain is $x^2 + y^2 < 4$, the denominator $4 - x^2 - y^2$ is always positive. Therefore, we can remove the absolute value:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**3. Set up the Area Integral**\n\nTo find the total area $A$, we need to integrate the area element $dA$ over the domain of the pseudosphere, which is the disk $D$ defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 4$.\n\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**4. Convert to Polar Coordinates**\n\nThe integral is much easier to solve in polar coordinates. We use the standard transformation:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n$x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$\n$dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates becomes:\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n\nThe integral transforms to:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right)$\n\nThe first part is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nThe second part is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2}$ is undefined at the upper limit $\\rho=2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_{\\rho} = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\nWe use the substitution method. Let $u = 4 - \\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\n$I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{\\rho=0}^{\\rho=a} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{u=4-0^2}^{u=4-a^2} -16 \\frac{du}{u}$\n$I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} [-16 \\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-a^2}$\n$I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} [-16 \\ln(4-a^2) - (-16 \\ln(4))]$\n$I_{\\rho} = \\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} [16 \\ln(4) - 16 \\ln(4-a^2)]$\n\nAs $a$ approaches $2$ from below, the term $4-a^2$ approaches $0$ from above ($0^+$). The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z$ approaches $0^+$.\n$\\lim_{a \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4-a^2) = -\\infty$\n\nTherefore, the radial integral is:\n$I_{\\rho} = 16 \\ln(4) - 16(-\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nSince the integral with respect to $\\rho$ diverges to infinity, the total area $A$ is also infinite:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the surface is infinite. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
