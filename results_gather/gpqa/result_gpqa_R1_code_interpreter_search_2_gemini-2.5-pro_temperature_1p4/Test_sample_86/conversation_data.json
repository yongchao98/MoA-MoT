    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula Core:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms (C8).\n    *   **Structural Features:** It contains a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring (which accounts for 6 carbon atoms, C6) with two substituents. Therefore, the substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum shows the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Compound:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents, let's call them R1 and R2.\n    *   From the FTIR data, one substituent must be a halogen atom attached directly to the ring (e.g., -Cl, -Br). So, R1 = -X.\n    *   The other substituent, R2, must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most plausible structure for a C2 substituent containing a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group** (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n    *   The ring is di-substituted. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). Symmetrical para-substitution is very common in textbook problems as it gives a simple, recognizable NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Proposed Structure (para-Haloacetophenone):**\n    *   Let's assume the structure is `4-haloacetophenone`.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is symmetrical about the axis passing through the two substituents. This means there are only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):**\n        *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) are chemically equivalent. They are deshielded and will appear downfield. Each of these protons is coupled to one neighboring proton, so they will appear as a **doublet**. (Signal A: ~7.7-8.0 ppm, Integration: 2H, Multiplicity: d).\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X) are also chemically equivalent. Each is coupled to one neighboring proton, so they will also appear as a **doublet**. (Signal B: ~7.4-7.7 ppm, Integration: 2H, Multiplicity: d).\n        *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) has 3 protons.\n        *   These protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons attached. Therefore, they are not coupled to any other protons and will appear as a **singlet**. (Signal C: ~2.3-2.6 ppm, Integration: 3H, Multiplicity: s).\n    *   **Summary of Prediction:** We expect to see two doublets in the aromatic region (2H each) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (3H).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (usually > 6.5 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts and splitting patterns do not match our predicted structure or any other simple isomer. It is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, which is perfect for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This data is a perfect match for our predicted spectrum of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm strongly indicates an aldehyde (-CHO). The two doublets in the aromatic region suggest para-substitution. The 2H singlet at 3.7 ppm would be a methylene group (-CH2-). This suggests the structure is `(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde`.\n        *   However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the methylene protons (-CH2-). They should couple with each other. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet. The data provided lists them both as singlets (\"s\"), which is incorrect. Therefore, this option is inconsistent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a plausible chemical structure (para-haloacetophenone) that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
