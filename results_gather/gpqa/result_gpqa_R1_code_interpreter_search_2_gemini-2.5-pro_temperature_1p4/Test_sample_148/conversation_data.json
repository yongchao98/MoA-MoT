    "*   **Analysis of the experimental data:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and they are in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   This indicates the presence of two different molecular species in an approximately 1:1 ratio, where the environment of this specific alpha-proton is slightly different in each species.\n    2.  **LC-MS:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram, also in a roughly 1:1 ratio. This means there are two compounds that can be separated by chromatography.\n        *   The analysis is done at an elevated temperature. This is important because it suggests the two species are stable isomers that do not interconvert rapidly even with added thermal energy. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers (like rotamers around an amide bond), they would likely coalesce into a single peak at elevated temperatures.\n        *   Both chromatographic peaks yield the same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This confirms that the two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass).\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In standard (achiral) analytical techniques like NMR (in an achiral solvent) and LC (on an achiral column), enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of NMR peaks and a single peak in the chromatogram. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has at least two chiral centers and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, a common side reaction is the racemization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during the amide bond formation step. If the peptide already contains other chiral amino acids, this racemization creates a mixture of diastereoisomers (e.g., coupling an L/D mixture of an amino acid to an all-L peptide chain). Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and are therefore distinguishable by standard analytical techniques. They will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum and different retention times on an LC column. Since they have the same chemical formula, they will have identical mass spectra. This explanation fits all the experimental observations perfectly.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean that two amino acid residues were added instead of one. This would result in a product with a significantly higher molecular weight than the expected compound. The MS data contradicts this. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass, which are distinguishable by NMR, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a known issue in solid-phase or solution-phase peptide synthesis, where racemization during coupling can occur.\n\n<<<C>>>"
