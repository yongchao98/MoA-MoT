    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic proton on the α-carbon (the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls) is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The carbon atoms of the double bond are designated as α (adjacent to the carbonyl group) and β (further from the carbonyl group). So the structure is p-Tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enolate from dimethyl malonate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, acts as a nucleophile.\n    2.  It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is called a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n    3.  The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This results in a new enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃.\n    4.  This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during the workup step to yield the final neutral product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product has the following structure: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃.\n*   **Naming Product A:** We need to find the correct IUPAC name for this structure among the options. Let's analyze the names provided.\n    *   The options suggest naming it as a substituted propane-tricarboxylate. This involves identifying a three-carbon chain and treating the methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) as the principal functional groups.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain of our product to match the nomenclature system used in the options. We can identify a main chain of three carbons: the carbon from the malonate, the β-carbon from the acrylate, and the α-carbon from the acrylate.\n        (MeOOC)₂**C**H - **C**H(p-tolyl) - **C**H₂-COOMe\n    *   Let's number this C3-C2-C1 chain in a way that aligns with IUPAC rules for this type of name. We'll assign C1 to the carbon with two ester groups:\n        (MeOOC)₂CH(C1) - CH(p-tolyl)(C2) - CH₂(C3)-COOMe. This is not quite right.\n    *   Let's try numbering it as presented in the correct name: \"propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" means the main chain is C3-C2-C1, and there are carboxylates at C1 (two of them) and C3.\n        Let's draw this parent structure: (MeOOC)₂CH(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH₂(C3)(COOMe).\n    *   Now add the substituent \"2-(p-tolyl)\" to this parent structure. The p-tolyl group goes on C2:\n        (MeOOC)₂CH(C1)-CH(p-tolyl)(C2)-CH₂(C3)(COOMe).\n    *   Let's compare this structure, derived from the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, with the product we derived from the reaction mechanism: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃. They are identical.\n    *   Let's check the other name: \"trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate\". This would have a different substitution pattern: (p-tolyl)CH₂-CH(COOMe)-CH(COOMe)₂, which is not the product of this reaction.\n    *   Therefore, **Product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a Michael addition using an enamine as the nucleophile.\n*   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The α-carbon of the original ketone (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is the nucleophilic center.\n*   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). Its structure is CH₃-C(β)H=C(α)H-CN.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The crucial final step is the acidic workup (H₃O⁺), which hydrolyzes the iminium ion. Hydrolysis of an iminium ion regenerates the carbonyl group (ketone).\n*   **Product B Structure:**\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is reformed from the enamine.\n    *   A new substituent is added at the α-position (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is the remnant of the but-2-enenitrile after the reaction: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   So, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group attached at the 2-position.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The product is a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon (C1). The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    CH₃(C4)-CH(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CN(C1)\n              |\n           (2-oxocyclohexyl)\n    The name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, corresponds to the enol tautomer. While tautomerism exists, the keto form is generally the major and more stable product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **Product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, but we are asked to identify a reactant (C) given the other reactant and the final product. This requires a retrosynthetic analysis.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:**\n    1.  A Michael reaction forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. We need to identify this bond in the product and \"break\" it to find the starting materials.\n    2.  The product structure is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring with a 2-(3-oxobutyl) substituent. The 3-oxobutyl group is -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃.\n    3.  This 3-oxobutyl group comes from the Michael acceptor, MVK (CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃). The β-carbon of MVK is the CH₂ group. After addition and protonation, it becomes part of the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ chain.\n    4.  The donor (C) must have provided the cyclohexane-1,3-dione part of the molecule. The bond was formed at C2 of this ring, which is the highly acidic position between the two carbonyls.\n    5.  Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) would deprotonate the C2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate that attacks MVK.\n    *   The other option for C, \"2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\", is chemically nonsensical as written. If it intended to mean the enol tautomer (3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one), the diketone form is the standard way to represent the starting material.\n    *   Therefore, **Reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
