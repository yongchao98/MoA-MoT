    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CxHy can be approximated as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, or `6y ≈ 12x`, leading to `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   The problem states Z is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a component of Y. So, one component is the cycloalkane `CnH2n`.\n    *   Let the other component be D. The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that component D must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. As it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   The general formula for a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon corresponding to a cycloalkane `CnH2n` is `CnH(2n-6)` (e.g., benzene `C6H6` corresponds to cyclohexane `C6H12`).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (`CnH2n`) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (`CnH(2n-6)`).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorize bromine water. This means they are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture X also produces only Z (`CnH2n`). This means A and B have the same carbon skeleton as Z and are unsaturated precursors to it.\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is also an equimolar mixture, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C + D`, where C and D are the components of Y.\n        `A + B -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane, and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's determine the formulas of A and B. Since they are unsaturated precursors to `CnH2n`, they are likely a cycloalkene and a cyclodiene.\n        *   A cycloalkene has the formula `CnH(2n-2)`.\n        *   A cyclodiene has the formula `CnH(2n-4)`.\n    *   Let's check if this fits the reaction: `CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   Total atoms on the left: C = 2n, H = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   Total atoms on the right: C = 2n, H = 2n + (2n-6) = 4n-6.\n    *   The reaction is balanced. So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (A) and a cyclodiene (B).\n\n4.  **Apply the \"No Conjugated Bonds\" Constraint**\n    *   The problem states that compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A, the cycloalkene `CnH(2n-2)`, has only one double bond, so it cannot have conjugated bonds.\n    *   B, the cyclodiene `CnH(2n-4)`, can have conjugated or isolated double bonds. The constraint requires us to choose an isomer with isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We have a general solution that works for different values of n (e.g., n=6, n=7, etc.).\n        *   **Case n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`). Y is {cyclohexane, benzene (`C6H6`)}. X is {cyclohexene (`C6H10`), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C6H8`)}. 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. This is a valid solution.\n        *   **Case n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (`C7H14`). Y is {methylcyclohexane, toluene (`C7H8`)}. X is {methylcyclohexene (`C7H12`), a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene like 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (`C7H10`)}. This is also a valid solution.\n    *   To find the final answer, we must choose between these cases. In such chemistry problems, the simplest, most fundamental parent system is usually the intended answer unless otherwise specified. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the most fundamental example of this type of chemistry.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Based on the choice of n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are:\n        *   Liquid A: Cyclohexene, `C6H10`\n        *   Liquid B: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, `C6H8`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in `C6H10`) + (H atoms in `C6H8`) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
