    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n### 1. Analyze the System and Charges\n\n*   We have a spherical conductor of radius $R$. It is initially uncharged.\n*   Inside the conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor. The distance of P from the center of the conductor is $L$ ($L > R$).\n\n### 2. Apply the Principle of Charge Induction\n\n1.  **Inner Surface:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conductor material, the electric field must be zero (as it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Outer Surface:** The conductor was stated to be initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, and charge must be conserved, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. This charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\nSo, the final charge distribution is:\n*   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $-q$ on the surface of the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n### 3. Use the Property of Electrostatic Shielding\n\nA key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n\n*   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all three charge distributions: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n*   However, a fundamental result from electrostatics (provable by the uniqueness theorem) is that the electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) exactly cancel each other out everywhere outside the cavity. This combination produces zero electric field in the conductor's bulk and everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n### 4. Determine the Field from the Outer Surface Charge\n\n1.  **Charge Distribution:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since this surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to achieve electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Field of a Uniform Spherical Shell:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere (this is a direct result of Gauss's Law or direct integration).\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the same as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe various other distances and angles provided in the problem ($r$, $s$, $l$, $\\theta$) describe the geometry of the cavity and the position of point P relative to the cavity. However, due to the complete electrostatic shielding provided by the conductor, these details are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. The external field only depends on the net charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor's shielding)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
