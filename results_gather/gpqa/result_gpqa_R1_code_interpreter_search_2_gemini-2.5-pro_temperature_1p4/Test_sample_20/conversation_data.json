    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be easily interconverted. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione):** Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and two double bonds at positions 2 and 5. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are -CH₂- groups. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is planar (or very close to it) and possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
