    "This problem is about radioactive decay, which is characterized by a memoryless process. This means the probability of decay in a future interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\n**1. Understand the Model of Radioactive Decay**\nThe probability that an atom has not decayed by a certain time `t` (i.e., it survives) is given by the survival function:\n`S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find a Parameter**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n`P(100) = 0.32`\nSo, `1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\nSolving for the exponential term, we get:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nWe don't need to find `λ` itself; having the value of `e^(-100λ)` is sufficient.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nLet `T` be the time of decay. We need to find the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom survived the first 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\nTherefore:\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\nWe can rewrite the exponential term `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in step 2:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nFinally, the probability of decay is:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the probability P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\nprint(probability)\n```\nThe result of this calculation is approximately 0.4393.\n\n`0.4393` corresponds to `43.93%`, which rounds to 44%.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 52%\nB) 40%\nC) 48%\nD) 44%\n\nThe calculated probability matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The crucial property of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an event happening in the future is independent of what has happened in the past.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the decay probability:** The probability `P(t)` that an atom decays by time `t` is given by the formula `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it survives beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the given data to find the decay parameter:** We are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the question:** We want to find the probability that the atom decays in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.

Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the required probability:** We need to calculate `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can find `e^(-150λ)` using the information from step 2 (`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`).\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the known value: `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n6.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThe result is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.
