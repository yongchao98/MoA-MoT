    "This question asks to identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the function of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that results in a severely truncated or completely garbled protein, rendering it non-functional.\n\nLet's analyze the effects of each mutation by comparing the mutant sequences to the intact gene's coding sequence. The sequence is DNA, so we will read it in groups of three (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...`\n*   This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) - Alanine (Ala) - Glycine (Gly) - Threonine (Thr) - Serine (Ser) ...\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   `ATG` -> `ATG` (No change)\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC` (Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine. This is a **silent mutation**.)\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC` (`CTC` codes for Leucine, `TAC` codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**.)\n*   **Effect:** This mutation results in a protein with one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this *could* potentially disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and active site. It is less certain to eliminate function compared to more drastic mutations.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   `ATG` -> `ATG` (No change)\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC` (Silent mutation, Phe -> Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA` (`CTC` codes for Leucine, but `TAA` is a **stop codon**.)\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence (at the third codon position). Protein synthesis will halt here, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Intact:  `ATGTTTCTC GCT...` (Total 48 characters shown before `...`)\n    *   Mutant 3: `ATGTTTTAC GCT...` (Total 49 characters shown before `...`)\n*   **Effect:** The mutant sequence is one nucleotide longer than the intact sequence. This indicates an **insertion** of one base. An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is shifted for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and garbled amino acid sequence. This will almost certainly produce a non-functional protein, and often leads to a premature stop codon down the line.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Intact: `...GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant 4: `...GCT ACT...`\n*   **Effect:** The sequence `GGT` has been deleted. This is a **deletion of three nucleotides**, which corresponds to one full codon (the codon for Glycine). Because the number of deleted bases is a multiple of three, the reading frame is preserved. The resulting protein will simply be missing one amino acid (Glycine). This is an **in-frame deletion**. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly effective at knocking out gene function. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (3rd codon). This is the most direct and definitive way to ensure that a functional protein is not produced, as translation is terminated almost immediately. Therefore, it is the mutation most probably to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<C>>>"
