    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This points towards a compound used in studies where isotopic labeling is common, often involving isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, or ¹⁸O.\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4, 5: Reaction of X with Y.**\n        *   X + Y (liquid) → W (gas) + G (precipitate). The reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test common gases:\n            *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2p, 0n. No.\n            *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n            *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16p, 16n. Yes.\n            *   CO (¹²C¹⁶O): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n            *   D₂ (²H₂): 2p, 2n. Yes. This connects back to the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   The precipitate G, when heated, releases B.\n        *   The melting point of B is ~277 K. 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is extremely close to 277 K. This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Connecting the dots:** If the reaction produces D₂O (as B), it's highly likely that the \"heavier isotope\" is Deuterium (D). This makes **D₂** the most probable candidate for the gas W. For the reaction to produce D₂ gas and eventually D₂O, substance Y (the liquid) is likely D₂O itself. The violent reaction X + D₂O → D₂(g) + ... is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent, specifically a metal deuteride.\n\n    *   Let's propose a reaction: **Metal Deuteride (M-D) + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide (M-OD) + D₂**.\n        *   This fits perfectly. X is a metal deuteride. Y is D₂O. W is D₂ gas. G is the metal deuteroxide (M-OD).\n        *   Now, we check if G (M-OD) upon heating gives B (D₂O). Indeed, many metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). For example, 2M-OD → M₂O + D₂O. This works.\n\n2.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X**\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** The \"close analog\" would be the protium (¹H) version. Metal hydrides are common reagents (reducing agents). Key examples are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. Both are plausible candidates for X.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   NaBH₄ is a mild reducing agent and would typically only reduce the ketone but not the carboxylic acid. The product would be a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which still contains 2 oxygens. This fits.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones (to secondary alcohols) and carboxylic acids (to primary alcohols).\n        *   Reaction: R-CO-COOH + LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This product is a diol and contains **2 atoms of oxygen**.\n        *   While both reagents could yield a product with two oxygens, LiAlH₄ is known for its violent reactivity with water, matching the description \"reacts violently with liquid Y\". NaBH₄ reacts much more gently. Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n\n    *   **Identify X**: Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements**: The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n        *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n        *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n    *   **Read the calculation instruction**: \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This means we need to sum the total mass of all Hydrogen atoms and the total mass of all Aluminum atoms in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for simplicity, as suggested by the answer choices.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al). There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass**: Sum the two totals.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
