    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Key Concept: Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n3.  Specific structural features like **axial chirality** (e.g., in substituted biphenyls, allenes) or planar chirality, which lead to non-superimposable mirror images even without a chiral center.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO₂) and methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The large size of these ortho substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Because of this steric hindrance, the rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, making it chiral. This is an example of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon atom is a **chiral center**. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a double bond. It is bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). Therefore, it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar due to the rigid C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
