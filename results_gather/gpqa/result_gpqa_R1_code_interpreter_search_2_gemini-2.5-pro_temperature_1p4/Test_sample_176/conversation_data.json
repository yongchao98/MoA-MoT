    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principles:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The key physical laws governing a black body's radiation are:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's total luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_max). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. This law applies to the light *as it is emitted* from the star's surface (the rest frame wavelength).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the observed wavelength of light is shifted due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. An object moving away has its light shifted to longer wavelengths (redshift), and an object moving towards us has its light shifted to shorter wavelengths (blueshift).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n        *   L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n        *   L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n    *   To find the ratio L1/L2, I'll divide the first equation by the second. The constants (4, π, σ) will cancel out:\n        *   L1 / L2 = [4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴] / [4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴]\n        *   L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information into the Ratio:**\n    *   **Radius:** The problem states R1 = 1.5 * R2. Therefore, the ratio (R1/R2) is 1.5. Squaring this gives (R1/R2)² = 1.5² = 2.25.\n    *   **Temperature:** This is the trickiest part. We need to find the ratio (T1/T2). The information we have is about the *observed* peak wavelengths being the same, and the stars have different radial velocities.\n        *   Let λ_emitted,1 and λ_emitted,2 be the peak wavelengths emitted by the stars in their rest frames.\n        *   Let λ_observed,1 and λ_observed,2 be the peak wavelengths measured by the astronomers on Earth.\n        *   We are told λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2.\n\n5.  **Connect Observed Wavelength to Temperature:**\n    *   Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T) connects temperature to the *emitted* wavelength, not the observed one.\n    *   The Doppler effect connects the emitted and observed wavelengths. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift (which is an excellent approximation here since v << c) is:\n        λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_rad/c), where v_rad is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   **For Star_1:** v_rad,1 = 0 km/s. So, λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   **For Star_2:** v_rad,2 = 700 km/s. So, λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   Since λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   Now, I'll substitute Wien's Law into this equation:\n        (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   The constant 'b' cancels out:\n        1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   Rearranging to find the temperature ratio (T1/T2):\n        T2/T1 = (1 + 700/c)\n        T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now I have all the pieces for my luminosity ratio formula.\n    *   L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700,000 m/s / 299,792,458 m/s)]⁴\n\n7.  **Use a Calculator/Code for Precision:** This calculation is best done with a tool to avoid rounding errors. I will use Python for this.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\n# Ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nv2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n\n# The square of the radius ratio\nradius_ratio_sq = radius_ratio**2\n\n# The Doppler shift factor for Star_2.\n# Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2),\n# and Star_1 has zero radial velocity (lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_obs_1),\n# we have: lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)\n# Using Wien's Law (lambda_emitted = b/T), we get:\n# b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\ntemp_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\n\n# The fourth power of the temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio_pow4 = temp_ratio**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_sq * temp_ratio_pow4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n>>>2.229107931393693\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated result is approximately 2.229. Looking at the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.23\n    *   B) ~2.32\n    *   C) ~2.25\n    *   D) ~2.35\n\n    The value 2.229 rounds to 2.23. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Governing Law for Luminosity:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a black body star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity\n    *   R is the star's radius\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n    *   T is the star's surface temperature\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio L1 / L2, we divide the equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    L1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)\n    The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R1 = 1.5 * R2. Therefore, the ratio (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio (T1 / T2). The key pieces of information are:\n        *   The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars.\n        *   The stars have different radial velocities.\n        *   Wien's Displacement Law relates temperature to the *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted): T = b / λ_emitted, where b is Wien's constant.\n        *   The Doppler effect relates the *emitted* wavelength to the *observed* wavelength (λ_observed): λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_rad/c), where v_rad is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n    *   Let λ_obs_1 and λ_obs_2 be the observed peak wavelengths. We are given λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.\n    *   For Star_1: v_rad_1 = 0 km/s. Therefore, λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted_1.\n    *   For Star_2: v_rad_2 = 700 km/s. Therefore, λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + 700/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, we can set the expressions for the emitted wavelengths equal:\n        λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   Now, substitute Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T) into this equation:\n        b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   The constant 'b' cancels out:\n        1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + 700/c)\n    *   Rearrange the equation to find the temperature ratio T1 / T2:\n        T2 / T1 = 1 + 700/c\n        T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + 700/c)]⁴\n    The code execution has already performed this calculation.\n    The output `2.229107561148499` rounds to `2.23`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. This matches option A. (Note: The information about the masses of the stars is irrelevant to this specific problem).\n\n<<<A>>>"
