    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic dipole moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_{L}$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B})$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write it as $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator is then:\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B$\n\nThe expectation value of the energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is found by replacing the operator $L_z$ with its eigenvalue, $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) B = m\\mu_B B$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. The problem gives:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m$ is a small integer. We can use $m=1$ for the order of magnitude calculation.\n*   The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$, has a value of approximately $9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **2. Analyze the Transition Energy**\n\nThe transition energy, $\\Delta E$, of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ JÂ·s\n*   The speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{8}$ m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26}}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}} \\text{ J} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ J\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ J\n\nTo compare them, we can look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small ($2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman splitting caused by a 1 Tesla magnetic field is a very small perturbation to the energy level structure of the Hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<D>>>"
