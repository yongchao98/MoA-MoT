    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the two scenarios and their respective mean free paths.**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the vacuum chamber. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*. The key point here is that all particles (the projectile and the target) are similar molecules and are in random thermal motion.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*. The key point here is that the projectile (electron) is very different from the target (gas molecule), especially in terms of speed.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path from Kinetic Theory.**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n    *   However, this simple formula assumes the target particles are stationary. When the target particles are also moving randomly, as is the case for gas molecules colliding with each other, the formula must be modified to account for their relative motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the formula for λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions).**\n    *   In a gas where all molecules are in thermal motion, the effective collision rate is higher than if the targets were stationary. Kinetic theory shows that this is accounted for by adding a factor of the square root of 2 (`√2`) to the denominator.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among its peers is:\n        `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules and `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section for two gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formula for λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions).**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by a 1000 kV potential, meaning they are moving at extremely high, near-relativistic speeds.\n    *   In contrast, the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules (at room temperature) is many orders of magnitude smaller. For the purpose of collision analysis, the gas molecules can be considered effectively **stationary** targets relative to the fast-moving electrons.\n    *   When the targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is not needed. The formula for the mean free path is:\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2.**\n    *   Let's establish the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n        `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]`\n        `λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)`\n        `λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n    *   The relationship between the two mean free paths depends on two factors: the `√2` from the relative motion and the ratio of the collision cross-sections (`σ_gg / σ_eg`).\n    *   As a first-order approximation, let's assume the effective size of the gas molecule is roughly the same for a collision with another molecule as it is for a collision with an electron (i.e., `σ_gg ≈ σ_eg`). This is a simplification, but it captures the dominant physical effect.\n    *   Under this assumption, the ratio becomes:\n        `λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2`\n    *   Since `√2 ≈ 1.414`, this means:\n        `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options based on this result.**\n    *   We have found that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, by a factor of approximately 1.414.\n    *   A) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1`: This is incorrect. Our derived value of `1.414 * λ1` is not less than `1.22 * λ1`.\n    *   B) `λ2 < λ1`: This is incorrect. λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   C) `λ2 = λ1`: This is incorrect. It ignores the fundamental difference in the collision scenarios.\n    *   D) `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`: This is correct. Our calculated value `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1` satisfies this condition, as `1.414 >= 1.22`. This option correctly captures that the electron's mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ1). The value 1.22 provides a lower bound that is consistent with the theoretical factor of `√2`. Even if the electron scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is somewhat different from the gas-gas kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`, the `√2` factor is the dominant term, ensuring that λ2 is substantially larger than λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
