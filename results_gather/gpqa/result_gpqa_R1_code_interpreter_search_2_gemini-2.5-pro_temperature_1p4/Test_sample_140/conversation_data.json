    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine). The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.\n\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n(2)D--C(1)\n   |  |\n(3)H--C(6)H\n   \\ /\n (4)H-C(5)H\n```\n\nThere are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton from C6 or a deuteron from C2.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C6**\n    The NH₂⁻ ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deutero-benzyne**.\n\n    1-bromobenzene-2-d  → [loss of H⁺ from C6 and Br⁻ from C1] → 2-deutero-benzyne (Intermediate I)\n\n    Because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, this pathway is kinetically favored (Primary Kinetic Isotope Effect).\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C2**\n    The NH₂⁻ ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    1-bromobenzene-2-d → [loss of D⁺ from C2 and Br⁻ from C1] → benzyne (Intermediate II)\n\n    This pathway is slower than Path A but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion, NH₂⁻ (or its conjugate acid, NH₃, followed by deprotonation). This nucleophile adds to the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate I (2-deutero-benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is asymmetric. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and there is a deuterium atom at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by the solvent (NH₃) to give the final product. The NH₂ group is at C1, and the D atom is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The NH₂ group is at C6, and the D atom is at C2. The relative positions of the -NH₂ group and the D atom are meta (1,3). This product is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n\n    Thus, the asymmetric Intermediate I yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Addition to Intermediate II (benzyne)**\n    This intermediate is symmetric. The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation gives a single product. This product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n    Thus, the symmetric Intermediate II yields only one product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we get three possible, structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
