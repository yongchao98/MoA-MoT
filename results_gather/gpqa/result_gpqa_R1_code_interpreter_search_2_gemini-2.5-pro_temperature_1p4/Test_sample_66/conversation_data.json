    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The problem states that the system is in a coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    In this notation:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    A measurement is performed on the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of these operators are the \"uncoupled\" states, denoted as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ or simply $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ when $l_1$ and $l_2$ are known.\n    *   For electron 1 ($l_1=1$), the possible values for its magnetic quantum number are $m_{l1} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The corresponding eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ are $-1\\hbar, 0\\hbar, 1\\hbar$.\n    *   For electron 2 ($l_2=1$), the possible values for its magnetic quantum number are $m_{l2} \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The corresponding eigenvalues of $L_{2z}$ are $-1\\hbar, 0\\hbar, 1\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Final State:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    The final state we are interested in is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum's Z-component:**\n    The initial state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    Any possible final state after measurement must also be an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's check the eigenvalue for our desired final state $|\\phi\\rangle = |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$:\n    $L_z |\\phi\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$\n    $L_z |\\phi\\rangle = (m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar) |\\phi\\rangle$\n    $L_z |\\phi\\rangle = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |\\phi\\rangle = -2\\hbar |\\phi\\rangle$.\n    The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for the desired final state is $-2\\hbar$, which corresponds to a total magnetic quantum number of $m_{\\text{final}} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in state $|\\phi\\rangle$ when it is initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of $|\\psi\\rangle$ onto $|\\phi\\rangle$:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    The term $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-component of the total angular momentum is conserved, i.e., $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    In our case:\n    *   Initial total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   Final total magnetic quantum number: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    It is impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured and found to have a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. The conservation of the z-component of angular momentum forbids this outcome. Thus, the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
