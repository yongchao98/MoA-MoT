    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided information to deduce the building blocks of the molecule.\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This points to a benzene ring with two substituents attached, meaning the ring itself has the formula `-C6H4-`. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE: 3 for the double bonds and 1 for the ring).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\"**: This means the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. The carbonyl (`C=O`) in the ester adds 1 more DBE.\n*   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**:\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the aromatic protons (which would integrate to 4H total) strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)**: This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The vinyl proton (`=CH-`) adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet. The second vinyl proton (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment adds a `C=C` double bond, which is another 1 DBE. It also contains one `-CH3` group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups**: We've already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It eliminates the possibility of having ethyl, propyl, or any other alkyl chain containing a `-CH2-` group in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Expected Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nBased on the fragments identified, we can calculate the total DBE for the molecule.\n*   Benzene ring: 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (`C=O`): 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (`C=C`): 1 DBE\n*   **Total Expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n### **3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's combine the identified pieces:\n*   A `para`-substituted benzene ring: `-C6H4-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (formula fragment: C3H5)\n*   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula fragment: C2H3O2)\n\nCombining these gives a potential structure: methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\nLet's calculate its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11 C\n*   Hydrogens: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12 H\n*   Oxygens: 2 (from ester) = 2 O\n*   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis proposed structure is consistent with all the data: it is a di-substituted aromatic ring, has an ester, a propenyl group with the correct NMR pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and no -CH2- groups.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options based on DBE and Structural Constraints**\n\nNow, let's check the given options. We can use a simple Python script to calculate the DBE for each formula to see which ones are plausible.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (Double Bond Equivalent).\"\"\"\n    import re\n    atoms = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {atom: (int(count) if count else 1) for atom, count in atoms}\n    C = counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = counts.get('H', 0)\n    N = counts.get('N', 0)\n    # Formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    dbe = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\n    return dbe\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n}\n\nprint(f\"Expected DBE based on structure: 6\")\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}): DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nExpected DBE based on structure: 6\nOption A (C12H14O2): DBE = 6\nOption B (C12H12O2): DBE = 7\nOption C (C11H14O2): DBE = 5\nOption D (C11H12O2): DBE = 6\n</execute_result>\nThe DBE calculation eliminates options B (DBE=7) and C (DBE=5), as they do not match the required DBE of 6. We are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Option D (C11H12O2)**: As derived above, this formula corresponds perfectly to a structure like methyl 4-(propenyl)benzoate, which fits all the given spectral data, including the critical \"no -CH2- groups\" constraint.\n\n*   **Option A (C12H14O2)**: This formula also has the correct DBE of 6. However, it contains one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (`CH2`) compared to option D. To build a molecule with this formula that still fits the other criteria (di-substituted aromatic, ester, propenyl group), we would need to add a `-CH2-` group somewhere. The most likely structure would be ethyl 4-(propenyl)benzoate (`CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH2CH3`). This molecule, however, contains an ethyl group, which has a `-CH2-` signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. This directly contradicts the information that \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C11H12O2** is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, 1H NMR signals, number of substituents, and absence of -CH2- groups).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code execution successfully calculated the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the DBE results:**\n    *   The structure deduced from the spectroscopic data (aromatic ring + one C=O + one C=C) requires a DBE of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Option A (C12H14O2): DBE = 6. This is a possibility.\n    *   Option B (C12H12O2): DBE = 7. This is incorrect.\n    *   Option C (C11H14O2): DBE = 5. This is incorrect.\n    *   Option D (C11H12O2): DBE = 6. This is a possibility.\n\n2.  **Differentiate between the remaining options (A and D):**\n    We must now use the more detailed NMR information, specifically the fact that there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n\n    *   **Option D (C11H12O2):** As reasoned in the first step, a possible structure is methyl 4-(propenyl)benzoate.\n        *   Its components are: `-C6H4-` (aromatic ring), `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group), and `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n        *   Let's check the groups present: It has aromatic CH, vinyl CH, and two distinct -CH3 groups.\n        *   Importantly, this structure **contains no -CH2- groups**. This perfectly matches all the provided data.\n\n    *   **Option A (C12H14O2):** This formula has one more carbon and two more hydrogens than option D (i.e., one extra `-CH2-` unit).\n        *   To construct a plausible molecule with this formula that retains the other required features (di-substituted ring, propenyl group, ester), we would need to incorporate a `-CH2-` group. For example, we could have an ethyl ester, leading to a structure like ethyl 4-(propenyl)benzoate (`-COOCH2CH3`).\n        *   This structure would have a `-CH2-` group, which would produce a distinct signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   This directly **contradicts** the experimental observation that \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\"\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Only the formula C11H12O2 can be used to construct a molecule that satisfies all the given constraints: a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, two methyl groups, and a complete absence of methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n<<<D>>>"
