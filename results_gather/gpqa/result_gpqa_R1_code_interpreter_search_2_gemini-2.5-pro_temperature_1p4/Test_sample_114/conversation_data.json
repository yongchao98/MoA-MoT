    "This is a classic relativistic collision problem involving electron-positron annihilation. We need to use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve it.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    *   We have an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$), which have the same rest mass, $m_e$.\n    *   Let's set the horizontal axis as the x-axis.\n    *   The electron moves from left to right (positive x-direction) with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   The positron moves from right to left (negative x-direction) with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   We will use units where the speed of light, $c=1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   The energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   The momentum is related to energy by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$. This gives the magnitude of the momentum as $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (m_e c)^2} = \\frac{m_e c^2}{c} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Since we set $c=1$, the formulas simplify to $E = \\gamma m_e$ and $p = m_e \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n    *   **Electron ($e^-$):**\n        *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e = 4 m_e$.\n        *   Momentum magnitude: $p_e = m_e \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e \\sqrt{15}$.\n        *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_e = (+ \\sqrt{15} m_e, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Positron ($e^+$):**\n        *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e = 2 m_e$.\n        *   Momentum magnitude: $p_p = m_e \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e \\sqrt{3}$.\n        *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_p = (- \\sqrt{3} m_e, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e + 2 m_e = 6 m_e$.\n    *   Total Momentum: $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Define the Final State:**\n    *   Two photons ($\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$) are produced.\n    *   They have the same energy: $E_{\\gamma_1} = E_{\\gamma_2} = E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   For a photon, the momentum magnitude is $p = E/c$. With $c=1$, $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   Photon 1 moves \"upper-right\". Let its direction make an angle $\\theta_1$ with the positive x-axis. Its momentum is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma_1} = (p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_1, p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_1)$.\n    *   Photon 2 moves \"lower-right\". Let its direction make an angle $\\theta_2$ with the positive x-axis. Its momentum is $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma_2} = (p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_2, p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_2)$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final} \\implies 6 m_e = E_{\\gamma_1} + E_{\\gamma_2} = 2 E_{\\gamma}$.\n        This gives the energy of each photon: $E_{\\gamma} = 3 m_e$.\n        Therefore, the momentum of each photon is also $p_{\\gamma} = 3 m_e$.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum.\n        $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma_1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma_2} = ((p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_1 + p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_2), (p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_1 + p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_2))$.\n        We equate the initial and final momentum vectors:\n        $\\vec{P}_{initial} = \\vec{P}_{final}$\n\n    *   **y-component of momentum:**\n        The initial momentum in the y-direction is 0.\n        $0 = p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_1 + p_{\\gamma} \\sin\\theta_2 \\implies \\sin\\theta_1 = -\\sin\\theta_2$.\n        Given that one photon goes \"upper-right\" ($\\sin\\theta_1 > 0$) and the other \"lower-right\" ($\\sin\\theta_2 < 0$), this implies that the angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let $\\theta_1 = \\theta$ and $\\theta_2 = -\\theta$.\n\n    *   **x-component of momentum:**\n        $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e = p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_1 + p_{\\gamma} \\cos\\theta_2$.\n        Substitute $p_{\\gamma} = 3 m_e$ and the angles:\n        $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e = (3 m_e) \\cos\\theta + (3 m_e) \\cos(-\\theta)$.\n        Since $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos\\theta$:\n        $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e = 6 m_e \\cos\\theta$.\n        Divide by $6m_e$:\n        $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Angle:**\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This angle is $\\alpha = \\theta_1 - \\theta_2 = \\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n    *   We first find $\\theta$ by taking the arccosine of the expression we found.\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)$.\n    *   The total angle is $\\alpha = 2 \\times \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)$.\n\n    We can compute this value using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value inside the arccos\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2*theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n```output\n138.18129048383216\n```\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.18 degrees. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 172\nB) 74\nC) 96\nD) 138\n\nThe closest answer is 138.\n\n<<<D>>>",

Let's say their directions make angles $+\\theta$ and $-\\theta$ with the positive x-axis.
