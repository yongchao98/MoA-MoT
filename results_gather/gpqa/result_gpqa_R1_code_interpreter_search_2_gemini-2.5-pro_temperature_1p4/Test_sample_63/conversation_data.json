    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what happens in each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas contained oxygen atoms. The most common gases that do this are O₂ or N₂O.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the element that combined with the copper, which is oxygen.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. It is an inert gas. In the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nSince salts A and B decompose completely into a mixture of gases (H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of O, and N₂), the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms end up in H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** The final inert gas is N₂. We need to account for all sources of N₂. Let's assume the oxidizing gas was N₂O (a common product from heating nitrogen salts).\n    *   Reaction in Tube #3: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   Moles of N₂O = Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   The total remaining N₂ (Gas C) is 0.10 mol. So, 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly from the initial decomposition.\n    *   Total moles of N atoms = 2 × (direct N₂) + 2 × (N₂ from N₂O) = 2 × 0.05 mol + 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms end up in H₂O and the oxidizing gas.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O in oxidizing gas) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check the total mass:\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.007 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass ≈ 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) containing only N, H, and O. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. Let A be NH₄NO₂ and B be NH₄NO₃.\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, so let there be `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n\nLet's look at the decomposition reactions at 200°C:\n*   **A (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   **B (NH₄NO₃):** At 200°C, the main reaction is: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nLet's see if `n` moles of each salt produce the observed amounts of products.\n*   From `n` mol of A: `n` mol N₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n*   From `n` mol of B: `n` mol N₂O + `2n` mol H₂O\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n\n*   Total N₂O = n\n\nNow let's match this with our findings from step 1 & 2:\n*   Total H₂O = 0.20 mol  =>  4n = 0.20  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   N₂O produced = 0.05 mol => n = 0.05 mol. (This is the gas that reacted with Cu, providing 0.05 mol of O atoms). This matches.\n*   N₂ produced directly = 0.05 mol => n = 0.05 mol. This is part of Gas C.\n*   The other part of Gas C is the N₂ from the decomposition of N₂O in tube #3 (0.05 mol). Total Gas C = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the *formulas* of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   Atoms: 1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   Atoms: 1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both formulas = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
