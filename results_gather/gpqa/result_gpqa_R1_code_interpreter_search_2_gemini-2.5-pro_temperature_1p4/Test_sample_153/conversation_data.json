IR Data Analysis:\n#    - Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1: This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n#    - Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1: This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n#    - IR Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates Option A (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and Option B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde and a phenol). Options C and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids, are consistent with the IR data.\n\n# 2. 1H NMR Data Analysis:\n#    - 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): This very deshielded singlet corresponds to a single proton and is in the typical range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n#    - Aromatic Region: We have two signals, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). This pattern indicates 4 protons on a benzene ring.\n#    - The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent to each other, resulting in an AA'BB' splitting pattern that often appears as two simple doublets.\n#    - Let's compare this to the expected patterns for the remaining options:\n#        - Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid): This is a para-substituted benzene ring. It would show exactly the pattern observed: two doublets of 2H each. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group would be more deshielded (downfield, 8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match.\n#        - Option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid): This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. There is no symmetry that would make protons equivalent. All 4 aromatic protons would be unique and would split each other, leading to a much more complex pattern (e.g., four distinct multiplets like doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets), not two simple doublets of 2H.\n#    - NMR Conclusion: The aromatic splitting pattern definitively points to a para-substituted ring.\n\n# 3. Final Conclusion:\n#    - MS indicates MW=156 and one Cl atom. All options fit.\n#    - IR indicates a carboxylic acid. Options C and D fit.\n#    - 1H NMR indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. Only option C fits.\n#    - Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\nprint(\"Reasoning complete. The only structure that fits all data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires a systematic analysis of different spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molar mass of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M⁺ and M⁺+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed formula for the options, C₇H₅ClO₂: (7 × 12.01) + (5 × 1.01) + (1 × 35.45) + (2 × 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. Using the specific isotopes, the mass with ³⁵Cl is 156, and with ³⁷Cl is 158.\n    *   *Conclusion*: The MS data confirms the compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four given options are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that has formed a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, as found in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   *Conclusion*: The IR data strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates option **A (Phenyl chloroformate)**, which is an acid chloride, and option **B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)**, which is an aldehyde and a phenol. We are left with options C and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet (`s`) representing one proton (`1H`) in a highly deshielded environment (`11.0 ppm`). This chemical shift is classic for a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**H**), which further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (7-8.5 ppm):** We see two signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons.\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet for two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining possibilities:\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-(ortho)-disubstituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, resulting in a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-(para)-disubstituted ring. Due to symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are equivalent and would appear as a downfield doublet. The two protons next to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as a slightly more upfield doublet. This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy combining all pieces of evidence, the only structure that is consistent with all the spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
