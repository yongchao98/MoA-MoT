    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq(4) / T_eq(2). Let's write out the formulas for both planets:\n    T_eq(4) = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)\n    T_eq(2) = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Ratio = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_4))^(1/2) * (1 - A_4)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms are constant for both planets and can be canceled out:\n    *   They orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same.\n    *   The problem states they have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2.\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\n    After cancellation, the expression simplifies to:\n    Ratio = (1 / a_4)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)\n    Ratio = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:** To find the ratio of the orbital distances (a_2 / a_4), we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rewritten as: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Orbital Distances:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of their orbital periods:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Formula:** Now, substitute the expression for (a_2 / a_4) back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    Ratio = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By applying the power of a power rule [(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)], we get:\n    Ratio = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    Ratio = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can find the specific ratio for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute this value into the final equation:\n    Ratio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    Ratio = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    Ratio ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n\n    To get the numerical answer, we compute the cube root of 4/7.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio of the periods\n    period_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n    \n    # The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio\n    temperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n    \n    print(temperature_ratio)\n    ```\n    >>>\n    0.8298751381381717\n    \n    The result is approximately 0.83.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
