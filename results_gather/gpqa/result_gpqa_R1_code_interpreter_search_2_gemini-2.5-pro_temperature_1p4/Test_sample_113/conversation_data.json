    "*   **Reaction 1 Analysis: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction transforms a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n    2.  **Step-by-step mechanism:**\n        *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        *   This alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin.\n    3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction by protonating the alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Among the given options for A (NaHSO₃ and H₃O⁺), H₃O⁺ represents an aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄), which is a standard source of protons for this final step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Reaction 2 Analysis: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction. The presence of H₂O in the reactants confirms this.\n    2.  **Reaction Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst.\n    3.  **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   The options for B are CH₃COOH (acetic acid) and HCl (hydrochloric acid).\n        *   CH₃COOH is a weak acid and is generally not effective in catalyzing nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   HCl is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   Therefore, B = HCl is the suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   For the first reaction, the required reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, the required reagent B is HCl.\n    *   Matching these requirements with the given options, we find that option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
