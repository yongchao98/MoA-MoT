    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type Identification**: This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The base's role is to deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C1). They are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms the thermodynamic enolate, where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate acts as a nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ carbon.\n    *   This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The reaction is completed by a protonation step (e.g., from the solvent or a workup), which quenches the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Product Structure A**: The resulting product has the ethyl acrylate chain, which becomes a `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group, attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The skeleton of the product is:\n        ```\n             O\n            //\n          C1--C2(Et, Me)\n         /   \\\n      C6(Me, CH₂CH₂COOEt)  C3\n      |       |\n      C5------C4\n        ```\n    *   Now, we need to name this product. According to the options, the product is named as an ethyl propanoate with a substituted cyclohexyl group.\n    *   Let's re-number the cyclohexyl ring for naming purposes, where the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is C1. This corresponds to the original C6.\n        *   **New C1** (original C6): Attached to the propanoate and has a methyl group. This fits the `1-methyl` part of the name `(..1,3-dimethyl..)`\n        *   Numbering the ring to give the ketone (oxo group) the lowest possible number, we number towards the original C1.\n        *   **New C2** (original C1): This is the carbonyl carbon (`-oxo-`). This fits the `2-oxo` part.\n        *   **New C3** (original C2): This carbon has an ethyl and a methyl group. This fits the `3-ethyl-3-methyl` part.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the structure for A in options A and B.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type Identification**: This reaction involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H**₂-NO₂) is acidic.\n    *   Deprotonation by OH⁻ yields the nucleophilic nitronate anion: CH₃CH₂**CH**⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n    *   The structure of but-2-enenitrile is CH₃(β)-CH(α)=CH-CN. The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the one bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane forms a new C-C bond with the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n        `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]`---`[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]`\n    *   After protonation from the water solvent, we get the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Structure B**: The structure of the product is:\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n5.  **IUPAC Nomenclature**: To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n        ```\n           NO₂  CH₃\n           |    |\n        C6H₃-C5H₂-C4H--C3H--C2H₂--C1N\n        ```\n    *   The parent chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the structure for B in options B and D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This eliminates options C and D.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This eliminates option A.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
