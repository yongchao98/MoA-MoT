    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's draw its structure and identify the key features.\n    ```\n          O(1)\n         /   \\\n      C(2)=O  C(6)H2\n       |       |\n      C(3)H2   C(5)H2\n       \\       /\n        C(4)H-Et \n    ```\n    The ring is numbered starting from the heteroatom (oxygen) as position 1 and continuing towards the carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The molecule has a chiral center at position C4, which is bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen, and two different parts of the ring.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nSix-membered (delta) lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of 5-hydroxy carboxylic acids. Let's determine the structure of the hydroxy acid that would cyclize to form our product.\n\n*   By conceptually hydrolyzing the ester bond of the lactone, we get the open-chain hydroxy acid:\n    `HOOC(at C2)-CH2(at C3)-CH(Et)(at C4)-CH2(at C5)-CH2-OH(from O1 and C6)`\n*   Let's renumber this chain according to IUPAC rules for carboxylic acids (COOH is C1):\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\n*   The precursor molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this precursor is C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.\n*   It describes a derivative of **3-ethylpentanedioic acid** (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   It is a mono-ester, where one acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl).\n*   The name \"pentanoic acid\" implies the -COOH group is at C1. \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" implies the isobutyl ester is at C5.\n*   The structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`.\n\nNow let's analyze the reagents' selectivity.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`) reacts with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H+), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`) reacts with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester at C5 untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H+), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization (transesterification). The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reaction sequence does not involve the chiral center at C3. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
