    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Detection Criteria\n\n1.  **Instrument:** ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n2.  **Detection Threshold:** A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel.\n3.  **Exposure Time:** 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n4.  **Observatory Location:** Paranal Observatory, Chile. This is crucial for determining which stars are visible in the sky.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Apparent Magnitude (m_V)\n\nWe need to find the faintest star (i.e., the largest apparent V magnitude) that can be detected under these conditions. The provided ESPRESSO overview link contains a performance table. For the \"1-UT mode\" (one 8m telescope) and an exposure of 3600s, the table gives:\n\n*   For a star with V = 16 mag, the S/N is 12.\n*   For a star with V = 17 mag, the S/N is 7.5.\n\nOur required S/N is 10. Since an S/N of 12 is achieved for a V=16 star, any star brighter than (i.e., with a smaller magnitude than) V=16 is definitely detectable. A star with V=17 gives S/N=7.5, which is below our threshold. The limiting magnitude is therefore between 16 and 17. Any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V` significantly fainter than 16 will likely not be detectable, and any star brighter will be. We will use `m_V < 16.5` as a reliable cutoff for a star to be bright enough.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A star must rise to a reasonable altitude in the sky to be observed effectively. Stars with very high northern declinations are never visible from the Southern Hemisphere. A good rule of thumb for high-quality observations is that the star's declination (DEC) should be within the range of approximately -85° to +35°.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now evaluate each star against two criteria:\n1.  Is it visible from Paranal? (DEC between -85° and +35°)\n2.  Is it bright enough? (`m_V` < 16.5)\n\nTo calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V` from the absolute magnitude `M_V` and distance `d` (in parsecs), we use the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10)`\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude given absolute magnitude and distance in parsecs.\"\"\"\n    # Distance modulus formula: m - M = 5 * log10(d/10)\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc / 10)\n\ndef is_observable(dec_deg):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is practically observable from Paranal Observatory (Latitude ~-24.6 deg).\n    The declination should be roughly in the range [-85, +35] degrees for good observations.\n    \"\"\"\n    return -85 < dec_deg < 35\n\ndef is_bright_enough(m_V):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is bright enough for S/N >= 10 with ESPRESSO in 1-UT mode for 1 hour.\n    From ESO data, a V=16 star gives S/N=12. A V=17 star gives S/N=7.5.\n    The limiting magnitude is therefore between 16 and 17. We can set a cutoff around 16.5 mag.\n    \"\"\"\n    limiting_magnitude = 16.5\n    return m_V < limiting_magnitude\n\n# --- Analysis of each star ---\n\ndetectable_count = 0\nresults = []\n\n# a) Canopus\nm_v_canopus = -0.74\ndec_canopus = -52.7\nobservable_a = is_observable(dec_canopus)\nbright_a = is_bright_enough(m_v_canopus)\nif observable_a and bright_a:\n    detectable_count += 1\nresults.append(f\"a) Canopus: m_V={m_v_canopus:.2f}, DEC={dec_canopus:.1f}.
