    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   Cyclohexanone is a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, ketones undergo halogenation at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   Cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha-carbons, each with two hydrogen atoms. The reaction will substitute one of these hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   2-bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n    *   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a common reaction for α-halo ketones with base. The base abstracts a proton from the alpha-carbon without the halogen (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine, forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed by breaking the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the less substituted carbon of the original ring, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is the salt of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. After workup (which is implied in such problems), this gives the free acid.\n*   **Choosing between elimination and Favorskii:** The subsequent reaction steps are key. The reagents in steps 3 and 4 are standard for converting a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde. This makes the Favorskii rearrangement pathway the most chemically consistent one.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n\n*   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Unlike stronger reagents like LiAlH4, it is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol. This specific reagent choice strongly confirms that Product 3 was an acid chloride.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique proton environments in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n2.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This results in a time-averaged structure that has a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Analysis of Proton Equivalence:**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Methine Proton (on C1):** The single proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Alpha-Protons (on C2 and C5):** The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C5. On C2, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry because C1 is a prochiral center). Let's call them H2a and H2b. Due to the symmetry plane, H2a is equivalent to H5a, and H2b is equivalent to H5b. Therefore, these four alpha-protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n    *   **Beta-Protons (on C3 and C4):** The symmetry plane makes C3 equivalent to C4. Similar to the alpha-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic (H3c, H3d). H3c is equivalent to H4c, and H3d is equivalent to H4d. These four beta-protons also give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine C1) + 2 (alpha-CH₂) + 2 (beta-CH₂) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
