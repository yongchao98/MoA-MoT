    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Compound**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C8H9NO**\n    *   We first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) plus one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons is typical for an **amine group (-NH2)**. The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a **methylene group (-CH2-)**. The doublet multiplicity (d) means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the coupling to the single aldehyde proton from the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group (acetaldehyde group).\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a standard two-step procedure to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (Diazotization): The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt ([Ar-N≡N]+Cl-).\n    *   Step 2 (Hydrolysis): Gently warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt with water causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by an -OH group.\n    *   The product of these first two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   This molecule has both an aldehyde group and α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group), which are the requirements for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Step 3a (Aldol Addition):** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product, which would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Step 3b (Dehydration/Condensation):** The term \"**Heat**\" is crucial. The aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) under heat, especially when it leads to a stable, conjugated system. The loss of the -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   This final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The newly formed C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde group and one of the phenyl rings, making this a very stable final product.\n\n     \n\n**Part 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   The structure of the final product after the aldol condensation (dehydration) is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure, missing OH groups.\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This matches our derived final product.\n    *   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final condensation product expected with heating.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
