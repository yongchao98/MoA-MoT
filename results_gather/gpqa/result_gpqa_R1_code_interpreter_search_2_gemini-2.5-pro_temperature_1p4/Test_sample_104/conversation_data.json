    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario**\n\nWe have a star that rotates. One side (hemisphere) is clear, and the other side has dark spots. This setup causes the star's total observed brightness to change as it rotates.\n*   When the clear side faces us, the star is at its brightest (Maximum Flux, F_max).\n*   When the spotted side faces us, the star is at its dimmest (Minimum Flux, F_min).\n\nWe need to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation. Then, we need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude drop when it transits an otherwise unspotted version of the same star.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Spots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) of a star is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux is proportional to the emitting area (A) and the fourth power of the effective temperature (T): F ∝ A * T⁴.\n\n*   **Star's Properties:**\n    *   Effective Temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Spot Temperature (T_spot) = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling Factor (f) = 20% = 0.20. This is the fraction of the visible disk covered by spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):**\n    This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. The entire visible disk has a temperature of T_eff. Let's denote the area of the star's visible disk as A_star.\n    F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):**\n    This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The visible disk is now a mix of hot photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   Area of spots = f * A_star = 0.20 * A_star\n    *   Area of unspotted photosphere = (1 - f) * A_star = 0.80 * A_star\n    The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.\n    F_min ∝ (Area of unspotted photosphere * T_eff⁴) + (Area of spots * T_spot⁴)\n    F_min ∝ ((1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴) + (f * A_star * T_spot⁴)\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:**\n    The amplitude is the relative change in flux, which is calculated as (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n    Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    Substituting the expressions for F_min and F_max:\n    Amplitude = 1 - [ ((1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴ + f * A_star * T_spot⁴) / (A_star * T_eff⁴) ]\n    We can cancel out A_star from the numerator and denominator:\n    Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ] / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n    Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\n**3. Calculate the Effect of a Transiting Exoplanet**\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip (the signal amplitude) for an unspotted star is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Planet's Radius = R_pl\n*   Star's Radius = R_star\n*   Planet's Area = π * R_pl²\n*   Star's Area = π * R_star²\n*   Transit Depth (Amplitude) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Two Scenarios and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius (relative to the star's radius) that would produce the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the amplitude from the spots equal to the amplitude from the transit.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for R_pl / R_star. We can use a simple python script for the computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star (K)\nT_spot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots (K)\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation caused by the spots\n# This is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law as: f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude for a transiting exoplanet (transit depth) is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal:\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = spot_amplitude\n# So, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.3217912444106318\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) is approximately 0.3218. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks us to equate two physical phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness: rotational modulation due to starspots and a transit by an exoplanet. We need to find the relative size of an exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that produces the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ A * T⁴`, where `A` is the emitting area and `T` is the effective temperature.\n\n*   **Star's Parameters:**\n    *   Effective Temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot Temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   Spot Filling Factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk of the star (with area `A_disk`) radiates at `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` of the disk is covered by cooler spots, and the rest `(1-f)` is at the normal effective temperature.\n    `F_min ∝ [ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ ] + [ f * A_disk * T_spot⁴ ]`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n    `Amplitude_spots = 1 - ( [ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴ ] / [ A_disk * T_eff⁴ ] )`\n\n    We can cancel `A_disk` and simplify:\n    `Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]`\n    `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]`\n    `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Brightness Dip due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen a planet of radius `R_pl` transits a star of radius `R_star`, it blocks a fraction of the star's light. The amplitude of this signal (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### Step 3: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve\n\nThe problem requires the two signals to have the same amplitude.\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]`\n\nUsing the value calculated in Step 1:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root:\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result with the options provided:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated relative radius matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
