    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Define Chemical Species and Equilibria:**\n    The cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`. The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free metal ion and all its complexes.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n4.  **Define the Fraction of the Target Species:**\n    We need to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`. This is represented by its molar fraction, `α2`, multiplied by 100.\n    `Percentage = α2 * 100%`\n    where `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n5.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable:**\n    Using the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n6.  **Derive the Formula for the Molar Fraction (α2):**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 5 into the total cobalt concentration equation (step 3).\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known stability constants and the free ligand concentration:\n    `α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n7.  **Interpret the Given Concentrations:**\n    The problem states `[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M`. In problems of this type, it is standard to assume this refers to the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand, especially since it simplifies the calculation greatly and the provided total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10^-2 M`) is not needed to find the percentage.\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Substitute the given numerical values into the formula for `α2`.\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate each term in the denominator:\n    *   Term 0: `1`\n    *   Term 1: `β1[SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2: `β2[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3: `β3[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4: `β4[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex (Term 2):\n    Numerator = `β2[SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate `α2`:\n    `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n9.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α2 * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value matches option D very closely.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2) is:\n# alpha2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*SCN_conc + beta2*SCN_conc**2 + beta3*SCN_conc**3 + beta4*SCN_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<\n16.91618032648228\n>>>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's define the species present in the solution.
