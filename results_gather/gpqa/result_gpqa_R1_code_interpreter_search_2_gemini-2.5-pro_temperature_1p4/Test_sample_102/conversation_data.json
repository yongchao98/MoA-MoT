    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n- The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group).\n- The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n    - `-COCH3` (acetyl group) at position 1.\n    - `-Br` (bromo group) at position 3.\n    - `-NO2` (nitro group) at position 5.\nThis is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative. All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship with each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n- **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n- **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group and an *ortho,para*-director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests a strategy involving *meta*-directing groups.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Use reinforcing *meta*-directors.**\n    If we place two *meta*-directing groups at positions 1 and 3, they will both direct a third incoming substituent to position 5.\n    Let's try this:\n    a) Start with benzene. Introduce an acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n       `Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone`\n       The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n    b) Introduce a nitro group via nitration.\n       `Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone`\n       The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position. Now we have two *meta*-directors (-COCH3 and -NO2) at positions 1 and 3.\n    c) Introduce a bromo group via bromination.\n       `3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one`\n       Both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) direct the incoming bromine to position 5. The directing effects reinforce, making this step highly regioselective. Although the ring is heavily deactivated, making the reaction slow, it leads directly to the desired product.\n    This sequence is: **Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Another direct route.**\n    a) `Benzene → Acetophenone` (Acylation)\n    b) `Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone` (Bromination, directed *meta* by -COCH3)\n    c) `3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` (Nitration)\n    In this last step, we are nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (m-director at C1) and -Br (o,p-director at C3). The directing effects are conflicting. However, it is known that this reaction can produce the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone as the major product, as position 5 is meta to the strongly deactivating acetyl group.\n    This sequence is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's compare our plausible strategies with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Step `iii` is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which is problematic as the amino group complexes with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring and leading to potential side reactions or failure. This is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    Steps i-iv convert benzene back into benzene (`Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene`). This is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step `iii`) on bromonitrobenzene. Aromatic rings with strong deactivating groups like -NO2 do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions. This pathway is not feasible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ...`\n    Let's analyze the first three steps.\n    `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3`: Benzene → Acetophenone. (Correct)\n    `ii) Br2/FeBr3`: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (Correct, -COCH3 is a *meta*-director).\n    `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. (Correct, this gives the target molecule as the major product, as discussed in Strategy 2).\n\n    This sequence (`Acylation → Bromination → Nitration`) successfully produces the target molecule in the first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option B (`iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2`) are chemically irrelevant and illogical if the target molecule has already been synthesized. It's likely that the question is constructed around the correct initial sequence, and the extra steps are distractors or an error in the question itself.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, the sequence starting with `Acylation → Bromination → Nitration` (the first part of option B) is the most chemically sound and viable route to the target molecule among the choices provided. The other options contain chemically infeasible or nonsensical steps early in their sequences. Therefore, Option B represents the correct reaction sequence, assuming the first three steps are the core of the synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
