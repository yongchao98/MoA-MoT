    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) of a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's analyze the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Understanding Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a specific point `r` and time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `t_r`, called the **retarded time**. The time delay `t - t_r` is exactly the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `r`.\n\nLet's define the key vectors and scalars based on the problem description:\n*   `s(t_r)`: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `r`: The position of the observer (the field point).\n*   `d = r - s(t_r)`: The vector pointing from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`: The distance between the retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_(t=t_r)`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n*   `c`: The speed of light.\n\nThe condition for the retarded time `t_r` is given by the relation:\n`t - t_r = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\nEvaluating these integrals is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electromagnetism. The result of this evaluation yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The standard forms are:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d(1 - (n · v)/c))]`\n\nwhere `n = d / d` is the unit vector in the direction of `d`.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Expressions\n\nLet's simplify the denominator term in the standard formulas:\n`d(1 - (n · v)/c) = d - d * (n · v)/c = d - (d · v)/c`\n\nSo the potentials can be written as:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d · v)/c)]`\n\n### 4. Comparing with the Given Options\n\nNow, let's examine the expressions provided in the options.\n\n*   **Options A and B:** These suggest `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it does not account for retardation effects.\n*   **Option D:** This option has a `+` sign in the denominator: `(dc + d · v)`. This corresponds to \"advanced potentials\", which would mean the effect precedes the cause. These are generally considered unphysical solutions. The condition `t > t_r` implies we are looking for the retarded (causal) solution.\n*   **Option C:**\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))`\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))`\n\nLet's manipulate the denominator of option C to compare it with our standard form:\n`dc - d · v = c * (d - (d · v)/c)`\n\nNow substitute this back into the expressions from Option C:\n*   For `V(r,t)`:\n    `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = q / (4πε₀ (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential.\n\n*   For `A(r,t)`:\n    `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π * c(d - (d · v)/c)) = (μ₀q v) / (4π (d - (d · v)/c))`\n    This matches the standard Liénard-Wiechert vector potential.\n\n### 5. Final Check\n\nAs a consistency check, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by `A = (v/c²)V`. Let's verify this for Option C.\n`A / V = [μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d · v))] / [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v))]`\n`A / V = (μ₀qc v / 4π) * (4πε₀ / qc) = μ₀ε₀v`\nUsing the relation `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we get `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`.\nTherefore, `A / V = v/c²`, which confirms `A = (v/c²)V`.\n\nThe expressions in option C are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials, just written in a slightly different but algebraically equivalent form.\n\n<<<C>>>"
