    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles to solve this are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the decay process and given values:**\n    *   The decay is: Pi(+) → mu(+) + ν (a positive pion decays into a positive muon and a muon neutrino).\n    *   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi(+) (m_π * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu(+) (m_μ * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless (m_ν * c² = 0), which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   To conserve momentum, the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** The pion is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest mass energy.\n        E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Therefore, the conservation of energy equation is:\n        m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by: E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²\n    *   For the **neutrino** (massless, m_ν = 0):\n        E_ν² = (p*c)² + 0  =>  E_ν = p*c\n        Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. So, KE_ν = E_ν.\n    *   For the **muon**:\n        E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    *   We can substitute p*c = E_ν into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n        E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   From the energy conservation equation, we can express E_μ as: E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν.\n    *   Now substitute this expression for E_μ into the previous equation:\n        (m_π * c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        (m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   The E_ν² terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for E_ν (which is KE_ν):\n        (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² = 2*(m_π * c²)*E_ν\n        E_ν = [ (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π * c²) ]\n    *   Now, plug in the given values:\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n        KE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n        **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_μ):**\n    *   The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the final rest mass energies:\n        KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²\n        KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    *   Now, solve for KE_μ:\n        KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        **KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n        *A more precise calculation gives 4.116 MeV, which rounds to 4.12 MeV.*\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
