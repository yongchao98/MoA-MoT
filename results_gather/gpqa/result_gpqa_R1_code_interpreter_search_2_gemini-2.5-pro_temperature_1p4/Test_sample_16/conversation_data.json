    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The problem describes a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as CaY^2-. Although this complex is very stable, it dissociates slightly in solution to establish an equilibrium with its constituent ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA (Y^4-). The reaction for this dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n2.  **Write the chemical equation:**\n    The formation of the complex is: Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY^2-\n    The dissociation of the complex, which is what's happening in our solution, is:\n    CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n3.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d):**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA or K_f, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation reaction.\n    K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\n    The equilibrium we are interested in is the dissociation. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the dissociation constant, K_d. K_d is the inverse of K_f.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2.0 x 10^-11\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species   | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| CaY^2-    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+     | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-      | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) / [CaY^2-]\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    Because the value of K_d is extremely small (2.0 x 10^-11), it indicates that the complex dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows us to make a simplifying assumption to avoid solving a quadratic equation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, substitute this approximation back into the equation:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    x = √(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x = √(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+].\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n    Comparing this result to the given options, it matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The reaction is the dissociation of the complex: CaY^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n# The dissociation constant, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant, Kf.\nKd = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca^2+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-]\n# Let x = [Ca^2+] at equilibrium. From stoichiometry, [Y^4-] = x as well.\n# The concentration of the complex at equilibrium is [CaY^2-] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# The equation is: Kd = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# Since Kd is very small, we can assume x is much smaller than initial_complex_conc, so (initial_complex_conc - x) ≈ initial_complex_conc.\n# The simplified equation is: Kd ≈ x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n# Solving for x:\nx_squared_approx = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx_approx = math.sqrt(x_squared_approx)\n\nprint(f\"The approximate concentration of Ca^2+ is: {x_approx:.2e} M\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms our manual result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in an aqueous solution. The overall process can be summarized with the following steps:\n\n1.  **Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The chemical equation for this equilibrium is:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, which is K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions formed from the dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Since K_d is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches the value provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
