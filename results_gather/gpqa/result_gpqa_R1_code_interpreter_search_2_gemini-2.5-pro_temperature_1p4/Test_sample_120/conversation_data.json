    "**1. Understanding the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa` means the bridging atom (C7) of the cyclopropane is an oxygen, which makes this an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The molecule has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is explicitly given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. This is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Key Principles of the Reaction**\n\nThere are two fundamental rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the epoxide at the carbon atom that is **less sterically hindered**.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-type mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Applying the Principles to the Problem**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is bonded to C2 and C6.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom and is bonded to C1 and C5.\n    *   Comparing the steric hindrance, C6 (bearing a hydrogen) is significantly less hindered than C1 (bearing a methyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from `Me2CuLi` will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the stereochemical outcome (Stereospecificity).**\n    *   The attack occurs at C6 and causes an inversion of its stereochemical configuration.\n    *   The starting material's name tells us that the configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n        *   Configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C3 remains **(R)**.\n        *   Configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring. Attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implicit), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group (the old C1) is designated as C1 in the final product's IUPAC name.\n    *   The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The nucleophilic methyl group added to the old C6. This carbon is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2.\n        *   New C1 corresponds to Old C1.\n        *   New C2 corresponds to Old C6.\n        *   New C4 corresponds to Old C4.\n        *   New C5 corresponds to Old C3.\n    *   The product is named `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This eliminates options C and D which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the final stereochemistry to the product name.**\n    *   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n        *   **C1 (old C1):** Retains its configuration -> **(1R)**\n        *   **C2 (old C6):** Inverts its configuration (S -> R) -> **(2R)**\n        *   **C4 (old C4):** Retains its configuration -> **(4R)**\n        *   **C5 (old C3):** Retains its configuration -> **(5R)**\n    *   Combining these gives the full name of the product: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Our derived name matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
