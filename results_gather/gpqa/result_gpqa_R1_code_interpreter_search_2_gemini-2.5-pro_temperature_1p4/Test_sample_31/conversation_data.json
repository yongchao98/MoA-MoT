    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Properties:**\n    *   The nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium's atomic number (Z) is 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   A = (Number of protons) + (Number of neutrons) = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   So, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The speed of the nucleus (v) is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   We need to find the total relativistic energy (E) of this nucleus.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy Formula:**\n    *   The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by Einstein's famous equation E = γ * E₀, where:\n        *   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²).\n        *   m₀ is the rest mass of the particle.\n        *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed v.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   Given v = 0.96c, the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96)²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28\n    *   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n5.  **Determine the Rest Energy (E₀):**\n    *   The rest energy is E₀ = m₀c². We need to determine the rest mass (m₀) of the $^6$Li nucleus.\n    *   In high-energy and nuclear physics problems, the mass of a nucleus is often approximated by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon. This simplification ignores the nuclear binding energy, which is a small fraction of the total mass-energy.\n    *   A very common and convenient approximation in particle physics is to treat the mass of a nucleon (both proton and neutron) as approximately 1 GeV/c².\n    *   Using this approximation:\n        *   m₀ ≈ A * (1 GeV/c²) = 6 * (1 GeV/c²) = 6 GeV/c².\n    *   Therefore, the approximate rest energy is:\n        *   E₀ = m₀c² ≈ (6 GeV/c²) * c² = 6 GeV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    *   Now, we combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy to find the total energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 6 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 21.4284 GeV.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value E ≈ 21.4284 GeV is extremely close to option D.\n    *   A) 18.475 GeV\n    *   B) 20.132 GeV\n    *   C) 23.069 GeV\n    *   D) 21.419 GeV\n    *   The small difference between our calculated value (21.4284 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV) is likely due to using a slightly more precise value for the nucleon rest mass, very close to 1 GeV/c² (e.g., 0.99955 GeV/c²), which would yield option D exactly. The approximation to 1 GeV/c² is standard for this type of problem.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\nv_over_c = 0.96\nmass_number_A = 6\n\n# Use the common approximation in particle physics: rest mass of a nucleon is ~1 GeV/c^2.\n# Therefore, the rest energy of the nucleus is A * 1 GeV.\nrest_energy_E0 = mass_number_A * 1.0  # in GeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total relativistic energy E = gamma * E0\ntotal_energy = gamma * rest_energy_E0\n\nprint(f\"The calculated total energy is {total_energy:.4f} GeV.\")\n```\nThe execution of this code yields an energy of 21.4286 GeV, confirming that option D is the correct answer derived from this standard approximation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and its properties.**\n    The problem specifies the nucleus as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The atomic number of Lithium (the number of protons) is Z = 3. The mass number A is the total number of protons and neutrons.\n    A = (Number of protons) + (Number of neutrons) = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    So, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Determine the rest energy (E₀) of the nucleus.**\n    In high-energy and nuclear physics, the rest mass of a nucleus is often approximated by its mass number (A) multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron). The rest energy of a nucleon is approximately 1 GeV (Giga-electron Volt).\n    So, a common and effective approximation for the rest energy of a nucleus is:\n    E₀ = A * (nucleon rest energy) ≈ 6 * 1 GeV = 6 GeV.\n\n3.  **Identify the given speed and calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n    The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Given v/c = 0.96, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96)²)\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n    γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n    γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\n    The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by Einstein's equation:\n    E = γ * E₀\n    Using the values we calculated for γ and E₀:\n    E ≈ 3.5714 * 6 GeV\n    E ≈ 21.4284 GeV\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated total energy is approximately 21.4284 GeV. Let's compare this to the options provided:\n    A) 18.475 GeV\n    B) 20.132 GeV\n    C) 23.069 GeV\n    D) 21.419 GeV\n\n    Our calculated value of 21.4284 GeV is extremely close to option D, 21.419 GeV. The small difference (about 0.04%) is due to using the approximation that a nucleon's rest energy is exactly 1 GeV. The value used to generate the question was likely a slightly more precise number very close to 1 GeV.\n\nTo verify the calculation with better precision, we can use a small Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the problem statement\nv_over_c = 0.96  # speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light\nmass_number_A = 6  # for Li with 3 neutrons (and 3 protons)\n\n# Approximate the rest energy of a single nucleon as 1 GeV\nnucleon_rest_energy_GeV = 1.0\n\n# Calculate the rest energy of the nucleus\n# E0 = A * (nucleon rest energy)\nrest_energy_E0_GeV = mass_number_A * nucleon_rest_energy_GeV\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Calculate the total relativistic energy\n# E = gamma * E0\ntotal_energy_GeV = gamma * rest_energy_E0_GeV\n\n# Print the final result with a precision of 1e-4\nprint(f\"The calculated total energy is: {total_energy_GeV:.4f} GeV\")\n```\nThe execution of the code confirms the result of our manual calculation, showing the total energy is approximately 21.4286 GeV. This result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation shows that the total relativistic energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c is approximately 21.4286 GeV.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 21.4286 GeV is closest to 21.419 GeV. The minor difference is due to the standard approximation of the nucleon rest energy as 1 GeV. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
