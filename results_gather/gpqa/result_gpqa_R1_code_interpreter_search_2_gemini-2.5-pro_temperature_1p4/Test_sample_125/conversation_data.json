    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride anion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter in common (S at C5) and one that is different (R vs. S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, as it is used in excess. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The pentane-2,4-diol molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through C3. If the configurations at C2 and C4 are opposite (one R, one S), the molecule is achiral due to this internal symmetry. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** It is reasonable to assume that the products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally and chemically different enough to have distinct retention times and not co-elute by accident.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column**\n\n*   An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all distinct stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture, which contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions, the total number of peaks will be the total number of unique stereoisomers present.\n*   Total number of peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis on the **normal-phase HPLC** predicts **4 peaks**.\n*   The analysis on the **chiral HPLC** predicts **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
