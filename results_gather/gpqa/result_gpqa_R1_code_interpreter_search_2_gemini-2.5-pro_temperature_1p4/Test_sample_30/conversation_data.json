    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. In such problems, we typically assume the major product is carried to the next step. The para isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group at opposite (para) positions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. The reagent MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent, particularly effective for oxidizing benzylic positions. The methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is benzylic. While stronger agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a milder oxidant or controlled conditions can yield an aldehyde (-CHO). For the subsequent reaction in Step 3 to be a standard, well-known reaction, an aldehyde is required. The reaction of an aldehyde with a ketone in the presence of a base (Step 3) is a classic Claisen-Schmidt condensation. If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction in Step 3 would be far less standard. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CHO group and a -NO₂ group at para positions.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). This is a specific type of aldol condensation known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The sodium hydroxide deprotonates the α-carbon of acetone to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This nucleophilic enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The E-isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 3:** 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one (specifically the E-isomer).\n    *   Structure: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** E-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have the identity element.\n    2.  **Planarity:** The molecule has an extended conjugated π-system (nitro group, phenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize orbital overlap and stability, this entire heavy-atom backbone will tend to be planar. Let's assume this planar framework lies in a plane (e.g., the xy-plane).\n    3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):**\n        *   The plane containing the heavy-atom framework (O, N, C atoms) is a potential plane of symmetry.\n        *   The only parts of the molecule that are not necessarily in this plane are the hydrogen atoms of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        *   The methyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is in the plane. For the plane of the heavy atoms to be a true symmetry plane for the entire molecule, the methyl hydrogens must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it. This can be achieved if one C-H bond of the methyl group is eclipsed with the C=O bond (placing this H in the plane), and the other two hydrogens are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. This conformation possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n        *   Therefore, the molecule has at least one plane of symmetry. A molecule whose only symmetry element besides the identity is a single plane of symmetry belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n    4.  **Other Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. The two ends are different (a nitro group vs. a methyl ketone group).\n        *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no proper axis of rotation. A C₂ axis, for example, would require rotating the molecule by 180° to get an identical configuration. No such axis exists due to the asymmetry of the molecule's structure from end to end.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only symmetry element present (other than identity) is a single plane of symmetry (σ). This corresponds to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) C₂h: Incorrect. Requires a C₂ axis.\n*   B) C₃: Incorrect. Requires a C₃ axis.\n*   C) Cₛ: Correct. Requires a single plane of symmetry.\n*   D) D₂h: Incorrect. Requires multiple C₂ axes.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
