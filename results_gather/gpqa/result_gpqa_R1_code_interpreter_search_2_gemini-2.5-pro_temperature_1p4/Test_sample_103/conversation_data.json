    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, its light is redshifted when moving away from us and blueshifted when moving towards us. The amount of wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Semi-amplitude (K):** The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the semi-amplitude, $K$. Since $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ is proportional to $K$, we can find the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the relationship between K and Orbital Period (P):** We need to relate the observable, $K$, to the physical parameters of the system, particularly the orbital period $P$.\n    *   For a star of mass $M_s$ and a planet of mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit, the star moves with a velocity $v_{star}$. The observed semi-amplitude is $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    *   From conservation of momentum, the star's orbital velocity is related to the planet's velocity ($v_p$) by $M_s v_{star} = M_p v_p$ (approximately). So, $v_{star} \\approx v_p \\frac{M_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{P}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n    *   So, $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi a}{P} \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\sin(i)$.\n    *   Next, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate $a$ and $P$: $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s+M_p)} a^3$. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can approximate this as $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM_s} a^3$.\n    *   Solving for $a$: $a \\approx \\left(\\frac{GM_s P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for $a$ into the equation for $K$:\n        $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{P} \\left(\\frac{GM_s P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s}$\n    *   Simplifying this expression gives:\n        $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the relationship to the two systems:** We want to find the ratio $P_2/P_1$. We can set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{s2}^{2/3} P_2^{1/3}} }{ \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{s1}^{2/3} P_1^{1/3}} }$\n\n5.  **Use the given information to simplify the ratio:**\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem does not specify the inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$). In such problems, it's standard to assume similar viewing geometries or that the measured quantity ($M_p \\sin i$, the minimum mass) is what is being compared. In either case, we assume the $M_p \\sin(i)$ term is the same for both.\n    *   With these simplifications, the mass terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the period ratio ($P_2/P_1$):**\n    *   We know $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$.\n    *   So, $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   To find the period ratio, first, we cube both sides:\n        $1.4^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   The question asks for the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We take the reciprocal:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value:**\n```python\n# The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nratio_K = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the period P is K ‚àù P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).\n# We want to find P2/P1.\n# (P2/P1)^(-1/3) = ratio_K\n# P2/P1 = (ratio_K)^(-3) = 1 / (ratio_K^3)\n\nratio_P2_P1 = 1 / (ratio_K**3)\nprint(ratio_P2_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ is approximately 0.3644. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the orbital period of the exoplanets.\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The periodic shift in the wavelength of light from a star ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4 $$\n\n**2. Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) can be expressed by the following formula, assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_s$):\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two planet-star systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}} $$\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio using the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$).\n*   Since no information is given about the orbital inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$), it is standard in such problems to assume they are similar, or that the problem is referring to the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin i$), which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method. We can assume the term $M_p \\sin i$ is approximately the same for both systems.\n\nUnder these assumptions, most terms cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**5. Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the semi-amplitude ratio we calculated in step 1:\n$$ 1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nTo solve for the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ 1.4^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n$$ 2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n\nThe question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
