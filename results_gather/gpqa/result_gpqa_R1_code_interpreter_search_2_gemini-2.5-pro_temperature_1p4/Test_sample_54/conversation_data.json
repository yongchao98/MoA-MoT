    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene or aromatic region of the spectrum. The high value suggests a proton on a double bond (vinylic proton) that is attached to an electron-withdrawing group, such as an oxygen atom.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it is coupled to (adjacent to) only one other non-equivalent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant. For protons on a double bond, a large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* relationship. A smaller J-value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship. This strongly suggests a trans double bond.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic proton region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** The signal is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'd' means it's coupled to one proton (this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm). The 'q' (quartet) means it is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group, -CH3).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), as found in an acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This perfectly matches the structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning the methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Protons**\n\nLet's sum the integrations from the NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\nTotal Protons = 1H (from 7.0 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) = 8 protons.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Structures**\n\nNow, let's compare the proton count with the proposed molecules.\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The chemical formula is C5H8O2. The structure is CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** There are several isomers of butenyl acetate (e.g., but-2-enyl acetate, CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)-CH3). The chemical formula is C6H10O2. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\nBased on the proton count, the unknown compound must be **propenyl acetate**. We can eliminate options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Propenyl Acetate Structure and Determine Stereochemistry**\n\nThe structure is **CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3**. Let's assign the signals:\n*   The singlet at **2.1 ppm (3H)** is the acetate methyl group: -O-C(=O)-**CH3**.\n*   The doublet at **1.6 ppm (3H)** is the methyl group on the double bond: **CH3**-CH=. It's a doublet because it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton.\n*   The proton responsible for splitting the methyl group (at 1.6 ppm) into a doublet must be the one at **5.5 ppm (1H)**. This proton (=CH-CH3) is also coupled to the other vinyl proton, hence its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   The proton at **7.0 ppm (1H)** is the other vinyl proton (-O-CH=). It's far downfield due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. It is a doublet because it's only coupled to the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\nThe coupling constant between these two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**. As established in Step 1, this large value is definitive for a **trans** configuration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data indicates:\n1.  The molecule has 8 protons, consistent with propenyl acetate.\n2.  The molecular fragments (acetate, methyl-substituted double bond) match propenyl acetate.\n3.  The J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons confirms a trans geometry.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
