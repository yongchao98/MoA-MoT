    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial and final states of the system.**\n    *   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is zero.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are moving, so they have both rest-mass energy and kinetic energy. Let their kinetic energies be `T1` and `T2`, and their momenta be `p1` and `p2`.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the rest masses of the fragments.**\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   We are also given that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n        `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n        `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n        `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   Now find `m1`:\n        `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n    *   We can express the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n        `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n        `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    *   The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    *   `300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n    *   `300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n    *   This gives the total kinetic energy released (Q-value): `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of momentum.**\n    *   The initial momentum is zero. The final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = 0`, which means the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n        `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n        `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n    *   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n        `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\n    *   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   So, `T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`, which means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Now use the total kinetic energy:\n        `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n        `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n        `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n        `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n6.  **Calculate T1 using the correct (relativistic) formula.**\n    *   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy `E` is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    *   From this, we can derive an expression for momentum squared: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Since `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n    *   We know `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n        `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n        `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   Now, solve for T1:\n        `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n        `600 * T1 = 603`\n        `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n7.  **Find the difference between the two values of T1.**\n    *   Correct (relativistic) value: `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   Approximate (classical) value: `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\n8.  **Convert the difference to the required units (MeV).**\n    *   Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    *   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\nThe calculation is confirmed by the following python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants from the problem\n# All energy units are in GeV\nm1c2 = 198  # Rest-mass energy of fragment 1\nm2c2 = 99   # Rest-mass energy of fragment 2\nQ = 3       # Total kinetic energy T1 + T2\n\n# Relativistic calculation\n# Equation: T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# where T2 = Q - T1\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2\n# 2*T1*m1c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + 2*Q*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2\n# T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2c2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2\n# Note: The manual algebraic simplification in the reasoning was simpler.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`, and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given the following relations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nWe can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\nSubstitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n`m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe fission process must conserve energy and momentum.\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is `E_initial = 300 GeV`.\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the two fragments: `E_final = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`, where `T1` and `T2` are the kinetic energies.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\nThe total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero. The final momentum must also be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n`p1 + p2 = 0` => `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nNow, we calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using both classical and relativistic mechanics.\n\n**1. Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation:**\nThe classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\nTherefore, `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\nThis shows that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2` => `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**2. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation:**\nThe relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSo, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, their `(p*c)^2` values are equal:\n`(p1*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n`(p2*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\nEquating them:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\nSubstitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396 * T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396 * T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600 * T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Difference Calculation:**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>"
