    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:** The number of particles, `N`, that remain after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` follows the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    Here, `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the observer's reference frame* (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** The mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is dilated with respect to the particle's proper mean lifetime `τ` (the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `T = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `d` of 30 meters. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall, `t_flight`, is:\n    `t_flight = d / v ≈ d / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas:** We can substitute the expressions for `T` and `t_flight` into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles (`N / N₀`) that survive to reach the detector:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / T) = exp(-(d / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    Let's group the constant terms for this specific particle and detector setup: `k = d / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition to Find `k`:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `Fraction₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Use the Second Condition to Find the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   `Fraction₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -k / ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = -k / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = k / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 5 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 based on the derived formula:\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>\n>54.185114742461936\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 68\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, surviving after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is dilated with respect to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) due to its high velocity. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance `d = 30 m`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ d / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-(d/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n    We can group the constants `d`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `k = d / (c * τ)`, as they do not change between the two scenarios. The equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the First Scenario to find k:** We are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    To solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Use the Second Scenario to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):** We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival fraction of `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -k / ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = -k / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = k / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Now, substitute the expression for `k` from step 5 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n    Using the output from the code execution:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n    This value is closest to the option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
