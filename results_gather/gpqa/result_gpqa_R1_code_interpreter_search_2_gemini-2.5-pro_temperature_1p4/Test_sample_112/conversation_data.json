    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is a hallmark of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning it contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this m/z value is the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺. Let's confirm its mass.\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses: C ≈ 12, O ≈ 16, H ≈ 1\n    # Mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]+\n    mass_of_COOH = 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01\n    print(mass_of_COOH)\n    ```\n    The calculated mass is 45.02, which matches the observed fragment peak. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have definitively identified two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C6H12O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n            This molecule has one degree of unsaturation. The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for this single degree. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid) and does not have room for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:**\n            DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n            This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and the C=C bond in the alkene (1 DoU).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid and an alkene group is confirmed by all three characterisation techniques. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that provides the required two oxygen atoms and the necessary two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both functional groups.\n\n<<<D>>>"
