    "1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona-\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl-\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The condition is \"heated,\" which suggests a thermal reaction.\n\n2.  **Draw the Structure of the Starting Material:**\n    Let's draw the 9-carbon chain and add the functional groups:\n    `C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7-C8-C9`\n    Add the butyl group at C5.\n    Add hydrogens to satisfy the valency of each carbon:\n    `CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)`\n    The substituent on C5 is a butyl group. The chain ending at C9 is from an ethyl group attached to the C7 of the diene system. Let's draw it showing the substituents more clearly.\n\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n                      `|`\n                      `CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (Butyl group)`\n\n3.  **Identify the Type of Reaction:**\n    The starting material, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, has a `C=C-C-C-C=C` structural motif. This is a 1,5-diene system. When a 1,5-diene is heated, it undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Perform the Cope Rearrangement:**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves the breaking of the C-C single bond between the two allyl systems and the formation of a new C-C single bond between the ends of the two systems. The double bonds also shift.\n    Let's number the six carbons of the 1,5-diene system that are involved in the rearrangement. The system is `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`.\n\n    *   Numbering for the rearrangement mechanism:\n        `C(2)=C(3)-C(4) --- C(5)-C(6)=C(7)`\n          `1    2    3         3'   2'   1'`\n        No, the standard numbering for the [3,3] sigmatropic shift is across the sigma bond that breaks. The C4-C5 bond is the one that breaks.\n        Let's label the atoms of the two rearranging allyl fragments:\n        *   Allyl fragment 1: `C(2)=C(3)-C(4)`\n        *   Allyl fragment 2: `C(7)=C(6)-C(5)`\n\n    The rearrangement involves these changes:\n    *   The **C(4)-C(5) sigma bond breaks**.\n    *   A **new C(2)-C(7) sigma bond forms**.\n    *   The pi bond from **C(2)=C(3) moves to C(3)=C(4)**.\n    *   The pi bond from **C(6)=C(7) moves to C(5)=C6)**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the carbon skeleton in the product. We can think of the product as being formed by connecting the following fragments:\n    *   Fragment A (from original C1, C2, C3, C4): `CH₃-CH(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)`\n    *   Fragment B (from original C5, C6, C7, C8, C9 and the butyl group): `(C₄H₉)-CH(5)=CH(6)-CH(7)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   These fragments are joined by the new C(2)-C(7) single bond.\n\n    Let's combine them to draw the final product structure:\n                     `CH₃`\n                      `|`\n    `CH₂=CH - CH - CH - CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`\n                 `(C4,C3)``(C2)``(C7)` `(C6,C5)`     `(Butyl group)`\n                             `|`\n                             `CH₂-CH₃ (Ethyl group)`\n\n6.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature:**\n    *   **Find the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain that contains the maximum number of principal functional groups (the two double bonds).\n        The chain starting from the `CH₂=` end (original C4) and going through the butyl group is the longest chain containing both double bonds.\n        `C(1)H₂=C(2)H-C(3)H-C(4)H-C(5)H=C(6)H-C(7)H₂-C(8)H₂-C(9)H₂-C(10)H₃`\n        This is a 10-carbon chain, so the parent name is **deca-**.\n    *   **Locate the double bonds:** We number the chain from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Numbering from left to right (as drawn above): The double bonds start at C1 and C5. The locant set is {1, 5}.\n        *   Numbering from right to left: The double bonds start at C5 and C9. The locant set is {5, 9}.\n        *   Comparing {1, 5} and {5, 9}, the first set is lower. So, we number from the left.\n        The name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Identify and locate substituents:**\n        *   At C3, there is a methyl group (`-CH₃`, the original C1).\n        *   At C4, there is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`, the original C8-C9 group).\n    *   **Assemble the full name:** List the substituents alphabetically.\n        `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene - This matches our derived name.\n    *   B) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect chain length and locants.\n    *   C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect substituent and double bond locants.\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - Same as C.\n\nThe correct product is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
