    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** \n    1.  mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid)\n    2.  Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)\n*   **Process:** This is a two-step process for the anti-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n    *   **Step 1.1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a stereospecific *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The addition of the oxygen atom can occur from either face of the double bond with equal probability.\n        *   This results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Specifically, a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane is produced.\n    *   **Step 1.2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (S_N2-type) attack by a water molecule. This results in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups relative to each other.\n        *   The ring-opening of the racemic mixture of trans-epoxides via an *anti*-attack mechanism leads to a single product.\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide → *anti*-opening → (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide → *anti*-opening → (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This compound has two chiral centers but also possesses a center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry in certain conformations), making it a *meso* compound. It is achiral.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Process:** This is also an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Step 2.1: Epoxidation.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to the (Z)-alkene results in a cis-epoxide.\n        *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral and has a plane of symmetry. Addition of oxygen from either face results in the same single product: meso-cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, also known as (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2.2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *anti*-attack of water on the meso-epoxide will lead to a racemic mixture.\n        *   Attack at carbon C4 inverts its configuration (R→S), while C5 remains S, yielding (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at carbon C5 inverts its configuration (S→R), while C4 remains R, yielding (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The two carbons are enantiotopic, so attack at either is equally probable.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus different polarities. They will elute at different times and show separate peaks. So, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Total number of observed peaks = **2**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also separated.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Total number of observed peaks = **3**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
