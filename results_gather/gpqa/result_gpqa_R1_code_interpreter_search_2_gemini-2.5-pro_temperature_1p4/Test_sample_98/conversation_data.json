    "**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   A set of 3 protons (n=3, gives n+1 = 4 lines, a quartet)\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   Another set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the structure that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(e) (1H) and the CH2 group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the terminal CH3 group (3H), and its own attached CH3 group (3H). This would be a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option C: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(d)- CH(c)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(c):** Coupled to H(d) (1H). It would be a doublet (ignoring coupling to COOH).\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H) and the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n             Et    Et\n             |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(e)- CH(d)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the CH2 of its own ethyl group (2H), and the CH2 of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Let's check for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires coupling to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. There is no proton in this molecule that fits this description. For example, the methylene (`CH2`) protons of the ethyl groups are coupled to a methine (`CH`, 1H) and a methyl (`CH3`, 3H). This would result in a doublet of quartets (`dq`), complicated by diastereotopicity (which would add another doublet coupling, making it a `ddq`).\n    *   This structure has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          Et    Et\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons, H(d) and H(e).\n    *   **Proton H(d):** This proton is on carbon-3.\n        *   It is adjacent to H(e) on carbon-4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group on carbon-2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The combined signal for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is on carbon-4.\n        *   It is adjacent to H(d) on carbon-3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the terminal CH3 group on carbon-5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The combined signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and another proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
