    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay (cascade decay) of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. This happens via an intermediate state. The decay mechanism is the electric dipole transition.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** For an atom to transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'> by emitting or absorbing a single photon (electric dipole transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n    *   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n_i, l_i, m_i>.\n    *   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n_i, l_i, m_i>**\n        *   Initial state: |n=3, l=0, m=0>.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = l_i - l = l_i - 0 = ±1. Since l must be non-negative, l_i = 1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m_i - m = m_i - 0 = 0, ±1. So, m_i can be -1, 0, or 1.\n        *   For a decay, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n_i < 3. The most common spontaneous emission is to the next lowest possible energy level, so we assume n_i = 2.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These are the three sub-levels of the 2p orbital.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: |n_i, l_i, m_i> → |1,0,0>**\n        *   Final state: |n'=1, l'=0, m'=0>.\n        *   Let's check if transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed.\n        *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m_i> where m_i ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: Δl = l' - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - m_i = 0 - m_i. For the transition to be allowed, Δm must be 0, ±1. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of m_i (-1, 0, 1).\n        *   Therefore, all three paths are possible:\n            *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n            *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n            *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay channel. The overall probability is determined by the first step of the transition, as the second step (|2p> -> |1s>) is the only allowed dipole decay from the 2p state and thus has a probability of 1 (assuming it's the only decay channel, which is true for electric dipole transitions).\n\n    We need to find the relative probabilities of the three possible first transitions: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m_i>.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state (l=0). This state is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   When a spherically symmetric system decays, it must decay into the available final states with equal probability, as there is no physical reason to prefer one orientation (m_i value) over another.\n    *   This is a fundamental consequence of rotational symmetry and the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from an unpolarized state with angular momentum `j` to a set of states with angular momentum `j'` is distributed among the `m'` sub-levels in a way that depends on the initial polarization. For an unpolarized or spherically symmetric (j=0) initial state, all final `m'` sub-levels are populated equally.\n    *   In our case, the atom decays from l=0 to l=1. The l=1 state has three magnetic sub-levels (m_i = -1, 0, 1). Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning into each of these sub-levels are equal.\n    *   Since there are three possible paths and their probabilities must sum to 1, the probability for each path is 1/3.\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability of the Full Cascade:**\n    The problem asks for the probability of the specific route:\n    |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n\n    The total probability of this route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    P(Route) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n    *   We found P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3.\n    *   Once the atom is in the |2,1,0> state, it will decay. The only lower energy state accessible via a single dipole transition is the |1,0,0> state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   P(Route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and P = 2/3\n    *   B) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and P = 1/4\n    *   C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and P = 1/4\n    *   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and P = 1/3\n\n    Our calculated route and probability match option D. The route is allowed by selection rules, and its probability is 1/3.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe transition from the |3,0,0\\rangle state to the |1,0,0\\rangle state occurs via a two-step dipole transition through an intermediate state.\n1.  **First transition:** |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle. According to dipole selection rules, \\Delta l = \\pm 1, so l'=1. \\Delta m=0, \\pm 1, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1. The most likely decay is to n'=2. Thus, the intermediate states are |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, and |2,1,-1\\rangle.\n2.  **Second transition:** |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle. For this transition, \\Delta l = 0-1 = -1 and \\Delta m = 0-m', which are allowed for all m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}.\n3.  **Probability:** The initial state |3,0,0\\rangle is spherically symmetric (l=0). Therefore, when it decays, it populates the three magnetic sub-levels of the l=1 state (|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle) with equal probability. As there are three possible channels for the first step, the probability (branching ratio) for each is \\frac{1}{3}.\nThe probability for the specific cascade |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle is determined by the probability of the first step, which is \\frac{1}{3}, since the second step is the only subsequent dipole decay path.\nThus, the route is |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and the corresponding probability is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\n<<<D>>>"
