    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n    $H\\psi = E\\psi$\n    where the Hamiltonian operator $H$ is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(r) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\n    This Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i = x, y, z$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    The total energy $E$ of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n=0, 1, 2, 3, ...$). The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\n4.  **Identify the Energy of the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is when $n=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. We need to find the number of ways to write $n=3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ for $n=3$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  -->  **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  -->  **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1)  -->  **1 state**\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n    A general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$. This confirms our counting.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   Energy of the third excited state: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n    C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n    D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\n    Options C and D show an energy expression characteristic of a particle in a spherical box, which is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator. Option A has the correct energy but the wrong degeneracy. Option B has both the correct energy and the correct degeneracy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
