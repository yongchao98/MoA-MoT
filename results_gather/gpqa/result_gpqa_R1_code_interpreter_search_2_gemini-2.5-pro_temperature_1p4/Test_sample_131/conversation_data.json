    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration for each of the four options. The key is to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has high symmetry (D2h point group), with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (C2v point group) that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet** (as they are an AA' system), integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry (C1 point group). It is asymmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 3, and 5) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **four distinct singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h), similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal for the ethyl groups will be split. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will give a **quartet** (4H). The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will give a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), and 1 aliphatic triplet (6H). This compound can be immediately ruled out because the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, we simulate the spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of the pairs given in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1s, 2H) + Isodurene (2s, 1H each). Total = **3 signals** with a ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed 2 signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1s, 2H) + Isodurene (2s, 1H each). Total = **3 signals** with a ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one singlet for 2H. Prehnitene gives one singlet for 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** (assuming slightly different chemical shifts), each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** in total. The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in its aliphatic region.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum matches the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
