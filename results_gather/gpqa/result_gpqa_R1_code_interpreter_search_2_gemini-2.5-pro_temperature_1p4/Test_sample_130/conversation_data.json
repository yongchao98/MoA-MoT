    "**1. Deconstruction of the problem:**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift is in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C=O). The presence of only two signals indicates high molecular symmetry.\n    *   These spectral data and the formation from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid uniquely identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (hence one ¹H signal) and, by symmetry, two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (hence two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** A Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product matches the one given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the thermodynamically more stable (minor) product as it is sterically less hindered.\n\n*   **Products & Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows a cross-peak (indicating spatial proximity, < 5Å) in the major product that is absent or very weak in the minor product. We need to identify the protons responsible for this cross-peak.\n\n**2. Structural Analysis of Products:**\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. Let's analyze the proton signals we expect from the product's structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry:\n*   **H_α protons (2H singlet):** These are the two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the product. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyl groups (~1.5-2.0 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their shift will be further upfield (~1.0-1.5 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Methylene bridge protons (CH₂, two 1H signals):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are not equivalent and should appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**3. NOESY Analysis (Spatial Proximity):**\n\nWe are looking for protons that are close in space in the *endo* (major) product but far apart in the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\" or \"under\") the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are spatially close to the **Me_vinyl groups**. This will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also close to the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will also generate an NOESY cross-peak.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\" or \"above\") of the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are far from the **Me_vinyl groups**. The NOESY cross-peak will be absent.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also far from the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This NOESY cross-peak will also be absent.\n\n**4. Matching Analysis to Options:**\n\nThe question describes a cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product. Based on our analysis, two such interactions exist:\n1.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n2.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and the ***anti*-bridge proton** (~1.5 ppm, 1H doublet).\n\nThese correspond to options B and A, respectively.\n*   **Option B:** A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n*   **Option A:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one of the bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n\nWhile both cross-peaks are valid markers for the *endo* isomer, the interaction between the H_α protons of the dienophile and the vinylic methyl groups of the diene is the most direct and classic evidence of the *endo* stereochemistry. Furthermore, the NOE signal intensity depends on the number of interacting protons. The interaction in Option B involves a group of 6 protons and a group of 2 protons, which would typically result in a stronger, more prominent cross-peak than the interaction in Option A (1 proton and 2 protons). Therefore, it is the most likely candidate for \"the\" characteristic cross-peak mentioned in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
