    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemical equilibrium problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main objective is to determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-, in the given solution.\n\n**2. Analyze the Components of the Solution:**\n*   **Solvent:** Water (implied).\n*   **Volume:** 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.20000 L.\n*   **Solute 1:** 1.00 g of KH2PO4 (Potassium dihydrogen phosphate). Its molar mass (Mw) is 136.09 g/mol. In solution, this salt dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- ions.\n*   **Solute 2:** 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O (Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate). Its molar mass (Mw) is 177.99 g/mol. In solution, this salt dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2H2O.\n*   **Phosphoric Acid Dissociation Constants:**\n    *   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- ; Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3\n    *   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n    *   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\n**3. Identify the Key Chemical System:**\nThe solution contains significant amounts of H2PO4- (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, HPO4^2-. This mixture constitutes a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (governed by Ka2)\n\nThe species we need to find, PO4^3-, is formed from the third dissociation:\nHPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (governed by Ka3)\n\n**4. Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan:**\n\n*   **Step A:** Calculate the initial number of moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- from the given masses.\n*   **Step B:** Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- in the 200.00 mL solution.\n*   **Step C:** Use the equilibrium expression for Ka2 to find the equilibrium concentration of H+.\n*   **Step D:** Use the equilibrium expression for Ka3, along with the concentrations calculated in the previous steps, to find the equilibrium concentration of PO4^3-.\n\n**5. Execute the Plan (with Calculations):**\n\nI will use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n*   **Step A & B: Moles and Initial Concentrations**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles. This gives 0.007348 moles of H2PO4-.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles. This gives 0.005618 moles of HPO4^2-.\n    *   Initial [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate [H+]**\n    *   From the second dissociation: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Since Ka2 and Ka3 are very small, the change in the initial concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- to establish equilibrium is negligible. We can use their initial concentrations as their equilibrium concentrations in this step.\n    *   [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate [PO4^3-]**\n    *   From the third dissociation: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearranging for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We can now substitute the expression for [H+] from Step C into this equation.\n    *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / (Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]))\n    *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]^2 / (Ka2 * [H2PO4-])\n\nLet's use a script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.20000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step A: Moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step B: Initial Concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step C: Calculate [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step D: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# The result is the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-)\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their initial concentrations:**\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of each substance added to the solution.\n- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n- Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\nKH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H₂PO₄⁻.\nNa₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻.\n\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 200.00 mL or 0.20000 L.\n\nWe can calculate the initial molar concentrations of the phosphate species:\n- [H₂PO₄⁻] = (Moles of KH₂PO₄) / Volume\n- [HPO₄²⁻] = (Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) / Volume\n\n**2. Determine the controlling equilibrium:**\nThe solution contains a conjugate acid-base pair: H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). This constitutes a buffer. The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻      (Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n\nFrom this equilibrium, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n**3. Calculate the target ion concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is produced from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻      (Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nBy substituting the [H⁺] we found in step 2, and using the initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ (since they are part of a buffer and their concentrations will not change significantly), we can find the final answer.\n\nLet's perform the precise calculation using a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.20000  # in Liters\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of the phosphate species\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the phosphate species\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions is {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and the Python code provided in the previous step correctly outline the method to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:** The code first calculates the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ from their respective masses and molar masses. Then, it divides by the volume (0.20000 L) to get the initial concentrations of the buffer components.\n    -   `conc_h2po4_minus` = [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    -   `conc_hpo4_2minus` = [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n2.  **Calculate [H⁺]:** The solution is a buffer dominated by the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    The code correctly rearranges this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    `conc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)`\n\n3.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:** The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation, which is governed by Ka₃:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    The code correctly rearranges this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    `conc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)`\n\nThe executed code provides the final result based on these calculations.\n\n**Code Output:**\n`The concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24e-07 M`\n\nThis calculated value, 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
