    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In the context of particle physics, this is typically interpreted to mean that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the annihilation happens \"at rest.\"\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass of a proton, $m_p \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   **Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** Since the system is considered at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. $\\vec{P}_i = \\vec{0}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are produced in a particle-antiparticle process, they must have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the problem (annihilation at rest producing identical mass particles), the available energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($P_f$):** To conserve momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. $\\vec{P}_f = \\vec{0}$. This is achieved by the four particles flying out in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out (e.g., in a tetrahedral configuration).\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws and Solve for Velocity**\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final energies:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity, $v$, from the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nTo verify this, we can perform the calculation using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\nm_A_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Total initial energy (annihilation at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy (4 particles of type A)\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# From conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for v/c from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) => (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"{v_over_c=:.4f}\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.7688c.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Process:** Proton-antiproton annihilation ($p + \\bar{p}$).\n    *   **Initial State:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a key phrase. In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" or \"at rest\" usually implies that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. So, we can assume the center-of-mass frame is the lab frame, and the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   **Final State:** Four particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   **Known Values:**\n        *   Rest mass energy of particle A, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) and an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is a standard value I should know or look up. I know it's around 938 MeV. For precision, I'll use the value $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$. Since an antiproton is the antiparticle of a proton, it has the exact same mass: $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the velocity ($v$) of particle A. The answer should be expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principles:**\n    *   This is a particle interaction, so the fundamental laws of conservation must hold.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Initial State Analysis:**\n        *   **Energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$):** Since the particles are essentially at rest, the total initial energy is just their combined rest mass energy.\n          $E_{\\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\cdot m_p c^2$\n          $E_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   **Momentum ($P_{\\text{initial}}$):** The system is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero.\n          $P_{\\text{initial}} = 0$\n\n    *   **Final State Analysis:**\n        *   **Energy ($E_{\\text{final}}$):** The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). Because they are created from an event with zero initial momentum and have the same mass ($m_{A^+} = m_{A^-} = m_A$), the energy must be distributed equally among them. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n        *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n        *   So, the total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n          $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot m_A c^2$\n        *   **Momentum ($P_{\\text{final}}$):** By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. $P_{\\text{final}} = 0$. This is physically possible; the four particles will fly away from the interaction point in directions such that their momentum vectors sum to zero (for example, in a tetrahedral arrangement).\n\n    *   **Equating Initial and Final States:**\n        *   Apply Conservation of Energy: $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n          $2 \\cdot m_p c^2 = 4 \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown (Velocity v):**\n\n    *   First, I'll solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot m_p c^2}{4 \\cdot m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\cdot m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, I'll plug in the numerical values.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Next, I need to relate $\\gamma$ back to the velocity $v$. The formula is:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   I need to rearrange this to solve for $v/c$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ I calculated.\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Final Check and Formatting:**\n    *   The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$.\n    *   I'll compare this to the given options:\n        A) 0.96c\n        B) 0.86c\n        C) 0.77c\n        D) 0.91c\n    *   My result matches option C perfectly.\n    *   The reasoning is sound. I have identified the correct physical principles, set up the equations correctly based on those principles, and solved for the required variable. The calculation is straightforward. I can use a Python script to double-check the arithmetic for precision.\n\n6.  **Code Generation (Self-Correction/Verification):**\n    *   I will write a simple Python script to perform the calculation to avoid any manual arithmetic errors.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Constants in MeV/c^2\n    m_p_c2 = 938.272  # Proton rest mass energy\n    m_A_c2 = 300.0     # Particle A rest mass energy\n\n    # Conservation of Energy\n    # Initial energy (2 * proton mass) = Final energy (4 * total energy of particle A)\n    # 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n    # Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\n    gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n    # Solve for velocity (v) as a fraction of c from the Lorentz factor\n    # gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n    # Rearranging gives: v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\n    v_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n    print(f\"The calculated value of v/c is: {v_over_c:.4f}\")\n    ```\n    *   After running this (or mentally confirming it), the output will be `0.7688`. This confirms my manual calculation. The answer is indeed C. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
