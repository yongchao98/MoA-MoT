    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n### **1. Observational Constraints**\n\nFirst, let's establish the combined constraints for a star to be observable by both spectrographs.\n\n**a) Location (Declination):**\n*   The HIRES spectrograph is at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ +20° N). It can observe stars with a declination (DEC) greater than approximately -70°.\n*   The ESPRESSO spectrograph is at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ -25° S). It can observe stars with a declination less than approximately +65°.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be in the range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n*   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16).\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17).\n*   To be observed by *both*, a star must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, the apparent V magnitude must be **m_V < 16**.\n\n### **2. Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nWe will now apply these two constraints to each star. We will use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) when only the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given:\n\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc) + A_V`\n\nWhere:\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the interstellar absorption in the V band. `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's write a python code to do the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star_observability(star_name, dec, Mv=None, mv=None, dist_pc=None, ebv=0.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both HIRES and ESPRESSO.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (bool, str) where bool is True if observable, and str is the reason.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Location Check\n    if not (-70 < dec < 65):\n        return False, f\"{star_name}: Not observable by both.

    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis for each star:\n\n**Observability Criteria:**\nFor a star to be detectable by *both* observatories, it must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Location:** Its declination (DEC) must be visible from both the Northern Hemisphere (Keck, Hawaii) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal, Chile). This generally means the star's declination must be between approximately -70° and +65°.\n2.  **Brightness:** Its apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than the limit of the less sensitive instrument. HIRES requires m_V < 16, and ESPRESSO requires m_V < 17. Therefore, the combined requirement is **m_V < 16**.\n\n**Calculations:**\nWe use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and absorption (A_V):\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n**Analysis of Each Star:**\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range (-70° to +65°), as it is too far south for Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 55°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as m_V = 16.5. This does not meet the brightness requirement of m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as m_V = 15.5. This meets the brightness requirement of m_V < 16. The extinction value is extra information not needed for the final brightness check.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n        *   distance (d) = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This does not meet the brightness requirement of m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n        *   distance (d) = 5 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 0 (since E(B-V) is not given, it's assumed to be 0)\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This meets the brightness requirement of m_V < 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Observable by both.\n\n**Final Result:**\nThe stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
