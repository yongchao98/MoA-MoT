    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The question asks for the synthesis of \"1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". Let's break down this IUPAC name:\n    *   **Parent chain:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a `–CHO` (aldehyde) group attached.\n    *   **Substituent location:** `1-`. The substituent is on carbon-1 of the cyclohexane ring. By convention, the carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (the aldehyde) is C-1.\n    *   **Substituent structure:** `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This is a methyl group (`-CH<`) that is also attached to a hydroxy group (`-OH`) and a cyclohexyl group (`-C₆H₁₁`). The full substituent is `-CH(OH)C₆H₁₁`.\n\n    If we try to construct this molecule, we have C-1 of the main cyclohexane ring bonded to:\n    a. C-2 of the ring\n    b. C-6 of the ring\n    c. The `-CHO` group\n    d. The `-CH(OH)C₆H₁₁` group\n\n    This would require C-1 to have five bonds, which is impossible for a carbon atom. Therefore, the name of the target molecule as written is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Goal:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** `ethynylcyclohexane` (C₆H₁₁-C≡CH). This molecule has 8 carbon atoms and one cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **The incorrectly named product** would have two cyclohexane rings and a total of 14 carbon atoms (C₆H₁₀ ring + CHO + CH(OH)C₆H₁₁).\n    *   The discrepancy (starting with one ring and ending with two) and the impossible structure of the named product strongly suggest there is a typo in the question's target molecule name. A common scenario in such problems is that one of the reaction pathways provided is chemically sound and leads to a plausible product, and that is the intended answer.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences:**\n\n    *   **Starting Step:** All options begin with `NaNH₂`. This is a strong base used to deprotonate the terminal alkyne (`ethynylcyclohexane`) to form a sodium acetylide salt (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺`). This is a standard and correct first step for elongating the carbon chain.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `1. NaNH₂, methanol` `2. Li/liq. NH₃` `3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S` `4. NH₄OH`\n        - Step 1: Adding methanol (`CH₃OH`), a protic solvent, would simply protonate the acetylide anion, regenerating the starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This sequence of reagents does not lead to a new product. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride` `2. Li/liq. NH₃` `3. O₃/ H₂O` `4. NH₄OH`\n        - Step 1: `C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺` + `CH₃CH₂Cl` → `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃` (1-cyclohexyl-1-butyne). This is a valid SN2 reaction.\n        - Step 2: `Li/liq. NH₃` reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene: *trans*-`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`.\n        - Step 3: Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (`H₂O`) cleaves the alkene and oxidizes the resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids: `C₆H₁₁-COOH` (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) and `CH₃CH₂-COOH` (propanoic acid).\n        - Step 4: `NH₄OH` is a base and would just form the ammonium salts of the carboxylic acids. This does not produce the target hydroxy aldehyde. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride` `2. H₂/Pd` `3. Ba(OH)₂` `3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O`\n        - This option has numbering errors and a chemically illogical sequence.\n        - Step 1: `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃` (1-cyclohexylpropyne).\n        - Step 2: `H₂/Pd` is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane: `C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃` (propylcyclohexane).\n        - Subsequent steps like `Ba(OH)₂` (a base) or `H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O` (alkyne hydration reagents) would have no reaction with the saturated alkane. The sequence is nonsensical. So, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride` `2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` `3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S` `4. Ba(OH)₂`\n        - Step 1: `NaNH₂` + `CH₃Cl` alkylates the alkyne to form `C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃` (1-cyclohexylpropyne). This is correct.\n        - Step 2: `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) is used for the partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene: *cis*-`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`. This is correct.\n        - Step 3: `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S` is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond to form two aldehydes: `C₆H₁₁-CHO` (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and `CH₃CHO` (acetaldehyde). This is correct.\n        - Step 4: `Ba(OH)₂` is a base that will catalyze an aldol reaction between the two aldehydes. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and cannot form an enolate. Acetaldehyde does have α-hydrogens. Therefore, a crossed-aldol addition will occur where the enolate of acetaldehyde attacks the carbonyl of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n        - The reaction is: `C₆H₁₁-CHO + ⁻CH₂CHO → C₆H₁₁-CH(O⁻)-CH₂CHO`, which after protonation gives `C₆H₁₁-CH(OH)-CH₂CHO`.\n        - The product is **3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal**. This is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, a classic aldol addition product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction sequence in option C is chemically sound and leads to a specific, plausible product (3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal). The other options contain significant chemical errors. The name in the question is incorrect, but the reaction path in C is the only valid synthesis among the choices. Thus, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
