    "My reasoning process to solve this multi-step synthesis problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1: Formation of Product 1.**\n    *   **Reactant A:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative. It has two double bonds and is a classic dienophile for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   **Reactant B Precursor:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is combined with sodium iodide (NaI). This reaction, involving a gem-dihalide and NaI, is a known method for generating reactive intermediates. Based on related preparations (e.g., from 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene), the most plausible reactive intermediate generated here is **o-quinodimethane** (also known as o-xylylene). This species is a highly reactive diene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the o-quinodimethane precursor are used. This strongly implies that the generated o-quinodimethane reacts with both double bonds of reactant A in a **double Diels-Alder reaction**. The addition typically occurs on the less sterically hindered *exo* face of the norbornadiene system.\n    *   **Product 1:** A large, symmetrical molecule formed from the double cycloaddition, with a tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the bridge (C7).\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** These are standard acidic conditions for the cleavage (deprotection) of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Product 2:** The same polycyclic skeleton as Product 1, but with an alcohol (-OH) at position C7. The overall symmetry is maintained.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents constitutes the **Parikh-Doering oxidation**. It is a mild method for oxidizing alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n    *   **Product 3:** The same symmetrical polycyclic skeleton, but with a carbonyl group at C7.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4.**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C. The Diels-Alder reaction is reversible, and heating favors the reverse reaction, known as the **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   **Decomposition:** Product 3 will undergo a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking back down into its constituent parts. This will liberate two molecules of o-quinodimethane and one molecule of **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one** (let's call it BDK).\n    *   **Fate of Fragments:**\n        *   The BDK molecule is known to be thermally unstable. At temperatures around 150 °C, it undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form **benzene** (C₆H₆), a very stable aromatic molecule. Benzene has only one type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry. Since '1' is not an option, we must consider the fate of the other fragment.\n        *   The o-quinodimethane molecules are extremely reactive. They cannot be isolated under these conditions and will rapidly react. The most common follow-up reaction is **dimerization**. Two molecules of o-quinodimethane react with each other. A very common and stable dimer is **5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene**, formed via a formal [4+4] cycloaddition. This dimer is a stable organic molecule and is the most logical candidate for the \"final product 4\".\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4.**\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** The dimer, 5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (C₁₆H₁₆).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. Its most stable conformation is a chair-like structure for the central eight-membered ring, which possesses C₂h symmetry.\n    *   **Counting Hydrogens:**\n        1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are two benzene rings, which are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. On each benzene ring, the four hydrogens are divided into two groups of two (an AA'BB' pattern). Thus, there are **2** distinct signals for the 8 aromatic hydrogens.\n        2.  **Aliphatic Hydrogens:** There are four methylene (-CH₂) groups in the central ring. All four are equivalent by symmetry. Within a single -CH₂ group, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (they have different chemical environments, one \"axial\" and one \"equatorial\" relative to the ring). Thus, there are **2** distinct signals for the 8 aliphatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Total:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 2 (aromatic) + 2 (aliphatic) = 4.\n\nThis number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
