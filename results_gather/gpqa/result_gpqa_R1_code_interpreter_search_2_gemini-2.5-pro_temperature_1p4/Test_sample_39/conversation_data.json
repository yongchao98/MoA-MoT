    "The user is asking to interpret a common phrase used in a synthetic organic chemistry lab.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. Key activities in such a lab include running chemical reactions and then purifying the resulting products. Purification is a critical and often challenging step.\n2.  **Analyze the phrase:** \"My compounds are on top of each other.\" This is a colloquialism. In a physical sense, it means one thing is located directly above another. In the context of chemical analysis and separation, this phrase visually represents a failure to separate two or more substances.\n3.  **Consider common separation/analysis techniques in organic chemistry:**\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer Chromatography - TLC, and Column Chromatography):** This is arguably the most common technique for monitoring reactions and purifying compounds. In TLC, a mixture is spotted on a plate coated with a stationary phase (like silica gel). A solvent (mobile phase) moves up the plate, carrying the compounds with it. Compounds separate based on their differential affinity for the stationary and mobile phases. This affinity is primarily governed by **polarity**. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate, and their spots will appear at the same height on the TLC plate, i.e., \"on top of each other.\" This is a very direct and visual representation of the problem. The same principle applies to column chromatography, where compounds with similar polarities will elute from the column at the same time, making them difficult to separate.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their **boiling points**. If compounds have similar boiling points, they will be difficult to separate by distillation. However, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is not the typical way chemists describe this problem. It's more of a visual metaphor that fits chromatography perfectly.\n    *   **Polarimetry:** This technique measures the **optical rotation** of chiral compounds. It is an analytical tool for characterization, not a separation technique. While diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, having similar optical rotations is a property you would measure *after* separation. It doesn't cause the separation problem itself.\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions:** These interactions (like van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding) are the underlying cause of physical properties like polarity and boiling point. However, the chemist's statement is describing the *observed phenomenon* during a separation attempt, not the fundamental intermolecular forces. The most direct observable property causing the issue in the most common technique (chromatography) is polarity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) Similar optical rotations: Not a separation problem.\n    *   B) Similar boiling points: A separation problem for distillation, but the phrasing doesn't fit as well as it does for chromatography.\n    *   C) Similar polarities: This directly causes poor separation in chromatography (TLC and column), the most common purification method. The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a perfect visual description of what is seen on a TLC plate when this occurs.\n    *   D) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions: This is the underlying cause of polarity, but \"similar polarities\" is the more direct and common way to describe the problem from a practical, procedural standpoint.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed separation attempt using chromatography (most likely observed on a TLC plate). The reason for this failure is that the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
