    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**1. Initial State & Dilution**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH3COOH) solution after dilution.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid, V1 = 20.00 cm3 = 20.00 mL\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid, M1 = 0.05 M\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final volume of the solution, V2 = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.0400 L\n\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 mL) / 40.00 mL = 0.025 M\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid in the 40.00 mL solution are:\nMoles_acid = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   Moles of CH3COOH reacted = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COONa (A-) formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COOH (HA) remaining = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nAt this point, the solution is a buffer containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A-). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\nKa = 1.85 x 10^-5\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since both species are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of moles:\npH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n\nFirst, we find the volume of NaOH added and the total volume of the solution:\nVolume_NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL\nTotal Volume = Volume_acid_solution + Volume_NaOH = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A-]) in the solution:\n[A-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water according to the reaction:\nCH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C):\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10\n\nNow, we can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis to find the hydroxide concentration, [OH-]:\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\nLet x = [OH-] = [CH3COOH]. The equation becomes:\n5.405 x 10^-10 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n5.405 x 10^-10 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\nx^2 = (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10^-11\nx = [OH-] = √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pOH and then the pH:\npOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculation for 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25/75 or 1/3\nratio = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Calculation for equivalence point ---\n\n# Initial moles of acid after dilution (0.025 M in 40 mL)\nmoles_acid = 0.025 * 0.040\n\n# At equivalence, all acid is converted to conjugate base. Moles of base = moles_acid.\n# Volume of NaOH (0.1 M) added to reach equivalence\nvolume_NaOH = moles_acid / 0.1\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume = 0.040 + volume_NaOH\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_base = moles_acid / total_volume\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of the base: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Base]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Base])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<\nA\n>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial volume of the acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ (V1), and its initial concentration is 0.05 M (M1). It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the final volume 40.00 cm³ (V2).\n\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 mol/L * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM2 = 0.025 M\nThe starting concentration of the acetic acid for the titration is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A-). This means 75% of the original acid remains. The solution is a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa from Ka:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3.\npH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), in water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence:**\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution at equivalence:**\n    Total Volume = Initial Volume + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n*   **Concentration of the acetate ion [A-] at equivalence:**\n    [A-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\nCH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need to find the Kb for acetate:\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we can find the [OH⁻] concentration:\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n[OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nCalculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
