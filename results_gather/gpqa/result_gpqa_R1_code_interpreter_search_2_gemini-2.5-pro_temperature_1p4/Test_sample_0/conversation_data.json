    "This problem can be solved by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nThis principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"broadened\" over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Broadening for Each State:**\nWe can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state using its lifetime (τ = Δt). For calculation purposes, we can use the form ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy broadening ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy broadening ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo perform the calculation more precisely, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\n# Value of reduced Planck constant (hbar) in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them\n# must be greater than their energy widths. A common criterion is that\n# the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths.\ntotal_width = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Sum of widths (Delta E1 + Delta E2): {total_width:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe required energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the energy widths.\")\nprint(f\"Specifically, the difference should be larger than the broader width, which is Delta E1 = {delta_E1:.4e} eV, and ideally larger than their sum.\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nEnergy width of state 1 (Delta E1): 6.5821e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (Delta E2): 6.5821e-08 eV\nSum of widths (Delta E1 + Delta E2): 7.2403e-07 eV\n\nThe required energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the energy widths.\nSpecifically, the difference should be larger than the broader width, which is Delta E1 = 6.5821e-07 eV, and ideally larger than their sum.\n</execute_result>\n\n**3. Determining the Resolvable Energy Difference:**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy broadenings (ΔE₁ and ΔE₂). A conservative condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual widths.\n\nFrom our calculation:\n*   The sum of the widths is ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   The broader of the two widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be greater than approximately 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Comparing with the Given Options:**\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than the required difference)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is 1000 times larger than the required difference)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than the required difference)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than the required difference)\n\nOnly the value in option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels are clearly distinguishable, as it is much larger than the natural linewidths of the states.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the calculation, the energy broadenings for the two states are:\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A good criterion is that the difference should be much larger than the sum of the widths.\n\nSum of widths = (6.58 x 10⁻⁷) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nWe need to find an option that is much greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nLet's examine the options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than the required difference)\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is about 1000 times larger than the sum of the widths, so it is clearly resolvable)\nC) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than the required difference)\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than the required difference)\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for a clear resolution of the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
