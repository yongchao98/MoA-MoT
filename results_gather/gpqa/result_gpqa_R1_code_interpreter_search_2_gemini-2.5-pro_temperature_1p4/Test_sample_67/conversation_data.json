    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin operator **S** = (Sx, Sy, Sz).\n    *   Its magnetic moment vector is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field **B** = B**k** (pointing in the +Z direction). This means the particle is in a spin eigenstate of the Hamiltonian `H_initial = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S_z`. To be aligned, it must be in the lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`). The corresponding energies are `-γB(ħ/2)` and `+γB(ħ/2)` (assuming `γ` and `B` are positive). The lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to **B'** = B**j** (pointing in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -**μ** · **B'** = -γ(**S** · B**j**) = -γB S_y`.\n    *   The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the particle at the moment of the change (`t=0`) is still `|+z>`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, and the solution is given by:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` and the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    *   This is the operator for a rotation around the y-axis. Let the Larmor frequency be `ω = γB`. The operator is `exp(iωtS_y/ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Moment:**\n    *   We want to find the oscillation frequency of the *average* (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`.\n    *   We need to calculate `<S_z(t)>`. We can do this by expressing the state `|ψ(t)>` in the `S_z` basis.\n    *   Using the expansion for the rotation operator `exp(iαS_y/ħ) = cos(α/2)I + iσ_y sin(α/2)` where `α=ωt`, and `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`. This is equivalent to `exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)|+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)I + iσ_y sin(ωt/2)) |+z>`\n    *   We know `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `σ_y|+z> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] [1, 0]^T = i[0, 1]^T = i|-z>`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> + i sin(ωt/2) (i|-z>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now, we calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    *   Using `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and the orthogonality of `|+z>` and `|-z>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, with `θ = ωt/2`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    *   Substituting back `ω = γB`:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function, which is `ω`.\n    *   Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector (and thus the magnetic moment vector) precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The z-component of the moment, being perpendicular to the field, oscillates as the projection of the precessing vector onto the z-axis.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
