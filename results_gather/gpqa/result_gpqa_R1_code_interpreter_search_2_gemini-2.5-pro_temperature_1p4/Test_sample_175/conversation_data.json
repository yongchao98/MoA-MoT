    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state vector and operators.**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n    The operators for the observables P and Q are given by the matrices:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n2.  **Normalize the initial state vector.**\n    A quantum state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1.\n    The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n    The normalized initial state is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n3.  **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.**\n    We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `p=0`, as specified in the question.\n    We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = p|v⟩` for `p=0`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = 0 * [[x], [y], [z]]`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    `(x+z)/√2 = 0 => x = -z`\n    `y/√2 = 0`\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. We can choose a representative vector, for example, `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n    Now, we normalize this eigenvector:\n    The squared norm is `1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2`.\n    The normalization constant is `1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue `p_i` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of its corresponding eigenvector `|p_i⟩` and the system's state `|ψ_norm⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩|^2`\n    The inner product is:\n    `⟨p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] * [(1/√6) * [[-1], [2], [1]]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * [1, 0, -1] * [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    The probability is the square of this value:\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)^2 = 1/3`\n\n5.  **Determine the state of the system after the measurement of P.**\n    When a measurement of an observable is made, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.\n    Since we measured `P=0`, the state of the system after this measurement is the eigenvector `|p=0⟩`.\n    New state `|ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n6.  **Find the eigenvector for Q=-1.**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvalue `q=-1` corresponds to the eigenvector `|q=-1⟩ = [[0], [0], [1]]`. This vector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state.**\n    Now, we measure Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of getting `Q=-1` is:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|^2`\n    The inner product is:\n    `⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [(1/√2) * [[1], [0], [-1]]]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n    `= -1/√2`\n    The probability is the square of this value:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2`\n\n8.  **Calculate the total joint probability.**\n    The probability of getting `P=0` *and then* getting `Q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n    `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n    `= (1/3) * (1/2)`\n    `= 1/6`\n\n<<<C>>>"
