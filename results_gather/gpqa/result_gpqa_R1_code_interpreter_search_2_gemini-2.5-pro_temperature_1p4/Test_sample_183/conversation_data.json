    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern and the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at C2: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at C3: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* (1,2).\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* (2,3).\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* (1,3).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is often difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict. The most challenging aspect here is the *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl group (an o,p-director) and the nitro group (a m-director). A direct electrophilic attack to create this arrangement on a ring that already contains one of these groups is unlikely. For instance, nitrating tert-butylbenzene would primarily give the para product, with the ortho product as a minor isomer (not a high-yield route). Alkylating nitrobenzene with tert-butyl chloride (Friedel-Crafts) does not work because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring.\n\nThis difficulty suggests that a more sophisticated strategy is required, likely involving a **blocking group** to control the regiochemistry. A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent choice for a blocking group because it's bulky, a meta-director, and can be easily removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Develop a Logical Synthetic Strategy (using a blocking group)**\n\nA powerful strategy to control substitution is to:\n1.  Install the alkyl group.\n2.  Use a blocking group to occupy the most reactive position (usually para).\n3.  Install the next substituent, which will now be directed to the remaining activated positions (ortho).\n\nLet's apply this:\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group to benzene.\n    Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Add the blocking group. Due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group, sulfonation will occur almost exclusively at the para position.\n    tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** Now, nitrate the ring. We have two directing groups:\n    *   -tBu at C1 is an o,p-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    *   -SO3H at C4 is a m-director (directs to C2, C6).\n    Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a highly regioselective reaction.\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\nThis initial sequence (Alkylation → Sulfonation → Nitration) is a very logical and high-yield approach to creating a specific trisubstituted benzene intermediate.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine which of the given options follows this logical start.\n*   **A)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) tBu-Cl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4... The order is incorrect. It also leads to the wrong isomer and has superfluous steps.\n*   **C)** i) HNO3/H2SO4... Starts with nitration, and the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (after reduction) is problematic. The order is incorrect.\n*   **D)** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4... This option perfectly matches the first three steps of our logical, regiocontrolled strategy.\n\n**5. Assess the Complete Sequence in Option D**\n\nWhile the first three steps of Option D are the most chemically sound approach among all choices, the entire sequence as written presents inconsistencies. The intermediate produced, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, has the t-Bu and -NO2 groups *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. The subsequent steps as listed in option D do not provide a standard mechanism to alter this relative positioning.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where options A, B, and C contain clear and fundamental errors (failed reactions, incorrect starting order for selectivity), Option D presents the most plausible *strategic thinking*, even if the problem statement (target molecule or subsequent steps) might be flawed. The use of a blocking group as shown in the initial steps of D is the key textbook method for tackling such a complex substitution pattern. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe subsequent (hypothetically correct) steps would involve manipulation of the nitro and sulfonic acid groups (e.g., reduction, diazotization, substitution, desulfonation) to arrive at the final product, but the exact order is scrambled or incorrect in the provided option. Nevertheless, the foundation of the synthesis in D is superior to all other options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
