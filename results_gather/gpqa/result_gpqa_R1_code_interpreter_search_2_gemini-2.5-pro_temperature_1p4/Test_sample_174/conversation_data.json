    "An oscillating charge distribution, especially one with a well-defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiation emitted by such a dipole has specific characteristics in the radiation zone (far from the source).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. The formula for this power distribution is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental physical constants.\n\n    The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function `f(λ, θ)`. Therefore, we can write:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The power `f(λ, θ)` is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The problem defines this maximum power as `A`. So,\n    `A = f_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`. Using the same proportionality:\n    `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\n4.  **Find the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of `f(λ, 30°)` to `f_max`.\n    Fraction = `f(λ, 30°) / f_max` = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)` = `sin²(30°) / 1` = `sin²(30°)`.\n\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    This narrows the possible answers down to options A and C.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    The total power `P` radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the expression `ω = 2πc / λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the power relation:\n    `P ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\n    The function `f(λ, θ)` represents the power per unit solid angle. The total power `P` is the integral of `f(λ, θ)` over all solid angles. Since the angular part `sin²(θ)` is independent of wavelength, the wavelength dependence of `f(λ, θ)` must be the same as that of the total power `P`.\n    Therefore, a possible form for `f` must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁴ * sin²(θ)`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is a manifestation of dipole radiation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form of the function `f` for the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we choose the option that matches both.\n\n<<<C>>>"
