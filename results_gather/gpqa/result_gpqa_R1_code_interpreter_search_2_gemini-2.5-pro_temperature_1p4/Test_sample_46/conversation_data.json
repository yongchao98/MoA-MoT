    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This pattern (a triplet) indicates that these protons are on a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This pattern (a quartet) indicates that these protons are on a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. A broad signal in this region, combined with the IR evidence, confirms the presence of the primary amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The region from 6.5 to 8.5 ppm is the aromatic region. Seeing two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, creating two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ethyl part is confirmed by the triplet and quartet. The ester is confirmed by the C=O stretch in the IR and the chemical shift of the -O-CH2- protons.\n    3.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    4.  Assembling these pieces: We attach the -NH2 group and the -COOCH2CH3 group to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR chemical shifts. The -NH2 group is electron-donating, and the -COOCH2CH3 group is electron-withdrawing.\n        *   Protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group will be shielded (shifted upfield). These correspond to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n        *   Protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group will be deshielded (shifted downfield). These correspond to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n    6.  The molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Contains a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. Incorrect.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). In this case, the NMR quartet for the -CH2- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
