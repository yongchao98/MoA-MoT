    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship: the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars varies with distance (`r`), specifically the number of stars per unit range of distance.\n    *   We need the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax: `r = 1/plx` or `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" needs to be translated into a mathematical form. In physics and astronomy, when we talk about how a population is distributed with respect to a variable, we often refer to the number density or the differential count. Let's denote the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` as `dN`. The statement implies that the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   So, we can write this relationship as: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`. Let's use `k` as the proportionality constant: `dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target Quantity:**\n    *   The question asks \"How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\".\n    *   This is asking for the number of stars per unit distance, which is the differential quantity `dN/dr`. Our goal is to find what `dN/dr` is proportional to.\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    *   We need to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transformation Factor (`d(plx)/dr`):**\n    *   We know the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n    *   We differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` back into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/dr = (k * plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   The equation is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need to express it solely in terms of `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n        `dN/dr = (k * (1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr = (k * r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr = -k * r⁵/r²`\n        `dN/dr = -k * r³`\n\n7.  **Determine the Proportionality:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr = -k * r³` shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign indicates the direction of change (as distance `r` increases, the parallax `plx` decreases, and we are moving across the distribution), but for proportionality, we are interested in the power of `r`.\n    *   Therefore, `dN/dr ∝ r³`.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated proportionality `~ r³` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
