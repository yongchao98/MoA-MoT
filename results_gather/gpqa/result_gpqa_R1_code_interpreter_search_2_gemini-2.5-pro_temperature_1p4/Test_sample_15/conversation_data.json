    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule contains a C=C double bond, leading to geometric isomerism (Z/E), but it does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but we are given its absolute stereochemistry via the descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that the molecule has chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a). The 'E' descriptor specifies the geometry of a double bond.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, might be a meso compound (like the endo-Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride). However, the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (`=CH-Cl`), presumably on the methano bridge (C7 in norbornane numbering), breaks the potential plane of symmetry of the core structure.\n    *   Because the substituent destroys the internal symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral. The name specifies a single, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R, 3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable (an enantiomeric pair).\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (one path around the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other path).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This molecule has three OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The designation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three groups have the same relative stereochemistry (all cis or all trans).\n    *   In the all-cis configuration (all OH groups pointing to the same side of the ring, e.g., all axial or all equatorial), the molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. It's worth noting that the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers in this symmetric molecule (they are prochiral).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Following IUPAC nomenclature, the parent chain is butan-1-one, with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`. This can also be seen as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups, and the rest of the chain. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
