    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH will depend on what species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each component:**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen Ions (H+) from HCl:**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles H⁺ = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Hydroxide Ions (OH⁻) from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely, producing two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles Ba(OH)₂ = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles OH⁻ = 2 × Moles Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺) until one is completely consumed.\n\n*   **Strong Acid - Strong Base Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Initial moles OH⁻ - Moles of H⁺ reacted = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH⁻**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Weak Acid - Strong Base Reaction:** CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH available = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Moles OH⁻ available - Moles CH₃COOH reacted = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate pH:**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible compared to the strong base. Therefore, the pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 8.92\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.68\n\nThe calculated pH of 12.62 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
