    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the baseline (Option a):**\n    *   This option describes a planet identical to Earth in both mass and radius.\n    *   Earth's average density is a standard reference point, approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³).\n    *   Density of planet (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option b:**\n    *   This option describes a planet with 2 Earth masses and explicitly states its density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This density is nearly identical to Earth's.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option c:**\n    *   This option describes a \"Super-Earth\" with the same composition as our planet but 5 times the mass.\n    *   A fundamental principle in planetary science is **gravitational compression**. When you add more mass to a rocky planet (while keeping the composition the same), its own gravity becomes stronger.\n    *   This stronger gravity compresses the material (rock and iron) more tightly, squeezing the atoms closer together.\n    *   Increased compression leads to a higher overall density.\n    *   Therefore, a planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition will be significantly denser than Earth. Its density will be greater than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option d:**\n    *   This option describes a \"sub-Earth\" with the same composition as our planet but only half the mass.\n    *   Following the same logic as in step 3, less mass means weaker self-gravity.\n    *   With less gravitational compression, the material will be less compact than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, this planet will be less dense than Earth. Its density will be less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n5.  **Compare the options:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high gravitational compression)\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low gravitational compression)\n\nBy comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one guaranteed to have a density greater than Earth's. It will, therefore, have the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
