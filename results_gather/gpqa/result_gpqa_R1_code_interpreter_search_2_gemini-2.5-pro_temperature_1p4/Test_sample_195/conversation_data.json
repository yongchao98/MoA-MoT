    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the isolated relativistic harmonic oscillator system is conserved. The total energy is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring.\n    *   The total energy $E_{total}$ is given by:\n        $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x)$\n    *   The relativistic energy of the particle is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude:**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the displacement is $x=A$.\n    *   At this point, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor at this point is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position:**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the displacement is $x=0$.\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U=0$), and the kinetic energy (and thus the speed) is at its maximum. Let's call the maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor corresponding to the maximum speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the energy at the equilibrium position.\n        $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n    *   We want to find $v_{max}$, so we first solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
