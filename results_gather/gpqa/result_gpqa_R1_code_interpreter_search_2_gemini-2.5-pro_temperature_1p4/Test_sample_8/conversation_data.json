    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n2.  A **σh (horizontal mirror plane)**: A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. Crucially, a molecule in the C3h point group must *not* have additional symmetry elements like C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, or vertical mirror planes (σv), as those would place it in a higher symmetry point group (like D3h or D3d).\n\n**Analyzing the Molecules**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   **Structure**: It has a bicyclic cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. Rotating the molecule 120 degrees around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. A plane halfway along the N-C axis would reflect the -CH2-CH2- bridges into empty space.\n    *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three maleic anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Additionally, it has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule and three vertical mirror planes (σv) containing the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of the C3 axis, σh plane, C2 axes, and σv planes, mellitic trianhydride belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it has the elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger planar molecule based on a triphenylene core, which is itself highly symmetric. The symmetrical fusion of three anhydride-like groups maintains this high symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It also possesses additional C2 and σv elements.\n*   **Conclusion**: This molecule also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds. The most stable, lowest-energy conformation is a propeller-like shape with C3 symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis for C3h**: We need to determine if a conformation exists that has *exactly* C3h symmetry.\n    *   Let's construct such a conformation:\n        1.  Place the central Boron (B) atom at the origin. Let the C3 axis be the z-axis. Let the σh plane be the xy-plane.\n        2.  For the σh plane to be a symmetry element, the three Oxygen (O) atoms, the three alpha-Carbon atoms (the C from CH), and the three alpha-Hydrogen atoms (the H from CH) must all lie in this xy-plane.\n        3.  For each isopropyl group, `-CH(CH3)2`, the C and H lie in the plane. The two methyl groups (`-CH3`) must be arranged symmetrically with respect to the plane. This is achieved by placing one methyl group above the plane and the other an equal distance below the plane, so they are reflections of each other.\n    *   Let's check the symmetry of this conformation:\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n        *   It has a σh plane (the plane containing the B-O-C-H skeleton).\n        *   It does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to C3, nor any σv planes. A vertical plane would reflect a top methyl group into empty space, not another methyl group.\n*   **Conclusion**: While not its lowest-energy state, triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. In the context of this question, where the other options belong to different point groups (C3v and D3h), this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Decision**\n*   A) quinuclidine: C3v\n*   B) triisopropyl borate: Can adopt a C3h conformation.\n*   C) ...trifuran...hexaone (mellitic trianhydride): D3h\n*   D) ...trifuran...hexaone (triphenylene derivative): D3h\n\nThe only molecule that fits the C3h point group is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
