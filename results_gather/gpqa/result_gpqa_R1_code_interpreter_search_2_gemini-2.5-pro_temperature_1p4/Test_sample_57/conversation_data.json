    "This question requires understanding a concept in theoretical physics called \"regularization\" and knowing which theories require it.\n\n1.  **Understanding Regularization:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate physical quantities (like the probability of a particle interaction), our calculations often involve integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles involved in the interaction. Many of these integrals turn out to be infinite, or \"divergent,\" specifically when considering very high energies (also known as the \"ultraviolet\" or UV regime). Regularization is a mathematical trick to make these integrals finite. It involves temporarily modifying the theory, for instance, by imposing a \"cutoff\" on the maximum energy considered. After regularization, a related process called \"renormalization\" is used to absorb the infinities into a redefinition of the fundamental constants of the theory (like the mass and charge of a particle), resulting in finite and physically meaningful predictions.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the QFT of the strong nuclear force. Like other QFTs, its calculations involve loop diagrams that lead to UV divergences. Therefore, QCD critically depends on regularization and renormalization to make predictions.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it suffers from its own type of high-energy/short-distance problem. For example, the self-energy of an idealized point charge is infinite. This indicates that the classical theory is incomplete at very small scales. While one could \"regularize\" this by assuming the charge is not a point but a small sphere, the standard machinery of regularization is primarily a tool for the loop divergences found in quantum theories. The problem in classical electrodynamics is a symptom that the theory needs to be replaced by a quantum theory (QED) at high energies.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT of the electromagnetic force. It was the first theory where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully developed and applied. Calculations in QED are plagued by UV divergences from loop diagrams, and the theory would be useless without regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all forces of nature, including gravity. A key feature and motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite.\" Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. Interactions in string theory are \"smeared out\" in spacetime, which elegantly smooths out the short-distance behavior that causes divergences in QFTs. As a result, calculations of interaction amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to be finite without the need for regularization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) are both quantum field theories that require regularization to handle high-energy divergences. Classical Electrodynamics has a high-energy problem but is a classical theory, and the issue is resolved in its quantum successor, QED. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a theory that is finite at high energies and therefore does not need regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
