Understand the Decay Process**\nThe decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$) is given by:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n**2. Given Information**\n*   The initial pion is stationary.\n*   Rest energy of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4.

Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  Expand the left side: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out. Solve for `pc`:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, π⁺) into two other particles (muon, μ⁺, and a neutrino, ν). This process is governed by two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\nSince the particles involved can travel at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use the equations from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Initial particle: Positive pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy (m_νc²) is 0 MeV.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary.\n*   Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n*   This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν): E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = √((pc)² + 0) = pc\n*   Setting initial energy equal to final energy:\n    *   m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n**5.

Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root:\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n2.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  Expand the left side:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  The (pc)² term cancels out on both sides. Now, solve for pc:\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\n1.

The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest energies:\n    KE_total = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n    This energy is shared between the two products:\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\n**7.

Understand the Decay Process**\n\nThe decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) is given by:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**2. State the Given Information**\n\n*   The initial particle, the pion (π⁺), is stationary.\n*   Rest energy of π⁺ (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of μ⁺ (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless (m_νc² = 0).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final Momentum:** To conserve momentum, the two product particles (muon and neutrino) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The total energy of the stationary pion is its rest energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν). We must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = √((pc)² + 0) = pc\n*   **Energy Conservation Equation:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\n**5. Solve for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can solve the energy conservation equation for the momentum term `pc`.\n\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n2.  Square both sides:\n    (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n3.  The (pc)² term cancels out. Solve for `pc`:\n    2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\n    pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n4.  Substitute the given values:\n    pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n    pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energies (KE).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is purely kinetic.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest energies (the Q-value).\n    KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n    KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    Now, we can find the muon's kinetic energy:\n    KE_μ = KE_total - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (pion, π⁺) into two other particles (muon, μ⁺, and a neutrino, ν). This process is governed by two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the equations from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   To conserve momentum, the two product particles (μ⁺ and ν) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n    *   $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$): $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n*   Therefore: $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): $E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   For the neutrino (ν): We assume it is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its total energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since it's massless, its total energy is also its kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$).\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe can now combine these equations to solve for the unknown energies.\n\n1.  Substitute $E_{\\nu} = pc$ into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + pc$\n2.  Rearrange this to express the muon's total energy:\n    $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$\n3.  Substitute this expression for $E_{\\mu}$ into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Expand the left side of the equation:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n5.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides. We can now rearrange to solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**7. Determine the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest energies:\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    $KE_{\\mu} + 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} + 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 4.1 \\text{ MeV}$\n    A more precise calculation gives $4.12$ MeV.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (μ⁺) and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino (ν).
