  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAstronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Principles\nThe goal is to find the luminosity ratio, L₁/L₂, for two stars. The solution requires combining three core principles of physics:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on radius R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) ² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). This means:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving. The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂). The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Information\n*   **Radius Ratio:** R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Velocity Data:** v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. This information is crucial and must be used.\n*   **Wavelength Data:** λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation principles and serves as a distractor.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Principles to Find the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n1.  Use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n2.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n3.  Now, use this relationship to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for Wien's Law:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n4.  Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n*   v_r,₂ / c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe value 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The majority of the provided answers that correctly applied all the physical principles arrived at this same result. The answer of 2.25 (Option C) arises from incorrectly ignoring the Doppler effect caused by the radial velocity of Star 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Foundational Physical Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem rests on three key principles of physics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_emitted). Specifically, the temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. For a source moving away with a radial velocity (v_r), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted). The non-relativistic formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n**2. Deriving the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio L₁ / L₂. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**3. Analyzing the Given Information and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first term is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the mass (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for this calculation, which is based on black body radiation principles. It is included to distract from the correct method.\n*   **Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step):**\n    *   The temperature ratio depends on the ratio of the *emitted* peak wavelengths (T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁).\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* (\"appeared brightest\") peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star 1, with v_r,₁ = 0, there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, with v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, the light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.25\n*   C) ~2.32\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23. The common mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect, which would incorrectly lead to an answer of 2.25. The inclusion of the radial velocity data is essential for the correct solution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of our equation is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part and requires combining two physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* (λ_emitted). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are equal. The observed wavelength is shifted from the emitted wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n    *   **Connecting the laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since we are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can say: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, I will substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the precise numerical result.

So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emitted}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) due to the source's radial velocity ($v_r$). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\nThe constants cancel, leaving:\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n**4.

The ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law and Doppler Effect:**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   Wien's displacement law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted), so T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. So, λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the Doppler effect formula: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.\n    *   For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link between them.\n*   **Ignoring Doppler Shift:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option C), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponent:** The temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power in the final luminosity calculation, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe primary goal is to find the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂. The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies, which brings three key physical laws into play:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law provides the formula for a star's total radiated power (luminosity, L) based on its size and temperature: L = 4πR²σT⁴. For our ratio, this simplifies to:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength of its emitted light (λ_rest): T ∝ 1/λ_rest. This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-wavelength ratio:\n    **T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁**\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This principle explains how the motion of a star affects the wavelength of light we observe. It connects the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the intrinsic, rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest).\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Information and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.

Thus, λ_observed,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, v_r,₂ = 700 km/s.

The key principles are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's total radiated power, or luminosity (L), is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). For a spherical star with radius R, the area is A = 4πR², so the law is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted).\n    T ∝ 1/λ_emitted\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving with radial velocity v_r (where positive means moving away), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n    where c is the speed of light. This non-relativistic formula is accurate here since 700 km/s is much less than c.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can create a ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L₁) and Star 2 (L₂):\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore:\n**(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)\nThis step requires careful application of Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   We must relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star 1: v_r,₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n*   Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nSubstitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n*   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n**L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   The calculated value is approximately 2.229.\n*   Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~2.25\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.32\n*   The value 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n*   **Crucial Point:** The distinction between *observed* and *emitted* wavelength is the key to the problem.

The total luminosity (L) also depends on the star's surface area (which is a function of its radius, R). The formula is:\n    `L = 4πR²σT⁴`\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). Specifically, the temperature is inversely proportional to this peak wavelength:\n    `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes the change in observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. For a source moving away with radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) is longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`). The non-relativistic formula, which is appropriate here, is:\n    `λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)`\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n`(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n*   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (`λ_obs`). So, `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`.\n*   We must relate this observation to the stars' temperatures using Wien's Law, which depends on the **emitted** wavelength (`λ_emitted`).\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n*   From Wien's Law, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n*   Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect, we get: `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nNow, substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   `v₂ = 700 km/s`\n*   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s` (speed of light)\n\n`v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333`\n\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.25\n*   B) ~2.32\n*   C) ~2.35\n*   D) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 2.23.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength and the *emitted* peak wavelength. The problem's wording \"appeared brightest\" refers to the observed value.\n*   The radial velocity information is essential for correcting the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength via the Doppler effect, which is then used to find the true temperature ratio.\n*   The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and intended as a distractor.\n*   Ignoring the Doppler effect would lead to the incorrect conclusion that T₁ = T₂, resulting in an answer of 2.25.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a perfect black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* or *emitted* peak wavelength of its radiation (λ_emitted). So, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away with radial velocity (v_r), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) according to the formula λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n**3.

Its light is redshifted: λ_observed,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n**5. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial point is distinguishing between the \"observed\" peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the \"emitted\" peak wavelength (which is used in Wien's Law to determine temperature). The radial velocity data is essential to connect the two.\n*   **Ignoring Doppler Effect:** An incorrect approach is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an answer of 2.25, which ignores the explicit data about the stars' velocities.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles (luminosity, radius, temperature) and should be ignored.\n\n**6.

The solution requires combining three core principles of physics:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on radius R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂) ² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). This means:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving. The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂). The Doppler formula connects the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Information\n*   **Radius Ratio:** R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Velocity Data:** v_r,₁ = 0 km/s and v_r,₂ = 700 km/s. This information is crucial and must be used.\n*   **Wavelength Data:** λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation principles and serves as a distractor.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Principles to Find the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n1.  Use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star 1 (v_r,₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁\n    *   For Star 2 (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s): λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n2.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n3.  Now, use this relationship to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for Wien's Law:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n4.

Foundational Physical Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem rests on three key principles of physics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_emitted). Specifically, the temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes the change in the observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. For a source moving away with a radial velocity (v_r), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted).

The formula for the ratio is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Determine the Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of our equation is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part and requires combining two physical laws.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* (λ_emitted). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the stars *appeared* brightest at the same wavelength, meaning their *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are equal. The observed wavelength is shifted from the emitted wavelength due to the star's radial velocity (v). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n    *   **Connecting the laws:**\n        *   For Star_1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since we are given λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can say: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, I will substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula and use Python to calculate the precise numerical result.

The ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law and Doppler Effect:**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   Wien's displacement law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted), so T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. So, λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength using the Doppler effect formula: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.\n    *   For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The crucial distinction is that the problem gives information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature relates to the *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the necessary link between them.\n*   **Ignoring Doppler Shift:** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option C), ignoring the provided velocity data.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses is not needed for a calculation based on black body radiation and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponent:** The temperature ratio must be raised to the fourth power in the final luminosity calculation, as dictated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe primary goal is to find the luminosity ratio, L₁ / L₂. The problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies, which brings three key physical laws into play:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law provides the formula for a star's total radiated power (luminosity, L) based on its size and temperature: L = 4πR²σT⁴. For our ratio, this simplifies to:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength of its emitted light (λ_rest): T ∝ 1/λ_rest. This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-wavelength ratio:\n    **T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁**\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This principle explains how the motion of a star affects the wavelength of light we observe. It connects the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the intrinsic, rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest).\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Information and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**. This part is straightforward.\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not used in the laws of black body radiation. It is extra information intended to be a potential distractor.\n\n*   **Wavelength Information (The Crucial Point):** The problem states \"the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest... are the same.\" The word \"appeared\" is critical. It refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), not the intrinsic wavelength emitted by the star. Therefore, **λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂**.\n\n*   **Velocity Information:** The radial velocities (v₁ = 0 km/s and v₂ = 700 km/s) are provided specifically to allow us to correct the observed wavelengths to their intrinsic rest-frame wavelengths using the Doppler effect. Ignoring this information leads to an incorrect answer.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Find the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\n    *   We need the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths (λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁).\n    *   Let's relate the observed wavelengths to the rest wavelengths using the Doppler formula: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0): λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁ * (1 + 0/c)  =>  **λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁**\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): **λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)**\n    *   Since we know λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can set the two expressions equal:\n        λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   Now, we rearrange this to get the ratio needed for Wien's Law:\n        **λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        **T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n\n2.  **Assemble the Final Luminosity Ratio Formula:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the main Stefan-Boltzmann ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n3.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n**4.

The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes the change in the *observed* wavelength of light (λ_observed) due to the source's motion relative to the observer. For a source moving away with radial velocity (v_r), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n**3.

The key principles are:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's total radiated power, or luminosity (L), is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). For a spherical star with radius R, the area is A = 4πR², so the law is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted).\n    T ∝ 1/λ_emitted\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving with radial velocity v_r (where positive means moving away), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n    where c is the speed of light. This non-relativistic formula is accurate here since 700 km/s is much less than c.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can create a ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 (L₁) and Star 2 (L₂):\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore:\n**(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)\nThis step requires careful application of Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n*   We must relate these observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star 1: v_r,₁ = 0, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2: v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n*   Now, we rearrange this to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nSubstitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r,₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (speed of light)\n*   v_r,₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n**L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   The calculated value is approximately 2.229.\n*   Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~2.25\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.32\n*   The value 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n*   **Crucial Point:** The distinction between *observed* and *emitted* wavelength is the key to the problem. Ignoring the Doppler effect (i.e., assuming T₁=T₂) leads to the incorrect answer of 2.25.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the masses of the stars (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not needed for this black body radiation problem and is included as a distractor.\n\nThe final answer is the one that correctly incorporates the Doppler shift to find the true temperature ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Physical Laws\nThe problem requires understanding three key principles of physics:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) also depends on the star's surface area (which is a function of its radius, R). The formula is:\n    `L = 4πR²σT⁴`\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted`). Specifically, the temperature is inversely proportional to this peak wavelength:\n    `T ∝ 1 / λ_emitted`\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** This effect describes the change in observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. For a source moving away with radial velocity `v`, the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) is longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`). The non-relativistic formula, which is appropriate here, is:\n    `λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)`\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is:\n`(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n*   The problem states that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (`λ_obs`). So, `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`.\n*   We must relate this observation to the stars' temperatures using Wien's Law, which depends on the **emitted** wavelength (`λ_emitted`).\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. `λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁`.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. `λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: `λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n*   From Wien's Law, `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁`.\n*   Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect, we get: `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nNow, substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   `v₂ = 700 km/s`\n*   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s` (speed of light)\n\n`v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333`\n\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

This means their *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: λ_observed,₁ = λ_observed,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: λ_observed,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted: λ_observed,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁. Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n**5. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial point is distinguishing between the \"observed\" peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the \"emitted\" peak wavelength (which is used in Wien's Law to determine temperature). The radial velocity data is essential to connect the two.\n*   **Ignoring Doppler Effect:** An incorrect approach is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This would lead to an answer of 2.25, which ignores the explicit data about the stars' velocities.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is not relevant to a calculation based on black-body radiation principles (luminosity, radius, temperature) and should be ignored.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s (the speed of light)\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**7.

Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**2. Recall the Governing Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a perfect black body is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light (λ_obs) from a moving source is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength (λ_emitted). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the source is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**4.
