Identify the Problem and Given Information\nThe goal is to find the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameter `a`:** 10 Angstrom (interpreted from \"interatomic distance\")\n*   **Interaxial Angle `α`:** 30° (for a rhombohedral system, α = β = γ)\n*   **Miller Indices `(hkl)`:** (111)\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Formula\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\nThere are two main approaches demonstrated by the agents: direct substitution with decimal approximations, and algebraic simplification before substitution. The simplification method is less prone to rounding errors.\n\n**Method 1: Algebraic Simplification (as seen in Answer 1 and Answer 11)**\n\nFor the (111) plane, `h=1`, `k=1`, `l=1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 3`\n\nSubstitute these into the formula's numerator:\n*   Numerator = `3sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα) = 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\n*   Using the identity `sin²α = 1 - cos²α`, the numerator becomes `3(1 - cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3 + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - cosα)²`.\n\nThe denominator's volumetric term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored to `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nThe entire formula for the (111) plane simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given values `a = 10` and `α = 30°` (so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`):\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nSolving for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nUsing `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543 $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation (as seen in most other answers)**\nThis method involves substituting decimal values for trigonometric functions directly into the full formula. While valid, it is susceptible to rounding errors if not enough precision is maintained. Most agents who used this method and maintained sufficient precision also arrived at a value of approximately 9.54 Å.\n\n### 4. Compare with Options and Final Decision\nThe calculated value is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Formula Choice:** It is critical to use the correct formula for the rhombohedral crystal system.\n*   **Calculation Precision:** Using decimal approximations for trigonometric values can introduce rounding errors. The algebraic simplification is a more robust method for this specific problem.\n*   **Final Selection:** Several candidate answers calculated the correct numerical value but then selected the incorrect letter option. It is crucial to carefully match the final calculated value to the provided options.\n\nBased on the consistent and accurate calculations, the interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Given Information**\nThe objective is to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice Parameter (interatomic distance), `a`: 10 Angstrom\n*   Interaxial Angle, `α`: 30° (for a rhombohedral system, α = β = γ)\n*   Miller Indices, `(hkl)`: (111)\n\n**2. Select the Correct Formula**\nThe interplanar distance `d_hkl` for a rhombohedral crystal is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n**3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**\nA crucial step to reduce calculation errors is to simplify the formula for the specific case of the (111) plane where `h=k=l=1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula and simplifying the numerator and denominator (as shown in detail by Answer 1 and Answer 11) leads to a much more manageable expression:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\nNow, we solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nUsing the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} $$\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Decision**\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. We must compare this result to the original list of options provided in the question:\n*   A) 9.54 Angstrom\n*   B) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   C) 8.95 Angstrom\n*   D) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom directly matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors:**\n*   **Calculation:** Most candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical value to be ~9.54. Some introduce minor errors by rounding intermediate steps, but the result is still closest to 9.54.\n*   **Formula:** All candidates used the correct formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Simplification:** The most robust solutions (like Answer 1 and 11) used a simplified version of the formula for the (111) plane, which is less prone to error.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The most common error among the candidate answers was incorrectly matching the calculated value to the option letter. Many answers calculated 9.54 but chose B, C, or D, indicating a likely mix-up of the option list. The final decision must be based on the original options provided.\n\nBased on a correct and precise calculation, the interplanar distance is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to act as an AI assistant, analyze 15 different answers to a crystallography problem, and determine the correct solution. I need to explain my reasoning, provide a single Python code block to verify the calculation, and then state the final answer in the specified format.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Core Problem:**\n    *   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral. This is the key piece of information that dictates the formula to be used.\n    *   **Lattice Parameters:** `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom. The problem states \"interatomic distance,\" which in this context is the length of the primitive lattice vectors, `a`.\n    *   **Interaxial Angles:** `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   **Plane of Interest:** Miller indices `(hkl) = (111)`.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the interplanar distance, `d_hkl`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Answers:**\n    *   **Formula:** I scanned the answers to see if they used the correct formula. Most agents correctly identified the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system:\n        `1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n    *   **Calculation Errors:** I noticed that agents using this full formula with manually entered, rounded-off trigonometric values (e.g., `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`) sometimes got slightly different results (e.g., 9.526 Å vs. 9.543 Å). This highlights the importance of precision.\n    *   **Simplification:** A few agents (notably Answer 1, 11, and 12) used a simplified version of the formula specifically for the (111) plane. This is a superior method as it reduces the number of terms and the potential for calculation errors. I verified this simplification:\n        *   For (111), `h²+k²+l² = 3` and `hk+kl+lh = 3`.\n        *   The formula becomes `1/d₁₁₁² = [ 3sin²α + 6(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`.\n        *   Through algebraic and trigonometric identities, this simplifies to `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`.\n        This simplified formula is much more robust.\n    *   **Conclusion Errors:** I observed that many agents, even after performing the calculation correctly, selected the wrong multiple-choice letter. For example, Answer 4 calculates ~9.54 Å but chooses option B (9.08 Å). This is a common human-like error to be wary of.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan for the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Step 1: State the Goal.** Clearly define the objective: calculate `d_111` for the given rhombohedral crystal.\n    *   **Step 2: Present the Best Method.** I will use the simplified formula for the (111) plane because it is more accurate and elegant than the full, general formula. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem.\n    *   **Step 3: Write the Code.** I will write a Python script to implement the calculation using the simplified formula. This ensures maximum precision by using the `math` library's functions.\n    *   **Step 4: Execute and Interpret.** The code will calculate the value. I will then compare this precise value to the given options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   **Step 5: Conclude.** Based on the comparison, I will state the correct option and provide the final answer in the `<<<C>>>` format.\n\n5.  **Final Check:** The calculation using the simplified formula `d₁₁₁ = sqrt([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)` yields approximately 9.543 Å. This value is extremely close to option C, 9.54 Angstrom. The majority of the agents who performed the calculation correctly arrived at this value, even if they subsequently chose the wrong letter. Therefore, I am confident that 9.54 Angstrom is the correct answer.\n\nThis structured approach ensures all aspects of the user's request are met, the reasoning is sound and easy to follow, and the final answer is derived from a reliable and precise method.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

Substitute the Given Values into the Simplified Formula**\nNow, we plug in the values for `a` and `α`:\n*   `a = 10` Å\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{(10)^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n\n**5.

Simplification for the (111) Plane\nA crucial step for ensuring accuracy and simplifying the calculation is to substitute the Miller indices (1,1,1) into the formula before plugging in the numerical values for the angle.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 6(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nAs demonstrated by several of the more accurate candidate answers (e.g., Answer 1 and 11), the numerator and the volumetric term in the denominator can be factored:\n*   **Numerator:** `3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1-cos²α) + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α) = 3(1 - cosα)²`\n*   **Denominator term:** `1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = (1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`\n\nThis leads to a significant simplification of the formula for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\nUsing this simplified formula is the most reliable way to avoid rounding errors.\n*   `a = 10` Å\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nSubstitute these values:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{3}{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\nNow, solve for `d₁₁₁`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nUsing the value `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### 5.

The correct formula, used by nearly all agents, is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n2.  **Substitute Given Parameters**:\n    *   Lattice parameter, `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial angle, `α = 30°`\n    *   Miller indices, `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**: As demonstrated in several of the more robust answers (e.g., Answer 1 and Answer 11), for the specific case of the (111) plane, the formula simplifies significantly. This is because the numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the volumetric term in the denominator, `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`, can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`. This leads to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1-\\cos\\alpha)^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    This simplified formula is less prone to calculation errors.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: Using the simplified formula provides the most reliable result.\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n    *   Solve for `d_111`:\n        $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   Numerically, this is:\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value of approximately **9.54 Angstrom** matches one of the given choices.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy**: It is crucial to use the correct, complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision**: The most common source of minor errors among the agents was premature rounding of trigonometric values. Using exact fractional values (`√3/2`) or the simplified formula is the best practice to maintain precision. The Python script (Answer 3) also provides a high-precision result, confirming the manual calculation.\n*   **Option Matching**: A significant number of agents calculated the correct numerical value (~9.54) but selected an incorrect final letter (e.g., B, D). This highlights the importance of matching the calculated *value* to the options provided in the original question, rather than relying on potentially shuffled option lists from different sources.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly calculated the interplanar distance to be approximately 9.54 Angstrom. The most accurate and reliable solutions used either a high-precision script or an algebraic simplification of the formula before substituting numerical values. Based on the consistent numerical result, the correct answer is 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### 1.

For example, Agent 3's Python code gives `9.54` Angstrom, and Agent 4's exact fraction calculation confirms the result.\n*   **Agents using early rounding:** Agents 2, 7, and 9 used decimal approximations for trigonometric functions from the start. This led to slightly less accurate results like `9.526` Angstrom. While close, this demonstrates the risk of early rounding.\n\n### 4. Consensus and Conclusion\n*   There is a strong consensus among the agents who used precise calculation methods (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) that the numerical answer is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.\n*   The minor deviations in some answers are attributable to rounding errors.\n*   The simplification used by Agent 1 provides the most confident and straightforward path to the correct answer.\n\n### 5.

Some introduce minor errors by rounding intermediate steps, but the result is still closest to 9.54.\n*   **Formula:** All candidates used the correct formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Simplification:** The most robust solutions (like Answer 1 and 11) used a simplified version of the formula for the (111) plane, which is less prone to error.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The most common error among the candidate answers was incorrectly matching the calculated value to the option letter.

I need to explain my reasoning, provide a single Python code block to verify the calculation, and then state the final answer in the specified format.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Core Problem:**\n    *   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral. This is the key piece of information that dictates the formula to be used.\n    *   **Lattice Parameters:** `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom. The problem states \"interatomic distance,\" which in this context is the length of the primitive lattice vectors, `a`.\n    *   **Interaxial Angles:** `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   **Plane of Interest:** Miller indices `(hkl) = (111)`.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the interplanar distance, `d_hkl`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Answers:**\n    *   **Formula:** I scanned the answers to see if they used the correct formula. Most agents correctly identified the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system:\n        `1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n    *   **Calculation Errors:** I noticed that agents using this full formula with manually entered, rounded-off trigonometric values (e.g., `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`) sometimes got slightly different results (e.g., 9.526 Å vs. 9.543 Å). This highlights the importance of precision.\n    *   **Simplification:** A few agents (notably Answer 1, 11, and 12) used a simplified version of the formula specifically for the (111) plane. This is a superior method as it reduces the number of terms and the potential for calculation errors. I verified this simplification:\n        *   For (111), `h²+k²+l² = 3` and `hk+kl+lh = 3`.\n        *   The formula becomes `1/d₁₁₁² = [ 3sin²α + 6(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`.\n        *   Through algebraic and trigonometric identities, this simplifies to `1/d₁₁₁² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`.\n        This simplified formula is much more robust.\n    *   **Conclusion Errors:** I observed that many agents, even after performing the calculation correctly, selected the wrong multiple-choice letter. For example, Answer 4 calculates ~9.54 Å but chooses option B (9.08 Å). This is a common human-like error to be wary of.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan for the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Step 1: State the Goal.** Clearly define the objective: calculate `d_111` for the given rhombohedral crystal.\n    *   **Step 2: Present the Best Method.** I will use the simplified formula for the (111) plane because it is more accurate and elegant than the full, general formula. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem.\n    *   **Step 3: Write the Code.** I will write a Python script to implement the calculation using the simplified formula. This ensures maximum precision by using the `math` library's functions.\n    *   **Step 4: Execute and Interpret.** The code will calculate the value. I will then compare this precise value to the given options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   **Step 5: Conclude.** Based on the comparison, I will state the correct option and provide the final answer in the `<<<C>>>` format.\n\n5.  **Final Check:** The calculation using the simplified formula `d₁₁₁ = sqrt([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)` yields approximately 9.543 Å. This value is extremely close to option C, 9.54 Angstrom. The majority of the agents who performed the calculation correctly arrived at this value, even if they subsequently chose the wrong letter. Therefore, I am confident that 9.54 Angstrom is the correct answer.\n\nThis structured approach ensures all aspects of the user's request are met, the reasoning is sound and easy to follow, and the final answer is derived from a reliable and precise method.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The correct formula, used by nearly all agents, is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n2.  **Substitute Given Parameters**:\n    *   Lattice parameter, `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial angle, `α = 30°`\n    *   Miller indices, `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane**: As demonstrated in several of the more robust answers (e.g., Answer 1 and Answer 11), for the specific case of the (111) plane, the formula simplifies significantly. This is because the numerator becomes `3(1 - cosα)²` and the volumetric term in the denominator, `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`, can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`. This leads to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1-\\cos\\alpha)^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n    This simplified formula is less prone to calculation errors.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: Using the simplified formula provides the most reliable result.\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2(1+2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))} = \\frac{3}{100(1+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n    *   Solve for `d_111`:\n        $$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n        $$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1+\\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n    *   Numerically, this is:\n        $$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value of approximately **9.54 Angstrom** matches one of the given choices.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Formula Accuracy**: It is crucial to use the correct, complete formula for the rhombohedral system.\n*   **Calculation Precision**: The most common source of minor errors among the agents was premature rounding of trigonometric values. Using exact fractional values (`√3/2`) or the simplified formula is the best practice to maintain precision. The Python script (Answer 3) also provides a high-precision result, confirming the manual calculation.\n*   **Option Matching**: A significant number of agents calculated the correct numerical value (~9.54) but selected an incorrect final letter (e.g., B, D). This highlights the importance of matching the calculated *value* to the options provided in the original question, rather than relying on potentially shuffled option lists from different sources.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the agents correctly calculated the interplanar distance to be approximately 9.54 Angstrom.

For the (111) plane, `h=k=l=1`.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = 3`\n\nAs shown by Agent 1, the formula simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1 + 2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(α) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\n\nNumerically calculating this:\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} \\approx 10 \\times 0.9543 = 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nThis calculation is robust and the result is unambiguous.\n\n**Method B: Full Formula Calculation (Used by most other agents)**\nThis method is also correct but is more susceptible to rounding errors if not handled carefully.\n*   **Agents using high precision (Python code, exact fractions):** Agents 3, 4, and others who performed the calculation carefully also arrived at the same result, `d ≈ 9.54` Angstrom. For example, Agent 3's Python code gives `9.54` Angstrom, and Agent 4's exact fraction calculation confirms the result.\n*   **Agents using early rounding:** Agents 2, 7, and 9 used decimal approximations for trigonometric functions from the start. This led to slightly less accurate results like `9.526` Angstrom. While close, this demonstrates the risk of early rounding.\n\n### 4. Consensus and Conclusion\n*   There is a strong consensus among the agents who used precise calculation methods (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) that the numerical answer is approximately **9.54 Angstrom**.\n*   The minor deviations in some answers are attributable to rounding errors.\n*   The simplification used by Agent 1 provides the most confident and straightforward path to the correct answer.\n\n### 5.

Select the Correct Formula\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nThis formula is correctly identified by most of the candidate answers.\n\n### 3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nA crucial step for accuracy and simplicity is to substitute the Miller indices `h=1, k=1, l=1` into the formula before performing numerical calculations.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these values, the formula becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3\\sin^2\\alpha + 6(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\\cos^2\\alpha+2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nAs shown in Answer 1, the numerator simplifies to `3(1 - cosα)²` and the denominator's volumetric term `(1-3cos²α+2cos³α)` can be factored into `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`. This leads to a much simpler and more robust formula for the (111) plane:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3(1 - \\cos\\alpha)^2}{a^2(1-\\cos\\alpha)^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{a^2(1+2\\cos\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nUsing this simplified formula avoids many potential rounding errors associated with the more complex terms in the general formula.\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\nSubstitute these values:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{10^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{3}{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})} $$\nNow, solve for `d_111`:\n$$ d_{111}^2 = \\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3} $$\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 (1 + \\sqrt{3})}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value using `√3 ≈ 1.73205`:\n$$ d_{111} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 1.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{\\frac{2.73205}{3}} = 10 \\sqrt{0.91068...} $$\n$$ d_{111} \\approx 10 \\times 0.954297... \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\n\n### 5.

This confirms the correctness of the calculation.\n*   **Inconsistent Conclusions:** Several answers (e.g., 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13) calculate the correct value of ~9.54 Å but then select the wrong option letter (e.g., choosing B for 9.08 Å or C for 10.05 Å). This indicates a failure to correctly map the result to the provided options.\n*   **Option Reordering:** Some answers (e.g., 1, 5, 9) reorder the options in their explanation, leading them to choose a letter like A or C, which corresponds to 9.54 Å in their own list but not in the original prompt's list.\n\nBased on the original options provided:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.
