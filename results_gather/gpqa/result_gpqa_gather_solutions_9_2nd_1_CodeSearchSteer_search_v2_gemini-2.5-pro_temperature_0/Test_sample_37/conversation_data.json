Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step organic synthesis requires a specific, logical sequence of reagent additions.\n*   The reaction involves creating a nucleophile, reacting it with an electrophile, and then hydrolyzing the intermediate.\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation.** A strong base is needed to deprotonate the α-carbon. **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong, bulky base perfect for this. It is used in a solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophile (an enamine or aza-enolate) attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The resulting intermediate (a new iminium salt) is hydrolyzed back to a ketone using an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n\nThe only chemically correct sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents: `(i) LDA, DME`, then `(ii) CH₃CH₂I`, and finally `(iii) H₃O⁺`.\nLet's examine the sequences in the options:\n*   **Options A and C** list the sequence as `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. This is the **correct** sequence.\n*   **Options B and D** list the sequence as `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺`. This is **incorrect** because adding the strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) in consecutive steps without an intermediate reaction would cause them to neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation.\n\nBased on the reagent sequence alone, we can eliminate options B and D.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\nNow we must determine the product of the reaction with the correct sequence.\n*   **Deprotonation:** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two α-carbons: C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). LDA is a bulky base and will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the **C1 methyl group**. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting nucleophile attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed to the final ketone. The carbon skeleton will be `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (heptane). The carbonyl group is at position 4. The name of the product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Select the Final Answer**\nWe need the option with both the correct reagent sequence and the correct product.\n*   **Option A:** Correct sequence, but incorrect product (pentan-2-one).\n*   **Option C:** Correct sequence (`(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`) and correct product (`heptan-4-one`).\n\nTherefore, option C is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone. The goal is to add an ethyl group (from `CH3CH2I`) to the pentan-2-one carbon skeleton.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nA multi-step synthesis like this requires a specific order of operations.\n*   **(i) Formation of the Nucleophile:** First, a strong base is needed to deprotonate the starting material at the α-carbon, creating a nucleophile (an enamine or an enolate). **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base ideal for this purpose. It is used in a suitable solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **(ii) Alkylation:** Second, the electrophile, **CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide)**, is added. The nucleophile formed in the first step attacks the ethyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **(iii) Hydrolysis:** Third, an aqueous acid workup (**H3O+**) is performed. This step hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sequence of reagent addition is critical. The base (LDA) and acid (H3O+) cannot be present at the same time, as they would neutralize each other. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`. This eliminates options C and D, which show an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from pentan-2-one: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   This ketone has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   LDA is a sterically bulky base. It preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the methyl group at C1. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   The ethyl group from ethyl iodide is then added to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH3`) becomes a propyl group (`-CH2-CH2CH3`) after alkylation.\n*   The resulting carbon skeleton is `CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4.\n*   Therefore, the final product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe must select the option that has both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A**: `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`; `B = heptan-4-one`. This matches our analysis perfectly. The reagent sequence is chemically sound, and the product is correct.\n*   **Option B**: The product is incorrect. It shows the starting material, implying no reaction occurred.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent sequence is chemically incorrect.\n*   **Option D**: Both the reagent sequence and the product are incorrect.\n\nThus, option A is the only choice that correctly describes the reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The reagents provided in the options (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) indicate that the overall reaction is an **alpha-alkylation of a ketone**.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nAn alpha-alkylation reaction of this type must proceed in a specific sequence of steps:\n*   **Step (i): Formation of a Nucleophile.** A strong base is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl group (or its iminium equivalent). This creates a nucleophilic species (an enolate or enamine). LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base suitable for this purpose, and DME (dimethoxyethane) is an appropriate solvent. This step must be performed first.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile formed in step (i) attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is the alkylating agent `CH3CH2I` (iodoethane). This step must occur after the nucleophile is formed but before any quenching agent is added.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup (`H3O+`) is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone, yielding the final product.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically logical sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents: `(i) LDA, DME`, followed by `(ii) CH3CH2I`, and finally `(iii) H3O+`. Any option that groups these reagents together in a single step is incorrect because the reagents would react with each other in undesirable ways (e.g., the acid would neutralize the base).\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\nLet's trace the formation of the product:\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   This ketone has two different alpha-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   LDA is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. It preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, which is the **methyl group at C1**. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) from the alkylating agent `CH3CH2I` is then added to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH3`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH2-CH2CH3`).\n*   The resulting ketone has the structure: `CH3CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   To name this compound, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons, so it's a heptanone). Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The name of the product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Select the Correct Option**\nWe need the option that has both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Reagent Sequence:** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`\n*   **Product:** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on the analysis of the candidate answers:\n*   Options with `pentan-2-one` as the product are incorrect because they ignore the alkylation step.\n*   Options with an incorrect reagent sequence (i.e., not sequential) are chemically unsound.\n*   The only option that correctly combines the sequential addition of reagents with the final product, heptan-4-one, is the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction and determines the correct option.\n    The reaction is an alpha-alkylation of a ketone derivative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the reagent sequence.\n    # The reaction requires three distinct steps:\n    # (i) Deprotonation with a strong base (LDA) to form a nucleophile.\n    # (ii) Alkylation with an electrophile (CH3CH2I).\n    # (iii) Hydrolysis with acid (H3O+) to get the final ketone.\n    # These steps must be sequential.

Comparing this with the provided options, the correct choice combines the proper sequence and product.\nThe final answer is C.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The name indicates it is derived from pentan-2-one and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA successful multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **(i) Base for Deprotonation:** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. A strong base like **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the activating group (the C=N⁺). **DME (dimethoxyethane)** is a suitable solvent.\n*   **(ii) Alkylation:** The nucleophile formed in the first step then reacts with an electrophile. Here, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)** is the alkylating agent, which will add an ethyl group.\n*   **(iii) Hydrolysis:** The final step is to convert the intermediate back into a ketone. This is done with an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents. Any option that suggests mixing the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step is incorrect, as they would neutralize each other. The correct sequence is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The starting iminium salt has two α-carbons that can be deprotonated: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a bulky base, so it will preferentially deprotonate the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control. This forms a kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n2.  **Alkylation:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks ethyl iodide. The ethyl group adds to the C1 carbon. The new carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The resulting iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺, converting the C=N⁺ group to a C=O group.\n4.  **Final Product:** The final product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. This is a symmetrical ketone with a 7-carbon chain. Numbering from either end gives the carbonyl group position 4. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** The reagent sequence is incorrect (mixing reagents in step ii), and the product is incorrect (no alkylation occurred).\n*   **B) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one:** The reagent sequence is chemically correct and sequential. The final product is also correct based on our analysis.\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** The reagent sequence is correct, but the product is incorrect.\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one:** The product is correct, but the reagent sequence is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that provides both the correct, chemically sound sequence of reagents and the correct final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃) and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine.\n*   **Reagents:** The options list LDA (a strong base), CH₃CH₂I (an alkylating agent), and H₃O⁺ (for hydrolysis). This combination of reagents is used for the α-alkylation of a ketone.\n*   **Overall Reaction:** The process is the alkylation of the pentan-2-one carbon skeleton with an ethyl group, followed by hydrolysis to return to a ketone.\n\n**2. Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\n*   **Step (i) - Deprotonation:** The iminium salt has two sets of acidic protons on the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=N⁺ bond. These are at the C1 (methyl) and C3 (methylene) positions of the original pentan-2-one skeleton.\n    *   `[CH₃(C1)-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂(C3)HCH₂CH₃]`\n    *   **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong but sterically bulky base. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. This is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n    *   Deprotonation at C1 forms the kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine is a nucleophile. The terminal carbon of the double bond (`CH₂=`) attacks the electrophilic carbon of ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂-I`).\n    *   An ethyl group is added to the C1 carbon. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   This forms a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the new iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and replaced with a C=O bond.\n    *   The final ketone product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Naming the Product (B):** The product has a propyl group on each side of the carbonyl. The longest carbon chain is 7 carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4. The product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\n*   This multi-step synthesis requires the reagents to be added in a specific order.\n    1.  First, the base (LDA) must be added to create the nucleophile (the enamine).\n    2.  Second, the electrophile (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.\n    3.  Third, the reaction is quenched and the intermediate is hydrolyzed with acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   Adding the base and acid together would result in neutralization, preventing the reaction. Therefore, the steps must be separate.\n*   The correct sequence is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's compare our findings with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Incorrect reagent sequence. It incorrectly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n*   **B) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Correct.** The reagent sequence is chemically sound and sequential. The final product, heptan-4-one, is also correct.\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Incorrect reagent sequence and incorrect product. Pentan-2-one is the starting ketone, not the final product of an alkylation.\n*   **D) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Correct reagent sequence, but incorrect product.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that correctly identifies both the logical sequence of reagents and the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of pentan-2-one with the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an alpha-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **Step (i) - Formation of a Nucleophile:** The reaction begins by creating a nucleophile from the starting material. `LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)` is a strong, non-nucleophilic base used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group. This deprotonation forms a neutral, nucleophilic enamine. `DME (dimethoxyethane)` is an appropriate solvent for this step.\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the first step attacks an electrophile. `CH3CH2I (iodoethane)` is an alkylating agent that provides an electrophilic ethyl group. This step must occur after the nucleophile has been formed.\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** After alkylation, a new, larger iminium salt is formed. This intermediate is hydrolyzed back to a ketone using an aqueous acid workup, represented by `H3O+`.\n\nThe only chemically sound procedure is to perform these three steps sequentially. The sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` correctly represents this process. The sequences in options C and D, which suggest adding the acid (H3O+) at the same time as the alkylating agent, are incorrect because the acid would neutralize the base/enamine and prevent the alkylation reaction. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**3. Identification of the Product (B)**\nNow we must determine the final product resulting from this correct sequence.\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from pentan-2-one: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`. It has two different α-carbons, at position 1 (a -CH3 group) and position 3 (a -CH2- group).\n*   LDA is a sterically bulky base. It will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is the methyl group at C1. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   The enamine forms with the double bond between C1 and C2: `CH2=C(NR2)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   This enamine attacks ethyl iodide, adding the ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group is thus converted into a propyl group (`CH3CH2-CH2-`).\n*   The resulting carbon skeleton after alkylation and hydrolysis is `CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4. The product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe are looking for the option with both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A:** Has the correct sequence but the wrong product (pentan-2-one).\n*   **Option B:** Has the correct sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` and the correct product `heptan-4-one`.\n*   **Option C:** Has an incorrect sequence.\n*   **Option D:** Has an incorrect sequence and product.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only choice that is fully correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Type and Starting Material**\nThe reaction starts with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`, which is an iminium salt. This species is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis, a method for the α-alkylation of a ketone. The carbon skeleton is derived from **pentan-2-one**. The reagents provided—a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I), and an acid for hydrolysis (H₃O⁺)—confirm that the overall transformation is an α-alkylation of the pentan-2-one skeleton.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nFor this multi-step synthesis to be successful, the reagents must be added in a specific, sequential order.\n*   **Step (i): Formation of the Nucleophile.** A strong base is required to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group (or its iminium equivalent) to create a nucleophile. The sequence must begin with the base, **LDA**, in a suitable solvent like **DME**.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile created in the first step is then reacted with the electrophile, which is the alkylating agent **CH₃CH₂I**. This step must occur after the nucleophile is formed and before any acid is added.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** The final step is to add aqueous acid, **H₃O⁺**, to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone. This step must be last, as adding acid earlier would neutralize the base and/or the nucleophile, preventing the reaction.\n\nBased on this, the only chemically correct sequence is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and D, which propose an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). It has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   The base used is **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, which is known to be very bulky. Due to its steric hindrance, it preferentially removes a proton from the less-hindered α-carbon. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   In pentan-2-one, the C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group. Therefore, LDA will deprotonate C1.\n*   The alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I**, will then add an ethyl group to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   The final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   To name this ketone, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons, a heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4.\n*   Therefore, the final product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe must select the option that has both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A:** Incorrect sequence, incorrect product.\n*   **Option B:** Correct sequence `(A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺)` and correct product `(B = heptan-4-one)`.\n*   **Option C:** Correct sequence, incorrect product.\n*   **Option D:** Incorrect sequence, correct product.\n\nOnly option B is entirely correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The name indicates it is derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Sequence (A)**\nThe reagents provided are LDA, DME, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺. A successful multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical sequence of reagent addition.\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, and sterically hindered base. Its purpose is to deprotonate the starting material to create a nucleophile. DME (dimethoxyethane) is a suitable solvent.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Iodoethane is an alkylating agent (an electrophile). It will be attacked by the nucleophile created in the first step.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** Aqueous acid is used in the final workup step to hydrolyze the intermediate back into a ketone.\n\nThe correct procedure is to perform these steps sequentially: 1st, create the nucleophile with the base; 2nd, add the electrophile for alkylation; 3rd, hydrolyze the intermediate to get the final product. Any option that suggests mixing these reagents (e.g., adding the base and acid at the same time) is chemically incorrect. Therefore, the only valid sequence for A is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D, which show an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Predict the Product (B)**\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   **Step 1 (Deprotonation):** The iminium salt has two acidic α-carbon positions (C1 and C3 from the original pentan-2-one). Because LDA is a bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control and forms the kinetic enamine.\n*   **Step 2 (Alkylation):** The kinetic enamine is nucleophilic at the C1 carbon. It attacks the ethyl group of iodoethane (CH₃CH₂I), forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The original C1 methyl group is now a propyl group (`CH₃CH₂-CH₂-`).\n*   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The resulting larger iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺. The C=N⁺ group is converted back to a C=O group.\n\nThe final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. This is a symmetrical 7-carbon ketone. Numbering the chain from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one:** This option has the correct, sequential order of reagents (A) and the correct final product (B).\n*   **B) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** The sequence of reagents is correct, but the product is wrong. Pentan-2-one is the precursor, not the final product of an alkylation reaction.\n*   **C) A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one:** The product is correct, but the reagent sequence is chemically incorrect.\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** Both the reagent sequence and the product are incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the only choice that presents both a chemically sound reaction sequence and the correct final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an **iminium salt**, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine** (`CH₃NHCH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents listed in the options (`LDA`, `CH₃CH₂I`, `H₃O⁺`) are characteristic of an α-alkylation reaction. The overall transformation is the addition of an ethyl group to the pentan-2-one carbon skeleton.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct steps:\n\n*   **Step (i): Deprotonation with LDA.**\n    *   The iminium salt has acidic protons on the carbons adjacent (alpha, α) to the `C=N⁺` bond. These correspond to the C1 (methyl) and C3 (methylene) positions of the original pentan-2-one.\n    *   `LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)` is a very strong, but sterically hindered (bulky) base. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon. This is the C1 methyl group. This process is known as kinetic control.\n    *   Deprotonation of the iminium salt at C1 forms the *kinetic enamine*: `CH₂=C(N(CH₃)(Et))-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation with Ethyl Iodide.**\n    *   The enamine formed is a nucleophile. The nucleophilic attack occurs from the α-carbon (`CH₂=`) onto the electrophilic ethyl group of iodoethane (`CH₃CH₂-I`).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, adding the ethyl group to the C1 position. The result is a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺(CH₃)(Et))-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis with H₃O⁺.**\n    *   The final step is the addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`), which hydrolyzes the iminium salt. The `C=N⁺` bond is cleaved and replaced with a carbonyl (`C=O`) group.\n    *   The final ketone product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Naming the Product (B):** The resulting ketone has a 7-carbon chain (heptane) with the carbonyl group at position 4. Therefore, the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\n*   A multi-step synthesis requires a specific, sequential addition of reagents.\n*   First, the nucleophile must be formed by adding the base (LDA) in a suitable solvent (DME).\n*   Second, the electrophile (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.\n*   Third, the reaction is quenched and the final product is formed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   This correct, sequential procedure is represented as: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   This option has the correct, chemically sound sequence of reagents (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   The reagent sequence is incorrect. Adding the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time as the base and alkylating agent would prevent the reaction.\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence is incorrect, and the product is incorrect (it shows no alkylation).\n\n*   **D) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence is correct, but the product is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies both the reaction procedure and the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents provided in the options are LDA (a strong, bulky base), CH₃CH₂I (an alkylating agent), and H₃O⁺ (for hydrolysis).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of a ketone derivative and reagents points to an α-alkylation reaction. The overall goal is to add an alkyl group (in this case, an ethyl group from CH₃CH₂I) to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group of the original ketone.\n\n**2. Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct, sequential steps:\n\n*   **Step (i): Deprotonation.** The strong base, LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide), is added. The iminium salt has two sets of acidic protons on the carbons alpha to the C=N⁺ bond (at C1 and C3 of the original pentan-2-one skeleton). Because LDA is a large, bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. This is the methyl group at C1 (kinetic control). This deprotonation forms a nucleophilic enamine.\n    *   `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, iodoethane (CH₃CH₂I). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon. This forms a new, larger iminium salt.\n    *   `Enamine + CH₃CH₂-I → [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]`\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) is added to hydrolyze the new iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and replaced with a C=O bond, regenerating a ketone.\n    *   `New Iminium Salt + H₂O → CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Identifying Product B:** The final ketone product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. This is a symmetrical ketone with a 7-carbon chain. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor a multi-step synthesis like this, the reagents must be added in a specific order. Adding them all at once would cause undesired side reactions (e.g., the strong base LDA would be instantly neutralized by the strong acid H₃O⁺).\n*   The correct procedure is:\n    1.  Add the base (LDA) in a suitable solvent (DME) to form the nucleophile.\n    2.  Add the alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I).\n    3.  Add the acid (H₃O⁺) for the final workup/hydrolysis.\n*   This corresponds to the sequence: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's match our findings with the provided options:\n\n*   **A)** `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+, B = heptan-4-one` - The reagent sequence is incorrect because it mixes the solvent, alkylating agent, and hydrolysis agent in a single step.\n*   **B)** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine` - The reagent sequence is correct, but the product is wrong. Pentan-2-one is the starting ketone, not the final product of an alkylation.\n*   **C)** `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine` - Both the reagent sequence and the product are incorrect.\n*   **D)** `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O+ B = heptan-4-one` - This option has both the correct, sequential addition of reagents (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\nTherefore, option D is the only choice that accurately describes the chemical transformation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of pentan-2-one (a 5-carbon ketone) and N-methylethanamine (a secondary amine). The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition. Let's analyze the sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.\n*   **Step (i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, and sterically hindered base. Its purpose is to deprotonate the iminium salt at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N⁺ group) to form a nucleophilic enamine. DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is a suitable polar aprotic solvent. This is the correct first step to create the nucleophile.\n*   **Step (ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Iodoethane is an alkylating agent (an electrophile). The enamine formed in step (i) will attack the ethyl group of iodoethane, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This is the correct second step.\n*   **Step (iii) H₃O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous workup. Its purpose is to hydrolyze the new, larger iminium salt formed in step (ii) back into a ketone. This is the correct final step.\n\nAny option that does not follow this sequential addition is chemically incorrect. For example, adding the strong base (LDA) and the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time would result in them neutralizing each other, preventing the desired reaction. This eliminates options that group the reagents improperly. The sequence `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺` is the only chemically sound procedure among the choices.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\nLet's trace the formation of the product from the starting pentan-2-one skeleton.\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The iminium salt has two α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group (C1) and the methylene group (C3). Because LDA is a bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enamine attacks ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`). The ethyl group is added to the C1 carbon. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed back to a ketone. The final product's carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n**4. Name the Product and Select the Correct Option**\nThe product `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃` is a symmetrical ketone with a 7-carbon chain. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this analysis:\n*   A) The reagent sequence is written incorrectly, suggesting simultaneous addition of solvent, alkylating agent, and acid.\n*   B) The reagent sequence is incorrect, and the product is incorrect (it shows the starting ketone, implying no reaction).\n*   C) The reagent sequence is correct, but the product is incorrect.\n*   D) **A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one**.

The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct steps:\n\n*   **Step (i) - Deprotonation:** The strong, bulky base LDA is added. It removes a proton from one of the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=N⁺ bond). Pentan-2-one has two α-positions: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. Because LDA is sterically hindered, it preferentially removes a proton from the less-hindered position (the C1 methyl group). This is known as *kinetic control* and it forms the *kinetic enamine* (or aza-enolate).\n    *   `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed is a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon, forming a new, larger iminium salt.\n    *   `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + CH₃CH₂-I → [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]`\n\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** Aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) is added. This hydrolyzes the iminium salt, converting the C=N⁺ group back into a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + H₂O → CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Identifying Product B:** The final ketone is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4. The name of the product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor a multi-step synthesis like this, the reagents must be added in a specific order.\n1.  First, the base (LDA) is added in a suitable solvent (DME) to create the nucleophile.\n2.  Second, the alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.\n3.  Third, the reaction is stopped and the product is isolated by adding an acid/water mixture (H₃O⁺) for hydrolysis.\n\nThe only sequence that represents this correct, stepwise procedure is `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. Any option that mixes these steps (e.g., adding the base and acid together) is chemically incorrect.\n\n**4.

This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   The carbon skeleton comes from **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`).\n*   The nitrogen part comes from the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine** (`CH₃-NH-CH₂CH₃`).\nThe reagents listed (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) indicate the overall reaction is an α-alkylation of the original ketone, followed by hydrolysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nA multi-step organic synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of a Nucleophile.** A strong base is needed to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl (or iminium) group to create a nucleophile (an enolate or enamine). **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong base used for this purpose. It is used in a solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophile formed in step 1 attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is **CH₃CH₂I (iodoethane)**. This step forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** An acidic workup with **H₃O⁺** is required to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back to the final ketone product.\n\nA chemically sound procedure requires these three steps to be performed sequentially. Adding the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time would cause them to neutralize each other, preventing the reaction. Therefore, the correct sequence for A must be **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D, which list an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\n*   **Deprotonation:** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a sterically bulky base, so it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position (the C1 methyl group). This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting nucleophile attacks ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`), adding an ethyl group to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed to the final ketone. The resulting carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** This is a symmetrical ketone with a seven-carbon chain (heptane). The carbonyl group is at the 4th position.

Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The reaction involves reagents characteristic of an α-alkylation of a ketone: a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I), and an acid for hydrolysis (H₃O⁺). The overall transformation is the addition of an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis of this type requires a specific, sequential addition of reagents.\n*   First, a nucleophile must be created.\n*   Second, the nucleophile reacts with the electrophile (the alkylating agent).\n*   Third, the reaction is worked up (hydrolyzed) to yield the final neutral product.\n\nThe correct sequence is therefore:\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** The strong base LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) in a solvent (DME) is used to deprotonate the iminium salt, forming a nucleophilic enamine.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** The alkylating agent (ethyl iodide) is added to react with the enamine.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** An aqueous acid workup hydrolyzes the resulting intermediate to the final ketone.\n\nThis sequential addition is represented as `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. Sequences that suggest adding the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time as the base or the enamine intermediate are chemically incorrect, as the acid would neutralize the base/nucleophile. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\nThe reaction proceeds via the following mechanism:\n*   **Step 1: Deprotonation.** The iminium salt `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]` has two acidic α-carbon positions (C1 and C3). LDA is a sterically bulky base and will preferentially remove a proton from the less hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control and forms the kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂-I`). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon. This forms a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The new iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺, converting the `C=N⁺` group back to a `C=O` group.\n\nThe final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest possible number.

Analyze the Reaction Type and Reagents**\n\nThe reaction starts with an iminium salt, `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`, and involves the reagents LDA, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺. This set of reagents and starting material is characteristic of a Stork enamine alkylation, a multi-step synthesis used to add an alkyl group to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) of a ketone.\n\nThe process requires three distinct, sequential steps:\n*   **Step 1: Deprotonation.** A strong base is needed to remove an α-proton to create a nucleophile (an enamine).\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The newly formed nucleophile attacks an electrophile (an alkyl halide).\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The intermediate is treated with aqueous acid to regenerate the ketone.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor the reaction to be successful, the reagents must be added in a specific order.\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** First, the strong base, Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), is added in a suitable solvent like dimethoxyethane (DME) to deprotonate the iminium salt and form the nucleophilic enamine.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Second, the alkylating agent, iodoethane (ethyl iodide), is added. The enamine attacks the ethyl iodide, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and a new, larger iminium salt.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** Third, an acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺) is performed to hydrolyze the iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\nAny sequence that mixes these steps, for example, by adding the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time, is chemically incorrect because they would neutralize each other. Therefore, the only correct sequence is `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Starting Ketone Skeleton:** The name \"pentan-2-ylidene\" indicates the reaction starts with the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Site of Reaction:** Pentan-2-one has two α-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a sterically bulky base, so it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) from the iodoethane is added to the C1 position. The original `CH₃-` group at C1 becomes a `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-` (propyl) group.\n*   **Final Structure:** The resulting ketone has a propyl group on one side of the carbonyl and a propyl group on the other side: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain has seven carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4.

    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction, here is the breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reaction Type**: The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, an activated intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**. The reagents provided (LDA, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺) are characteristic of a Stork enamine synthesis, specifically the α-alkylation of a ketone. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n2.  **Reagent Sequence (A)**: A multi-step synthesis requires a precise order of reagent addition to avoid unwanted side reactions.\n    *   **Step (i) - Nucleophile Formation**: The reaction must start by creating a nucleophile. The strong base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group. This must be the first step. **DME** is the solvent.\n    *   **Step (ii) - Alkylation**: The nucleophile formed in the first step attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I** (iodoethane). This must be the second step.\n    *   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis**: Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the new iminium salt intermediate back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n\n    **Careful Point**: The sequence is critical. Adding the strong base (LDA) and the strong acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step would cause them to neutralize each other, preventing the alkylation. Therefore, the only chemically correct sequence is the sequential addition: `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. This immediately eliminates options B and D from consideration as they propose an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n3.  **Product (B)**:\n    *   **Regioselectivity of Deprotonation**: The starting ketone, pentan-2-one, has two different α-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, LDA, is known for being very large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n    *   **Alkylation and Hydrolysis**: The ethyl group from CH₃CH₂I is added to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   **Naming the Product**: The longest carbon chain in the product has 7 carbons (a heptane derivative). The carbonyl group is at position 4. Therefore, the name of product B is **heptan-4-one**. This eliminates options A and D, which list the incorrect product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nTo be the correct answer, the option must have both the correct reagent sequence (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n*   **Correct Sequence (A)**: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`\n*   **Correct Product (B)**: `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` **B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine** — The sequence is correct, but the product is incorrect.\n*   B) `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+` **B = heptan-4-one** — The sequence is incorrect, but the product is correct.\n*   C) `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` **B = heptan-4-one** — Both the sequence and the product are correct.\n*   D) `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+` **B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine** — Both the sequence and the product are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only choice that accurately describes the reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"

This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step organic synthesis requires a specific, logical sequence of reagent additions.\n*   The reaction involves creating a nucleophile, reacting it with an electrophile, and then hydrolyzing the intermediate.\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation.** A strong base is needed to deprotonate the α-carbon. **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong, bulky base perfect for this. It is used in a solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophile (an enamine or aza-enolate) attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The resulting intermediate (a new iminium salt) is hydrolyzed back to a ketone using an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n\nThe only chemically correct sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents: `(i) LDA, DME`, then `(ii) CH₃CH₂I`, and finally `(iii) H₃O⁺`.\nLet's examine the sequences in the options:\n*   **Options A and C** list the sequence as `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. This is the **correct** sequence.\n*   **Options B and D** list the sequence as `(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺`. This is **incorrect** because adding the strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) in consecutive steps without an intermediate reaction would cause them to neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation.\n\nBased on the reagent sequence alone, we can eliminate options B and D.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\nNow we must determine the product of the reaction with the correct sequence.\n*   **Deprotonation:** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two α-carbons: C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). LDA is a bulky base and will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the **C1 methyl group**. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting nucleophile attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed to the final ketone. The carbon skeleton will be `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (heptane). The carbonyl group is at position 4.

The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone. The goal is to add an ethyl group (from `CH3CH2I`) to the pentan-2-one carbon skeleton.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nA multi-step synthesis like this requires a specific order of operations.\n*   **(i) Formation of the Nucleophile:** First, a strong base is needed to deprotonate the starting material at the α-carbon, creating a nucleophile (an enamine or an enolate). **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base ideal for this purpose. It is used in a suitable solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **(ii) Alkylation:** Second, the electrophile, **CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide)**, is added. The nucleophile formed in the first step attacks the ethyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **(iii) Hydrolysis:** Third, an aqueous acid workup (**H3O+**) is performed. This step hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sequence of reagent addition is critical. The base (LDA) and acid (H3O+) cannot be present at the same time, as they would neutralize each other. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`. This eliminates options C and D, which show an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from pentan-2-one: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   This ketone has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   LDA is a sterically bulky base. It preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the methyl group at C1. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   The ethyl group from ethyl iodide is then added to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH3`) becomes a propyl group (`-CH2-CH2CH3`) after alkylation.\n*   The resulting carbon skeleton is `CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4.\n*   Therefore, the final product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe must select the option that has both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A**: `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`; `B = heptan-4-one`. This matches our analysis perfectly. The reagent sequence is chemically sound, and the product is correct.\n*   **Option B**: The product is incorrect. It shows the starting material, implying no reaction occurred.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent sequence is chemically incorrect.\n*   **Option D**: Both the reagent sequence and the product are incorrect.\n\nThus, option A is the only choice that correctly describes the reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The reagents provided in the options (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) indicate that the overall reaction is an **alpha-alkylation of a ketone**.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nAn alpha-alkylation reaction of this type must proceed in a specific sequence of steps:\n*   **Step (i): Formation of a Nucleophile.** A strong base is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl group (or its iminium equivalent). This creates a nucleophilic species (an enolate or enamine). LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base suitable for this purpose, and DME (dimethoxyethane) is an appropriate solvent. This step must be performed first.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile formed in step (i) attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is the alkylating agent `CH3CH2I` (iodoethane). This step must occur after the nucleophile is formed but before any quenching agent is added.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup (`H3O+`) is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone, yielding the final product.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically logical sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents: `(i) LDA, DME`, followed by `(ii) CH3CH2I`, and finally `(iii) H3O+`. Any option that groups these reagents together in a single step is incorrect because the reagents would react with each other in undesirable ways (e.g., the acid would neutralize the base).\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\nLet's trace the formation of the product:\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   This ketone has two different alpha-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   LDA is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. It preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, which is the **methyl group at C1**. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) from the alkylating agent `CH3CH2I` is then added to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH3`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH2-CH2CH3`).\n*   The resulting ketone has the structure: `CH3CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3`.\n*   To name this compound, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons, so it's a heptanone).

This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The name indicates it is derived from pentan-2-one and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA successful multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **(i) Base for Deprotonation:** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. A strong base like **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the activating group (the C=N⁺). **DME (dimethoxyethane)** is a suitable solvent.\n*   **(ii) Alkylation:** The nucleophile formed in the first step then reacts with an electrophile. Here, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)** is the alkylating agent, which will add an ethyl group.\n*   **(iii) Hydrolysis:** The final step is to convert the intermediate back into a ketone. This is done with an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence is the sequential addition of these reagents. Any option that suggests mixing the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step is incorrect, as they would neutralize each other. The correct sequence is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The starting iminium salt has two α-carbons that can be deprotonated: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a bulky base, so it will preferentially deprotonate the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control. This forms a kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n2.  **Alkylation:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks ethyl iodide. The ethyl group adds to the C1 carbon. The new carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The resulting iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺, converting the C=N⁺ group to a C=O group.\n4.  **Final Product:** The final product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. This is a symmetrical ketone with a 7-carbon chain. Numbering from either end gives the carbonyl group position 4.

This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃) and the secondary amine N-methylethanamine.\n*   **Reagents:** The options list LDA (a strong base), CH₃CH₂I (an alkylating agent), and H₃O⁺ (for hydrolysis).

Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\n*   **Step (i) - Deprotonation:** The iminium salt has two sets of acidic protons on the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=N⁺ bond. These are at the C1 (methyl) and C3 (methylene) positions of the original pentan-2-one skeleton.\n    *   `[CH₃(C1)-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂(C3)HCH₂CH₃]`\n    *   **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong but sterically bulky base. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. This is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n    *   Deprotonation at C1 forms the kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine is a nucleophile. The terminal carbon of the double bond (`CH₂=`) attacks the electrophilic carbon of ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂-I`).\n    *   An ethyl group is added to the C1 carbon. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   This forms a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the new iminium salt. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved and replaced with a C=O bond.\n    *   The final ketone product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Naming the Product (B):** The product has a propyl group on each side of the carbonyl. The longest carbon chain is 7 carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4. The product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\n*   This multi-step synthesis requires the reagents to be added in a specific order.\n    1.  First, the base (LDA) must be added to create the nucleophile (the enamine).\n    2.  Second, the electrophile (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.\n    3.  Third, the reaction is quenched and the intermediate is hydrolyzed with acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   Adding the base and acid together would result in neutralization, preventing the reaction. Therefore, the steps must be separate.\n*   The correct sequence is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's compare our findings with the provided options:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Incorrect reagent sequence. It incorrectly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n*   **B) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Correct.** The reagent sequence is chemically sound and sequential. The final product, heptan-4-one, is also correct.\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Incorrect reagent sequence and incorrect product. Pentan-2-one is the starting ketone, not the final product of an alkylation.\n*   **D) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Correct reagent sequence, but incorrect product.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that correctly identifies both the logical sequence of reagents and the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of pentan-2-one with the secondary amine N-methylethanamine. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an alpha-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **Step (i) - Formation of a Nucleophile:** The reaction begins by creating a nucleophile from the starting material. `LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)` is a strong, non-nucleophilic base used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group. This deprotonation forms a neutral, nucleophilic enamine. `DME (dimethoxyethane)` is an appropriate solvent for this step.\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the first step attacks an electrophile. `CH3CH2I (iodoethane)` is an alkylating agent that provides an electrophilic ethyl group. This step must occur after the nucleophile has been formed.\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** After alkylation, a new, larger iminium salt is formed. This intermediate is hydrolyzed back to a ketone using an aqueous acid workup, represented by `H3O+`.\n\nThe only chemically sound procedure is to perform these three steps sequentially. The sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` correctly represents this process. The sequences in options C and D, which suggest adding the acid (H3O+) at the same time as the alkylating agent, are incorrect because the acid would neutralize the base/enamine and prevent the alkylation reaction. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**3. Identification of the Product (B)**\nNow we must determine the final product resulting from this correct sequence.\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is from pentan-2-one: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`. It has two different α-carbons, at position 1 (a -CH3 group) and position 3 (a -CH2- group).\n*   LDA is a sterically bulky base. It will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is the methyl group at C1. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   The enamine forms with the double bond between C1 and C2: `CH2=C(NR2)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   This enamine attacks ethyl iodide, adding the ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group is thus converted into a propyl group (`CH3CH2-CH2-`).\n*   The resulting carbon skeleton after alkylation and hydrolysis is `CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3`.\n*   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4. The product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe are looking for the option with both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A:** Has the correct sequence but the wrong product (pentan-2-one).\n*   **Option B:** Has the correct sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+` and the correct product `heptan-4-one`.\n*   **Option C:** Has an incorrect sequence.\n*   **Option D:** Has an incorrect sequence and product.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only choice that is fully correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Type and Starting Material**\nThe reaction starts with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`, which is an iminium salt. This species is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis, a method for the α-alkylation of a ketone. The carbon skeleton is derived from **pentan-2-one**. The reagents provided—a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I), and an acid for hydrolysis (H₃O⁺)—confirm that the overall transformation is an α-alkylation of the pentan-2-one skeleton.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nFor this multi-step synthesis to be successful, the reagents must be added in a specific, sequential order.\n*   **Step (i): Formation of the Nucleophile.** A strong base is required to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl group (or its iminium equivalent) to create a nucleophile. The sequence must begin with the base, **LDA**, in a suitable solvent like **DME**.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile created in the first step is then reacted with the electrophile, which is the alkylating agent **CH₃CH₂I**. This step must occur after the nucleophile is formed and before any acid is added.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** The final step is to add aqueous acid, **H₃O⁺**, to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone. This step must be last, as adding acid earlier would neutralize the base and/or the nucleophile, preventing the reaction.\n\nBased on this, the only chemically correct sequence is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and D, which propose an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\n*   The starting ketone skeleton is **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). It has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   The base used is **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, which is known to be very bulky. Due to its steric hindrance, it preferentially removes a proton from the less-hindered α-carbon. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   In pentan-2-one, the C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group. Therefore, LDA will deprotonate C1.\n*   The alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I**, will then add an ethyl group to this C1 position.\n*   The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   The final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   To name this ketone, we find the longest carbon chain (7 carbons, a heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4.\n*   Therefore, the final product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe must select the option that has both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   **Option A:** Incorrect sequence, incorrect product.\n*   **Option B:** Correct sequence `(A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺)` and correct product `(B = heptan-4-one)`.\n*   **Option C:** Correct sequence, incorrect product.\n*   **Option D:** Incorrect sequence, correct product.\n\nOnly option B is entirely correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The name indicates it is derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**. The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Sequence (A)**\nThe reagents provided are LDA, DME, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺. A successful multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical sequence of reagent addition.\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, and sterically hindered base. Its purpose is to deprotonate the starting material to create a nucleophile. DME (dimethoxyethane) is a suitable solvent.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Iodoethane is an alkylating agent (an electrophile). It will be attacked by the nucleophile created in the first step.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** Aqueous acid is used in the final workup step to hydrolyze the intermediate back into a ketone.\n\nThe correct procedure is to perform these steps sequentially: 1st, create the nucleophile with the base; 2nd, add the electrophile for alkylation; 3rd, hydrolyze the intermediate to get the final product. Any option that suggests mixing these reagents (e.g., adding the base and acid at the same time) is chemically incorrect. Therefore, the only valid sequence for A is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D, which show an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Predict the Product (B)**\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   **Step 1 (Deprotonation):** The iminium salt has two acidic α-carbon positions (C1 and C3 from the original pentan-2-one). Because LDA is a bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control and forms the kinetic enamine.\n*   **Step 2 (Alkylation):** The kinetic enamine is nucleophilic at the C1 carbon. It attacks the ethyl group of iodoethane (CH₃CH₂I), forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The original C1 methyl group is now a propyl group (`CH₃CH₂-CH₂-`).\n*   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The resulting larger iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺. The C=N⁺ group is converted back to a C=O group.\n\nThe final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. This is a symmetrical 7-carbon ketone. Numbering the chain from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4.

This is an **iminium salt**, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine** (`CH₃NHCH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents listed in the options (`LDA`, `CH₃CH₂I`, `H₃O⁺`) are characteristic of an α-alkylation reaction. The overall transformation is the addition of an ethyl group to the pentan-2-one carbon skeleton.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct steps:\n\n*   **Step (i): Deprotonation with LDA.**\n    *   The iminium salt has acidic protons on the carbons adjacent (alpha, α) to the `C=N⁺` bond. These correspond to the C1 (methyl) and C3 (methylene) positions of the original pentan-2-one.\n    *   `LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)` is a very strong, but sterically hindered (bulky) base. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon. This is the C1 methyl group. This process is known as kinetic control.\n    *   Deprotonation of the iminium salt at C1 forms the *kinetic enamine*: `CH₂=C(N(CH₃)(Et))-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation with Ethyl Iodide.**\n    *   The enamine formed is a nucleophile. The nucleophilic attack occurs from the α-carbon (`CH₂=`) onto the electrophilic ethyl group of iodoethane (`CH₃CH₂-I`).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, adding the ethyl group to the C1 position. The result is a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺(CH₃)(Et))-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis with H₃O⁺.**\n    *   The final step is the addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`), which hydrolyzes the iminium salt. The `C=N⁺` bond is cleaved and replaced with a carbonyl (`C=O`) group.\n    *   The final ketone product is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n*   **Naming the Product (B):** The resulting ketone has a 7-carbon chain (heptane) with the carbonyl group at position 4.

The overall goal is to add an alkyl group (in this case, an ethyl group from CH₃CH₂I) to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group of the original ketone.\n\n**2. Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct, sequential steps:\n\n*   **Step (i): Deprotonation.** The strong base, LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide), is added. The iminium salt has two sets of acidic protons on the carbons alpha to the C=N⁺ bond (at C1 and C3 of the original pentan-2-one skeleton). Because LDA is a large, bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position. This is the methyl group at C1 (kinetic control). This deprotonation forms a nucleophilic enamine.\n    *   `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, iodoethane (CH₃CH₂I). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon. This forms a new, larger iminium salt.\n    *   `Enamine + CH₃CH₂-I → [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]`\n\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) is added to hydrolyze the new iminium salt.

Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor a multi-step synthesis like this, the reagents must be added in a specific order. Adding them all at once would cause undesired side reactions (e.g., the strong base LDA would be instantly neutralized by the strong acid H₃O⁺).\n*   The correct procedure is:\n    1.  Add the base (LDA) in a suitable solvent (DME) to form the nucleophile.\n    2.  Add the alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I).\n    3.

Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the reaction of pentan-2-one (a 5-carbon ketone) and N-methylethanamine (a secondary amine). The overall reaction described by the reagents is an α-alkylation of a ketone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition. Let's analyze the sequence `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.\n*   **Step (i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic, and sterically hindered base. Its purpose is to deprotonate the iminium salt at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N⁺ group) to form a nucleophilic enamine. DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is a suitable polar aprotic solvent. This is the correct first step to create the nucleophile.\n*   **Step (ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Iodoethane is an alkylating agent (an electrophile). The enamine formed in step (i) will attack the ethyl group of iodoethane, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This is the correct second step.\n*   **Step (iii) H₃O⁺:** This represents an acidic aqueous workup. Its purpose is to hydrolyze the new, larger iminium salt formed in step (ii) back into a ketone. This is the correct final step.\n\nAny option that does not follow this sequential addition is chemically incorrect. For example, adding the strong base (LDA) and the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time would result in them neutralizing each other, preventing the desired reaction. This eliminates options that group the reagents improperly. The sequence `A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺` is the only chemically sound procedure among the choices.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\nLet's trace the formation of the product from the starting pentan-2-one skeleton.\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The iminium salt has two α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group (C1) and the methylene group (C3). Because LDA is a bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enamine attacks ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`). The ethyl group is added to the C1 carbon. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed back to a ketone. The final product's carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n\n**4.

This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. It is formed from the ketone **pentan-2-one** and the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine**.\n*   **Reagents:** The options all involve `LDA` (a strong, bulky base), `CH₃CH₂I` (an alkylating agent, ethyl iodide), and `H₃O⁺` (acidic workup for hydrolysis).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of a carbonyl derivative and reagents points to an **α-alkylation reaction**. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Predict the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in three distinct steps:\n\n*   **Step (i) - Deprotonation:** The strong, bulky base LDA is added. It removes a proton from one of the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the C=N⁺ bond). Pentan-2-one has two α-positions: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. Because LDA is sterically hindered, it preferentially removes a proton from the less-hindered position (the C1 methyl group). This is known as *kinetic control* and it forms the *kinetic enamine* (or aza-enolate).\n    *   `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + LDA → CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed is a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon, forming a new, larger iminium salt.\n    *   `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + CH₃CH₂-I → [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]`\n\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** Aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) is added. This hydrolyzes the iminium salt, converting the C=N⁺ group back into a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + H₂O → CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Identifying Product B:** The final ketone is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4. The name of the product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor a multi-step synthesis like this, the reagents must be added in a specific order.\n1.  First, the base (LDA) is added in a suitable solvent (DME) to create the nucleophile.\n2.  Second, the alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I) is added to react with the nucleophile.\n3.  Third, the reaction is stopped and the product is isolated by adding an acid/water mixture (H₃O⁺) for hydrolysis.\n\nThe only sequence that represents this correct, stepwise procedure is `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. Any option that mixes these steps (e.g., adding the base and acid together) is chemically incorrect.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's examine the provided choices based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Reagent sequence is incorrect (steps are improperly grouped). Product is correct.\n*   **B) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Reagent sequence is correct. Product is incorrect (it shows no alkylation).\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Reagent sequence is incorrect. Product is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Reagent sequence is correct.** It shows the proper three-step addition.\n    *   **Product is correct.** It correctly identifies heptan-4-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only choice that provides both the chemically correct sequence of reagents and the correct final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Overall Reaction**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   The carbon skeleton comes from **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`).\n*   The nitrogen part comes from the secondary amine **N-methylethanamine** (`CH₃-NH-CH₂CH₃`).\nThe reagents listed (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) indicate the overall reaction is an α-alkylation of the original ketone, followed by hydrolysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nA multi-step organic synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition.\n*   **Step 1: Formation of a Nucleophile.** A strong base is needed to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the carbonyl (or iminium) group to create a nucleophile (an enolate or enamine). **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is a strong base used for this purpose. It is used in a solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophile formed in step 1 attacks an electrophile. Here, the electrophile is **CH₃CH₂I (iodoethane)**. This step forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** An acidic workup with **H₃O⁺** is required to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back to the final ketone product.\n\nA chemically sound procedure requires these three steps to be performed sequentially. Adding the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time would cause them to neutralize each other, preventing the reaction. Therefore, the correct sequence for A must be **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options C and D, which list an incorrect, non-sequential addition of reagents.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\n*   **Deprotonation:** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a sterically bulky base, so it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position (the C1 methyl group). This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting nucleophile attacks ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂I`), adding an ethyl group to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The intermediate is hydrolyzed to the final ketone. The resulting carbon skeleton is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** This is a symmetrical ketone with a seven-carbon chain (heptane). The carbonyl group is at the 4th position. The IUPAC name is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence (A) is correct.\n    *   The product (B) is incorrect; it implies no alkylation occurred.\n*   **B) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   The reagent sequence (A) is correct.\n    *   The product (B) is correct.\n*   **C) A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   The reagent sequence (A) is incorrect.\n    *   The product (B) is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O+; B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   The reagent sequence (A) is incorrect.\n    *   The product (B) is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option B provides both the correct, chemically sound sequence of reagents and the correct final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in the Stork enamine synthesis. The reaction involves reagents characteristic of an α-alkylation of a ketone: a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I), and an acid for hydrolysis (H₃O⁺). The overall transformation is the addition of an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\nA multi-step synthesis of this type requires a specific, sequential addition of reagents.\n*   First, a nucleophile must be created.\n*   Second, the nucleophile reacts with the electrophile (the alkylating agent).\n*   Third, the reaction is worked up (hydrolyzed) to yield the final neutral product.\n\nThe correct sequence is therefore:\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** The strong base LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) in a solvent (DME) is used to deprotonate the iminium salt, forming a nucleophilic enamine.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** The alkylating agent (ethyl iodide) is added to react with the enamine.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** An aqueous acid workup hydrolyzes the resulting intermediate to the final ketone.\n\nThis sequential addition is represented as `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`. Sequences that suggest adding the acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time as the base or the enamine intermediate are chemically incorrect, as the acid would neutralize the base/nucleophile. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product (B)**\nThe reaction proceeds via the following mechanism:\n*   **Step 1: Deprotonation.** The iminium salt `[CH₃-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]` has two acidic α-carbon positions (C1 and C3). LDA is a sterically bulky base and will preferentially remove a proton from the less hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control and forms the kinetic enamine: `CH₂=C(NR₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the ethyl iodide (`CH₃CH₂-I`). The ethyl group attaches to the C1 carbon. This forms a new, larger iminium salt: `[CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺R₂)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]⁺`.\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The new iminium salt is hydrolyzed by H₃O⁺, converting the `C=N⁺` group back to a `C=O` group.\n\nThe final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain (7 carbons = heptane) and number it to give the carbonyl group the lowest possible number. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4. Therefore, the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe must select the option with both the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n*   Option A has the correct sequence but the wrong product.\n*   **Option B has the correct sequence (`(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`) and the correct product (`heptan-4-one`).**\n*   Option C has an incorrect sequence and an incorrect product.\n*   Option D has an incorrect sequence, although the product is correct.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction Type and Reagents**\n\nThe reaction starts with an iminium salt, `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`, and involves the reagents LDA, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺. This set of reagents and starting material is characteristic of a Stork enamine alkylation, a multi-step synthesis used to add an alkyl group to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) of a ketone.\n\nThe process requires three distinct, sequential steps:\n*   **Step 1: Deprotonation.** A strong base is needed to remove an α-proton to create a nucleophile (an enamine).\n*   **Step 2: Alkylation.** The newly formed nucleophile attacks an electrophile (an alkyl halide).\n*   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The intermediate is treated with aqueous acid to regenerate the ketone.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nFor the reaction to be successful, the reagents must be added in a specific order.\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** First, the strong base, Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), is added in a suitable solvent like dimethoxyethane (DME) to deprotonate the iminium salt and form the nucleophilic enamine.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Second, the alkylating agent, iodoethane (ethyl iodide), is added. The enamine attacks the ethyl iodide, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and a new, larger iminium salt.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** Third, an acidic aqueous workup (H₃O⁺) is performed to hydrolyze the iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\nAny sequence that mixes these steps, for example, by adding the base (LDA) and acid (H₃O⁺) at the same time, is chemically incorrect because they would neutralize each other. Therefore, the only correct sequence is `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Starting Ketone Skeleton:** The name \"pentan-2-ylidene\" indicates the reaction starts with the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Site of Reaction:** Pentan-2-one has two α-carbons: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. LDA is a sterically bulky base, so it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as kinetic control.\n*   **Alkylation:** An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) from the iodoethane is added to the C1 position. The original `CH₃-` group at C1 becomes a `CH₃CH₂-CH₂-` (propyl) group.\n*   **Final Structure:** The resulting ketone has a propyl group on one side of the carbonyl and a propyl group on the other side: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain has seven carbons (heptane), and the carbonyl group is at position 4. The name of the product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4.
