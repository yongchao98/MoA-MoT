Its energy is $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$. Its energy is $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$. (The positron has the same rest mass, $m_e$, as the electron).\n    *   **Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies.\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Momentum**\n    The relativistic momentum $p$ is related to energy by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This can be rearranged to $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot mc^2$.\n    *   **Electron Momentum ($p_e$):** It moves from the left, so we assign its momentum a positive direction (+x).\n        $p_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2 \\implies p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n    *   **Positron Momentum ($p_p$):** It moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative direction (-x).\n        $p_p c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2 \\implies p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** This is the vector sum of the momenta.\n        $P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n\n3.  **Analyze Final State (Two Photons) and Apply Conservation Laws**\n    The initial energy and momentum are transferred to the two photons produced after annihilation.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons. Let the energy of each photon be $E_\\gamma$.\n        $E_{initial} = 2 E_\\gamma \\implies 6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$. The magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n        $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. This is consistent with the description of one photon moving \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\" at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$. The total angle between the photons will be $2\\theta$.\n        The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n        $P_{final} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    We equate the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    $P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\n    Substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$:\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6 \\cos(\\theta)$\n\n    Now, solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n    $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\n    Calculate the numerical value:\n    $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\n    Find the angle $\\theta$:\n    $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n    Angle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated angle of 138.2° is closest to the value in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system must be conserved. We first calculate the total energy of the electron and positron before they collide. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (E_e):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²` (where `m_e` is the rest mass of an electron).\n\n*   **Positron's Energy (E_p):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²` (a positron has the same rest mass as an electron).\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n`6m_e c² = 2 * E_γ`\n`E_γ = 3m_e c²`\nSo, each photon has an energy of `3m_e c²`.\n\n### 2. Principle of Conservation of Momentum\n\nMomentum, which is a vector quantity, must also be conserved. The momentum of a relativistic particle can be found using the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):**\n    *   The electron moves from the left, which we define as the positive x-direction.\n    *   `(p_e c)² = E_e² - (m_e c²)² = (4m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 15(m_e c²)²`\n    *   `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e c`.\n\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):**\n    *   The positron moves from the right, which is the negative x-direction.\n    *   `(p_p c)² = E_p² - (m_e c²)² = (2m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 3(m_e c²)²`\n    *   `p_p = -sqrt(3) * m_e c` (the negative sign indicates the direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):**\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely along the x-axis.\n    *   `P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c`.\n\nThe final momentum is carried by the two photons. For a photon, momentum `p = E/c`.\n*   **Momentum of each photon (p_γ):**\n    *   `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\nSince the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let `θ` be the angle of each photon's path relative to the horizontal axis. The total angle between them will be `2θ`.\n\n*   **Total Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    *   The horizontal component of the final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum.\n    *   `P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\nBy conservation of momentum, `P_initial_x = P_final_x`:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nWe can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nUsing the approximate values:\n*   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n*   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nNow we find the angle `θ`:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\nAngle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\nThis value is closest to the option 138.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided solutions to understand the underlying physics principles and mathematical derivations.

Understand the Physical Principles**\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of two fundamental laws of physics in the context of special relativity:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system (which is a vector quantity) must be the same before and after the collision.\n\n**2. Define the Initial State and Calculate Energy/Momentum**\nWe must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum since the particles are moving at high speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors > 1).\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** $E = \\gamma m c^2$\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} m c$\n\nLet's set the horizontal axis as the x-axis, with the electron moving in the +x direction.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Energy: $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_e = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$ (in the +x direction).\n\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_p = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} m_e c = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$ (in the -x direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   **Total Energy:** $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Total Momentum:** Momentum is a vector.

Its energy is $E_e = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$. Its energy is $E_p = 2 m_e c^2$. (The positron has the same rest mass, $m_e$, as the electron).\n    *   **Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies.\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Momentum**\n    The relativistic momentum $p$ is related to energy by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This can be rearranged to $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot mc^2$.\n    *   **Electron Momentum ($p_e$):** It moves from the left, so we assign its momentum a positive direction (+x).\n        $p_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2 \\implies p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n    *   **Positron Momentum ($p_p$):** It moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative direction (-x).\n        $p_p c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c^2 = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2 \\implies p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** This is the vector sum of the momenta.\n        $P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n\n3.  **Analyze Final State (Two Photons) and Apply Conservation Laws**\n    The initial energy and momentum are transferred to the two photons produced after annihilation.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is divided equally between the two photons. Let the energy of each photon be $E_\\gamma$.\n        $E_{initial} = 2 E_\\gamma \\implies 6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$. The magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n        $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was purely horizontal.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system must be conserved. We first calculate the total energy of the electron and positron before they collide. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (E_e):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²` (where `m_e` is the rest mass of an electron).\n\n*   **Positron's Energy (E_p):**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²` (a positron has the same rest mass as an electron).\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n`6m_e c² = 2 * E_γ`\n`E_γ = 3m_e c²`\nSo, each photon has an energy of `3m_e c²`.\n\n### 2. Principle of Conservation of Momentum\n\nMomentum, which is a vector quantity, must also be conserved. The momentum of a relativistic particle can be found using the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):**\n    *   The electron moves from the left, which we define as the positive x-direction.\n    *   `(p_e c)² = E_e² - (m_e c²)² = (4m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 15(m_e c²)²`\n    *   `p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e c`.\n\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):**\n    *   The positron moves from the right, which is the negative x-direction.\n    *   `(p_p c)² = E_p² - (m_e c²)² = (2m_e c²)² - (m_e c²)² = 3(m_e c²)²`\n    *   `p_p = -sqrt(3) * m_e c` (the negative sign indicates the direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):**\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely along the x-axis.\n    *   `P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c`.\n\nThe final momentum is carried by the two photons. For a photon, momentum `p = E/c`.\n*   **Momentum of each photon (p_γ):**\n    *   `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\nSince the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let `θ` be the angle of each photon's path relative to the horizontal axis. The total angle between them will be `2θ`.\n\n*   **Total Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    *   The horizontal component of the final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum.\n    *   `P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\nBy conservation of momentum, `P_initial_x = P_final_x`:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nWe can now solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nUsing the approximate values:\n*   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n*   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nNow we find the angle `θ`:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\nAngle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\nThis value is closest to the option 138.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that.

The final x-momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta.\n    *   `P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`.\n    *   We can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n        `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**\n    *   Using the approximate values: `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873` and `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option 138.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Principles\nThe problem involves a high-speed particle collision and annihilation, which is governed by the laws of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial State of the System\nWe need to find the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron pair before they collide.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Electron's energy (`E_e`): With `γ_e = 4`, the energy is `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Positron's energy (`E_p`): With `γ_p = 2`, the energy is `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`)**: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²`.\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum of a particle can be found using the relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which gives `p = (√(E² - (mc²)²))/c = mc√(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis.\n    *   Electron's momentum (`p_e`): `p_e = m_e * c * √(4² - 1) = m_e * c * √15`.\n    *   Positron's momentum (`p_p`): It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e * c * √(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * √3`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`)**: This is the vector sum. Since the motion is only along the x-axis, `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State of the System\nThe final state consists of two photons with equal energy.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (`E_γ`).\n    *   `E_initial = E_final` => `6 * m_e * c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum of the two photons.\n    *   The momentum of a single photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   The initial momentum was purely in the horizontal (x) direction. To conserve momentum, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since their energies (and thus momentum magnitudes) are equal, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: `P_final = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n### 4. Solve for the Angle\nBy equating the initial and final momentum:\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\nNow, we solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nUsing the approximate values `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n`Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.2 degrees. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 96\nB) 138\nC) 172\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 138. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many perform the calculation correctly, they often map the result to the wrong letter. The overwhelming consensus of the correct physical derivation points to 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the final answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of the physics problem is required.

Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem must be solved using the laws of **conservation of energy** and **conservation of momentum** from the theory of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Initial State: Energy and Momentum Calculation**\n\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of the electron and positron, and `c` be the speed of light. The horizontal axis is the x-axis.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` can be found from the energy-momentum relation `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which gives `p = (1/c) * sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = m c * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   Moves from the left (+x direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n*   Energy: `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum: `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)`.\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   Moves from the right (-x direction).\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n*   Energy: `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n*   Momentum: `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)`.\n\n**Total Initial System:**\n*   **Total Energy:** `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n*   **Total Momentum:** `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.

The problem states they have equal energy (`E_γ`).\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`.\n    The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### **4. Momentum Conservation and Angle Calculation**\n\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero. For the final momentum in the y-direction to also be zero, the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the horizontal (x) direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta.\n    `P_final = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\n*   Equating the initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\n*   Solving for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n### **5.
