The cyanide ion from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    2.  This forms a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n    3.  This intermediate must be protonated by a proton source (an acid) to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Evaluating Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid and is the standard way to represent the required proton source for this step.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` is used for a different reaction (bisulfite addition) and is not the correct reagent here.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile requires vigorous conditions, typically heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. Reagent B acts as the catalyst in the presence of water.\n*   **Evaluating Reagent B:** We must choose between the remaining options for B: `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) and `HCl` (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to catalyze this reaction efficiently.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both analyses:\n*   Reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent B is **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
