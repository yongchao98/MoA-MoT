The search results confirm the methodology for calculating the partition function for a system of spins. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Identify all possible microstates of the system. For three spins (S1, S2, S3) that can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n2.  Calculate the energy E for each microstate using the given Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n3.  Group the states by their energy level and determine the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n4.  Calculate the partition function Z by summing the term g * e^(-βE) for each energy level, where g is the degeneracy.\n\nMy calculation followed these steps precisely.\n\n*   **States with all spins parallel:**\n    *   (+, +, +): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   (-, -, -): E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n    *   These two states have an energy of -3J. The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **States with one spin flipped:**\n    *   (+, +, -): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   (+, -, +): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, +, +): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (+, -, -): E = -J(-1-1+1) = J\n    *   (-, +, -): E = -J(-1+1-1) = J\n    *   (-, -, +): E = -J(1-1-1) = J\n    *   These six states all have an energy of J. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n*   **Partition Function Z:**\n    *   Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\n    *   Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n    *   Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option B. The search results, particularly those discussing the Ising model on a triangular lattice, confirm that systems with this type of interaction (three spins interacting in a triangle) have these two energy levels. For a ferromagnetic interaction (J>0), the ground state (lowest energy) is when all spins are aligned, and the next energy level occurs when one spin is flipped. My calculation is consistent with this.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies and degeneracies.\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) - Matches my calculation.\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) - Incorrect energies.\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta) - Incorrect signs in the exponents.\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2x2x2 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT):\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nWe must evaluate the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates:\n\n1.  **All spins are up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins are down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n    These two states have the same energy, E1 = -3J. This energy level has a degeneracy (number of states) of g1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Two spins are up, and one is down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n4.  **One spin is up, and two are down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n    All six of these states (3 from case 3 and 3 from case 4) have the same energy, E2 = J. This energy level has a degeneracy of g2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo find the partition function Z of the system, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system. The system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates:\n\n**Case 1: All three spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states that have an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned.**\n*   **Two spins are +1, and one is -1.**\n    *   **State 3:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n        E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 4:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n        E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 5:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n        E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n*   **Two spins are -1, and one is +1.**\n    *   **State 6:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n        E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   **State 7:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n        E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 8:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n        E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nThere are 6 states that have an energy of J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all microstates, which can be grouped by their energy levels:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nZ = (Number of states with energy -3J) * e^(-β(-3J)) + (Number of states with energy J) * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Define the System and States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take a value of +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\nwhere E_i is the energy of the i-th state and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**3. List all Possible States and Calculate their Energies**\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list the states and their corresponding energies:\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n**4. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels for the system:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1:** E1 = -3J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned (all up or all down).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2:** E2 = J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow we can write the partition function by summing over the energy levels, taking into account their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1.

Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\n**3. Understand the Partition Function**\n\n*   The partition function (Z) is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n*   The formula is: Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to find the unique energy levels and their degeneracy (how many states have that same energy). Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice the symmetry. The energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two (two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1.

List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem. The skeptic's concerns about calculation errors are valid and highlight the need for a careful and systematic execution of the plan.

This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1.

Since each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible configurations:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states have an energy of -3J.\n\n3.  **One spin down, two spins up:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n4.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nThese six states all have an energy of J.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function Z, which is the sum over all states of e^(-βE):\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nWe have two distinct energy levels with their corresponding degeneracies (number of states with that energy):\n*   Energy E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nThe partition function is therefore:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σ_states exp(-βE).\n\nMy proposed solution path is to:\n1.  List all possible microstates of the system. Since there are 3 spins with 2 states each, there are 2^3 = 8 total microstates.\n2.  For each microstate, calculate the corresponding energy E.\n3.  Group the states by their energy values to find the degeneracy of each energy level.\n4.  Calculate the partition function by summing the term g * exp(-βE) for each unique energy level, where 'g' is the degeneracy.\n\nThis is a self-contained theoretical problem, so no external search is required. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\nSkeptic: The proposed method is correct, but it is susceptible to manual calculation errors. There are 8 states, and for each state, three products and a sum must be calculated. A single error in any of these calculations will lead to an incorrect result. For instance, confusing the signs of J or β, or miscalculating the product of spins (e.g., -1 * -1 = -1) are common pitfalls. It is critical to be systematic. Let's double-check the energy calculation for a mixed state, say (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1).\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J.\nThis seems correct. The key will be to carefully enumerate all 8 states and their energies and then correctly sum them to form the partition function.\n\nDecide: The analytical approach is the correct and only way to solve this problem. The skeptic's concerns about calculation errors are valid and highlight the need for a careful and systematic execution of the plan. I will create a table to organize the states, energies, and degeneracies to ensure accuracy.\n\n| State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | Energy (E) | Term in Z |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n| 2 | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 3 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 4 | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 5 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 6 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 7 | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| 8 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n\nFrom the table, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs for the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is 2.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs for the other 6 states. The degeneracy is 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the terms for all states:\nZ = (Number of states with E1) * e^(-βE1) + (Number of states with E2) * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * -3J) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D. The debate converges.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
