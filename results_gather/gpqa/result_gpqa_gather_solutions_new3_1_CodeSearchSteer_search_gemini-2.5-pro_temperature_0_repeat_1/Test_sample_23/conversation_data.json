This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 ≈ 0.1428, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\nThe problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or behave as such.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This means Y consists of cyclohexane and another liquid that, upon severe hydrogenation, also becomes cyclohexane.\n*   A plausible reaction that fits the description of a disproportionation producing two stable C6 molecules is the catalytic transfer of hydrogen to form a saturated ring and an aromatic ring. Let's hypothesize that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis:\n    *   **Does it decolorize bromine water?** Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene's aromatic ring is very stable and does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst, so the mixture would not decolorize it. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y:** Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C6H12) causes no change. Hydrogenating benzene (C6H6) adds 3 molecules of H2 to form cyclohexane (C6H12). Thus, hydrogenating the mixture (cyclohexane + benzene) yields only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When heated with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both components of X must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\nThe transformation from X to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X must donate hydrogen (get oxidized to benzene), and the other must accept hydrogen (get reduced to cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two liquids in mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\nThis is a balanced reaction if one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B. For this to be a hydrogen transfer:\n*   One molecule (the hydrogen acceptor) must be C6H10. When it accepts two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H12.\n*   The other molecule (the hydrogen donor) must be C6H8. When it loses two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H6.\n\nSo, the components of mixture X are a C6H10 molecule and a C6H8 molecule.\n*   **C6H10**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n*   **C6H8**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be a cyclohexadiene. The two isomers are 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The problem states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds, which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, this component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n\nThis proposed composition for mixture X fits all conditions. The reaction on heated platinum is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer, which is a form of disproportionation:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes (general formula CnH2n), as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore approximately 1/(1+6) = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. A search confirms that for cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass percent of hydrogen is 14.37%, which aligns with the given data. Z is also described as a widely used solvent, which is true for cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction of mixture X. Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). Since Z itself is a component of Y and is already saturated, the other component of Y must also be a saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is only possible if the other component is an isomer of cyclohexane that can be converted to it, which is unlikely under these conditions, or if the reaction products are cyclohexane and a compound that is stable to bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. A classic example of such a disproportionation is the catalytic reaction of unsaturated six-membered rings to form cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated. The reaction of mixture X produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). This is a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. The overall atomic balance must be maintained.\n    *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n    *   Reactants (Mixture X): X1 + X2 = C12H18\n    Since both components of X are hydrogenated to cyclohexane, they must both be C6 cyclic compounds. Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Thus, a + b = 18.\n\n4.  **Apply Constraints to Mixture X:** The components of X are unsaturated but do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadiene isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has its double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n    *   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X must be cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n\n5.  **Verify the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The proposed reaction is: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n    *   This reaction is a known catalytic disproportionation where hydrogen is transferred from one molecule to another.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon can be an alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The formula CₙH₂ₙ matches the empirical formula CH₂. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the information provided for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue: it means that all the components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other component be Y'.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y' must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield cyclohexane. The most common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is readily hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer. In such a reaction, some molecules are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen) while others are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (hydrogenated product) and benzene (dehydrogenated product) from unsaturated C₆ cyclic precursors is a classic example of this.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Based on the hydrogenation results, X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        *   Carbon: 6 + 6 = 6 + 6 (This is consistent).\n        *   Hydrogen: a + b = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ is 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so both X₁ and X₂ must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). This means a < 12 and b < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two plausible unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical combination is a C₆ alkene and a C₆ diene.\n        *   Let X₁ be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. (a=10)\n        *   Let X₂ be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). (b=8)\n    *   Check the sum: a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The cyclohexadiene must be non-conjugated, so it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   The reaction is: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). In this hydrogen transfer, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its general formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n*   Mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7.\n*   So, y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n*   7y = 12x + y\n*   6y = 12x\n*   y = 2x\n*   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's verify the mass percentage for C6H12: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the given value. So, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both C and D, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Now we need to identify C. C must be a compound that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds fit this description. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n*   So, a plausible composition for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze mixture X and the reaction.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → C + D\n*   Substituting the identified compounds: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Since the reactants (A, B) and products (C, D) are all in equimolar ratios, we can balance the atoms.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C6H6) + (C6H12) = C12H18.\n*   Therefore, the total atoms in reactants must also be C12H18. So, A + B = C12H18.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   We are looking for two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6 cyclic compounds, A and B, whose elemental formulas sum to C12H18.\n*   The most common unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is not conjugated.\n*   Let's test the combination of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Let's check the sum of their atoms: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   In this reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene acts as a hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer, a type of disproportionation.\n*   This identification of A and B fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`\n*   `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y`\n*   `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y`\n*   `1.7136x = 0.8572y`\n*   `y / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n*   This means the empirical formula is CH2, and the molecular formula is `CnH2n`.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7. For a `CnH2n` compound, the H% is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This confirms the formula type.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives only substance Z. This is a crucial clue. It means all components of both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is the skeleton of the cycloalkane Z.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. Y does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y.\n*   Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. Let Y1 = Z = `CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n*   Y2 is also in mixture Y, so it doesn't decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). Hydrogenation of Y2 gives Z (`CnH2n`). If Y2 were a different saturated isomer of Z, it wouldn't react with hydrogen. Therefore, Y2 must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n*   This points to the Zelinsky disproportionation, where unsaturated cyclic compounds are converted into a mixture of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon.\n*   Let's test possible carbon skeletons:\n    *   **C5 skeleton:** Z would be cyclopentane (C5H10). The corresponding aromatic compound would need to be C5, but there is no stable, neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbon. So, n≠5.\n    *   **C6 skeleton:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits.\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   Does Y decolorize bromine water? No. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react with bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Is Z (cyclohexane) a widely used solvent? Yes. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is unreactive. Benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   **C7 skeleton:** Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound is toluene (C7H8). This system also works by the same logic as the C6 system.\n    *   **C8 skeleton:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding unsaturated compound is cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). However, cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic and behaves as a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. This contradicts the properties of mixture Y. So, n≠8.\n\n*   The most plausible systems are the C6 and C7 systems. In the context of typical chemistry problems, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental and most common example of this type of reaction. We will proceed with the C6 system as the most likely intended answer.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated.\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X1 and X2 gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means X1 and X2 are C6 unsaturated compounds with a six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that converts an equimolar mixture X into an equimolar mixture Y. This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n*   Substituting the components of Y we found: `X1 + X2 -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is oxidized to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   `X1 (acceptor) + 2H -> C6H12`. This implies X1 has 10 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   `X2 (donor) -> C6H6 + 2H`. This implies X2 has 8 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H8. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   The problem states there are no conjugated bonds in X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For C6H8, we must choose the non-conjugated isomer, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds).\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). All conditions are met.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial Analysis & Plan**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Key Information:**\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, mass % H = 14.28%.\n    *   Hydrogenating both mixture X and mixture Y gives only Z. This means all components of X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   X -> Y is a disproportionation reaction on Pt. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions, often involving cyclic compounds (e.g., Zelinzky irreversible catalysis).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7.\n*   **Execution:**\n    ```python\n    # Let the formula of the hydrocarbon Z be CxHy.\n    # Mass fraction of H = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses: H=1, C=12.\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # y / (12*x + y) = 1/7\n    # 7y = 12x + y\n    # 6y = 12x\n    # y = 2x\n    # The general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    \n    # Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen),\n    # it must be a cycloalkane.\n    # A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n    # Let's verify the mass fraction for C6H12 (using more precise masses C=12.01, H=1.008)\n    \n    mass_H = 12 * 1.008\n    mass_C = 6 * 12.01\n    total_mass = mass_C + mass_H\n    mass_fraction_H = mass_H / total_mass\n    \n    print(f\"Formula type: C_n H_2n (cycloalkane)\")\n    print(f\"Candidate Z: Cyclohexane (C6H12)\")\n    print(f\"Calculated H mass fraction for C6H12: {mass_fraction_H:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Given H mass fraction: 0.1428\")\n    ```\n*   **Result:**\n    ```text\n    Formula type: C_n H_2n (cycloalkane)\n    Candidate Z: Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    Calculated H mass fraction for C6H12: 0.1439\n    Given H mass fraction: 0.1428\n    ```\n*   **Reasoning:** The calculated mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12) is extremely close to the given value. Cyclohexane is also a widely used solvent. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**3. Execution Step 2: Deduce Mixtures Y and X**\n\n*   **Refined Plan:** Now that Z is known to be cyclohexane, I can deduce the compositions of Y and X. The key is the disproportionation reaction X -> Y catalyzed by Platinum. This strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction between cyclic alkenes/alkadienes.\n*   **Action:** Use chemical principles to identify the components of Y and X. No calculation or search is needed for this logical step.\n*   **Execution (Logical Deduction):**\n    1.  **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, formed from disproportionation. It does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one component. The disproportionation of a C6 cyclic compound on Pt typically produces the fully saturated version (cyclohexane) and the fully unsaturated aromatic version (benzene).\n        *   Let's propose **Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**.\n        *   This mixture is equimolar.\n        *   Neither component decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Hydrogenation of this mixture (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12; C6H12 -> C6H12) yields only cyclohexane (Z). This fits all conditions for Y.\n\n    2.  **Mixture X:** X is an equimolar mixture that disproportionates to form Y = {Benzene, Cyclohexane}. The reaction must be a hydrogen transfer.\n        *   A + B -> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This is a redox reaction where A is oxidized to benzene and B is reduced to cyclohexane (or vice-versa). The total atoms must balance. The most plausible reaction involves species with intermediate hydrogenation states.\n        *   Let's try **X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), Cyclohexene (C6H10)}**.\n        *   **Reaction:** C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene is oxidized, and the monoene is reduced.\n        *   **Check conditions for X:**\n            *   *Equimolar mixture:* Yes.\n            *   *Decolorizes bromine water:* Yes, both have double bonds.\n            *   *No conjugated multiple bonds:* Yes, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds.\n            *   *Hydrogenation gives only Z:* C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12; C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12. Yes, both give cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   This set of compounds fits all the constraints of the problem.\n\n**4. Execution Step 3: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Refined Plan:** The components of X have been identified. The final step is to sum the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Action:** Sum the hydrogen atoms in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   Liquid 1 in X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Liquid 2 in X: Cyclohexene (C6H10). Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A. The plan is complete and the result is confirmed.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is calculated as (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given data.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product after hydrogenating mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Its molar mass is 84.16 g/mol, and the hydrogen mass fraction is (12.096 / 84.16) * 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the provided value.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating saturation.\n    *   One component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   A compound that does not readily decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive toward bromine water without a catalyst, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under more severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating unsaturation.\n    *   Heating mixture X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene). A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The overall reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Since the reactants (A and B) and products are equimolar, we can balance the atoms. The total atoms in the products are C12H18 (from C6H12 + C6H6). Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   As A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. We have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), so x and y must be less than 12 (the number of hydrogens in saturated cyclohexane).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   A logical pair of C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds that are separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. 1,3-cyclohexadiene, an isomer, has conjugated double bonds and is thus excluded.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   In this hydrogen transfer, the cyclohexene gains two hydrogens to become cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene. The atoms (C12H18) are balanced. This is a known catalytic disproportionation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogens in each.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (Hydrogens in C6H10) + (Hydrogens in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The percentage of hydrogen is approximately 1/7th of the total mass (100 / 7 ≈ 14.28).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   If we test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n*   This matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n*   Substance Z (Cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Cyclohexane.\n*   Let the components of Y be Cyclohexane and liquid D. Since hydrogenating D yields Cyclohexane, and D does not decolorize bromine water, D must be a substance that is resistant to bromination but can be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds like benzene fit this description. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and Benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Unravel the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B), reacts on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (Cyclohexane and Benzene). This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   In this context, disproportionation refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one reactant is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n*   The total atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Cyclohexane, which means both A and B must be unsaturated compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   For the hydrogen transfer to be possible, one reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (C₆H₆) and the other must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Let's test possible C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds. A logical choice for A and B would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Let's check if these fit: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This balances perfectly.\n*   The reaction is: **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**. In this reaction, cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This type of hydrogen transfer is a known catalytic process.\n\n**4. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which is true for both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene.\n*   A crucial constraint is that the compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has only one double bond, so it has no conjugated bonds.\n*   Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n*   Given the constraint, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   Therefore, mixture X consists of **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n\n*   The percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n    (Mass of 2n H atoms) / (Mass of n C atoms + Mass of 2n H atoms) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n*   **Mixture X** is composed of two unsaturated liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds.\n*   When heated with a platinum catalyst, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Mixture Y** does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst.\n*   **Hydrogenation** of both mixture X (unsaturated) and mixture Y under \"severe conditions\" yields only cyclohexane (Z). The severe conditions are necessary to hydrogenate the aromatic component of mixture Y.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture Y**\nSince the hydrogenation of mixture Y produces only cyclohexane (C6H12), its components must have a C6 carbon skeleton. We also know that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y. The other component must be the product of an oxidation (dehydrogenation) part of the disproportionation, which also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This substance is benzene (C6H6).\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\nThe transformation from mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction where hydrogen atoms are transferred between molecules. The overall reaction can be represented as:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane + Benzene (Mixture Y)\n\n*   Since mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction is 1:1:1:1.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total atoms in Mixture Y = (6 C + 12 H) + (6 C + 6 H) = 12 C + 18 H.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C6H12), they must both be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated. The most likely candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check the atom count: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. This rules out cyclohexa-1,3-diene, leaving **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** as the diene component. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond and thus no conjugation.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the general formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let its formula be C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is characteristic of the ratio 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is m / (12n + m).\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: m / (12n + m) = 1/7.\n*   Cross-multiplying gives 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂ and the molecular formula is C_n H_{2n}.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific cycloalkane Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y via disproportionation. This is a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). The other component does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The most plausible dehydrogenation product that is stable and does not react with bromine water is an aromatic compound. For a single-ring system, this requires a six-membered ring to form the stable aromatic compound benzene.\n*   This strongly implies that n=6.\n*   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component of Y must be the corresponding dehydrogenation product, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits the conditions for mixture Y:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Both are liquids at standard conditions.\n    *   Neither decolorizes bromine water (benzene only reacts under specific conditions, not simple mixing).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions gives only one substance, cyclohexane (Z), as required.\n*   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall disproportionation reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since both A and B are hydrogenated to give only Z (cyclohexane), they must both be compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\n*   From the balanced reaction, we can conserve the number of hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   A crucial constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   We need to find two different non-conjugated cyclic alkenes with a C₆ ring, C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ, such that x + y = 18.\n*   Let's consider the possible non-conjugated C₆ cyclic alkenes:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀):** It has one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈):** It has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   (Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds and is therefore excluded).\n*   The pair A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all conditions.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with the disproportionation products.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Mixture X consists of one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the problem is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011n + 2n * 1.008) which simplifies to approximately 2/14 or 1/7, which is ~14.3%. The problem states Z is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Mixture Y**: This mixture does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. It is formed from a disproportionation reaction and contains Z (cyclohexane) as one component. Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane. This is consistent with Y being a mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst.\n\n3.  **Mixture X**: This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. It has no conjugated multiple bonds. When heated with platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **The Disproportionation Reaction**: The overall transformation is from mixture X (composed of two molecules, X1 and X2) to mixture Y (composed of cyclohexane and benzene).\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identity of X1 and X2**: To satisfy the conditions, X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. A plausible combination for X1 and X2 would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Neither cyclohexene nor 1,4-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene does).\n    *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene can act as a hydrogen donor. Such reactions involving cyclohexene, cyclohexadienes, cyclohexane, and benzene with platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n\nThe central point is the conservation of atoms in the reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAnswering based on the verified reasoning:\n\nThe problem is solved by systematically identifying the chemical species involved.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z:** The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) in a saturated hydrocarbon implies a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. Given that Z is a common solvent, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (cyclohexane). The other liquid in Y also hydrogenates to Z, meaning it has a C₆ skeleton. Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, this second liquid must be saturated or aromatic. As it's not cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Mixture X:** Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   Reaction: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous output is correct.

The problem states that the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. I can use this information to determine the empirical and likely molecular formula of Z. Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon, which means it's either an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n*   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 gives (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 0.1428, which does not yield an integer solution for n.\n*   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is a match for 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. This suggests Z is likely a common cycloalkane solvent. I will perform a search to confirm this and identify Z.\n\n**Proposer**: The calculation confirms that Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n). Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula. The core of the problem is the disproportionation reaction. Mixture X (two unsaturated liquids, A and B) is heated with platinum to form mixture Y (two saturated liquids, C and D). This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer, specifically the Zelin-Kazansky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into an aromatic compound and a cycloalkane.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring, meaning Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   **Mixture X** must contain unsaturated C6 compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. They cannot have conjugated bonds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **The Reaction**: A hydrogen transfer reaction between these two would be:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n*   **Mixture Y** would therefore be cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   **Skeptic**: Let's check if this hypothesis fits all the conditions.\n    1.  *Is X an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water?* Yes, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are liquids and have double bonds. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture.\n    2.  *Is Y an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does NOT decolorize bromine water?* The reaction produces cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio. Neither cyclohexane (saturated) nor benzene (aromatic) decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    3.  *Does hydrogenation of X give only Z?* Hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) also gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, yes, Z is cyclohexane.\n    4.  *Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?* Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions (needed for benzene) gives only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    5.  *Is Z a constituent of Y?* Yes, cyclohexane (Z) is a component of mixture Y.\n    6.  *Is Z a widely used solvent?* Yes, cyclohexane is a common solvent.\n\n**Proposer**: The hypothesis holds up against all the facts. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n**Skeptic**: The logic is sound. The identification of Z as a cycloalkane, the application of the Zelin-Kazansky disproportionation, and the verification against all constraints lead to a consistent solution. No other simple combination of common unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons fits the equimolar and reaction constraints as well as this one. The conclusion is well-supported.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The components of mixture X have been identified, and the total number of hydrogen atoms can be calculated.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, as the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. The problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a widely used solvent. This information strongly points to Z being **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. The fact that all components of mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to Z confirms that all molecules involved have a six-carbon skeleton.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane under severe conditions, but it must not react with bromine water. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene's aromatic stability prevents it from reacting with bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction is:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:** The key to solving this problem is the law of conservation of atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture X and produces an equimolar mixture Y, we can balance the atoms for one molecule of each component.\n\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products (Mixture Y) = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 (from C₆H₁₂) + 6 (from C₆H₆) = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Verify the Components of Mixture X (Optional but Confirmatory):** The components of X must be two different C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that, when added together, have 18 hydrogen atoms. They must also be non-conjugated. The pair that fits is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   They are both unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is not conjugated (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the calculation from the conservation of atoms.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 ≈ 0.1428, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\nThe problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or behave as such.\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   This means Y consists of cyclohexane and another liquid that, upon severe hydrogenation, also becomes cyclohexane.\n*   A plausible reaction that fits the description of a disproportionation producing two stable C6 molecules is the catalytic transfer of hydrogen to form a saturated ring and an aromatic ring. Let's hypothesize that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis:\n    *   **Does it decolorize bromine water?** Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene's aromatic ring is very stable and does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst, so the mixture would not decolorize it. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y:** Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C6H12) causes no change. Hydrogenating benzene (C6H6) adds 3 molecules of H2 to form cyclohexane (C6H12). Thus, hydrogenating the mixture (cyclohexane + benzene) yields only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When heated with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both components of X must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\nThe transformation from X to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X must donate hydrogen (get oxidized to benzene), and the other must accept hydrogen (get reduced to cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two liquids in mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\nThis is a balanced reaction if one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B. For this to be a hydrogen transfer:\n*   One molecule (the hydrogen acceptor) must be C6H10. When it accepts two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H12.\n*   The other molecule (the hydrogen donor) must be C6H8. When it loses two hydrogen atoms, it becomes C6H6.\n\nSo, the components of mixture X are a C6H10 molecule and a C6H8 molecule.\n*   **C6H10**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n*   **C6H8**: To hydrogenate to cyclohexane, this must be a cyclohexadiene. The two isomers are 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The problem states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds, which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, this component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, is a liquid, and decolorizes bromine water.\n\nThis proposed composition for mixture X fits all conditions. The reaction on heated platinum is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer, which is a form of disproportionation:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes (general formula CnH2n), as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore approximately 1/(1+6) = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. A search confirms that for cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass percent of hydrogen is 14.37%, which aligns with the given data. Z is also described as a widely used solvent, which is true for cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction of mixture X. Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). Since Z itself is a component of Y and is already saturated, the other component of Y must also be a saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is only possible if the other component is an isomer of cyclohexane that can be converted to it, which is unlikely under these conditions, or if the reaction products are cyclohexane and a compound that is stable to bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. A classic example of such a disproportionation is the catalytic reaction of unsaturated six-membered rings to form cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated. The reaction of mixture X produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). This is a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. The overall atomic balance must be maintained.\n    *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n    *   Reactants (Mixture X): X1 + X2 = C12H18\n    Since both components of X are hydrogenated to cyclohexane, they must both be C6 cyclic compounds. Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Thus, a + b = 18.\n\n4.  **Apply Constraints to Mixture X:** The components of X are unsaturated but do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadiene isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has its double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n    *   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X must be cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n\n5.  **Verify the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The proposed reaction is: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n    *   This reaction is a known catalytic disproportionation where hydrogen is transferred from one molecule to another.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon can be an alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The formula CₙH₂ₙ matches the empirical formula CH₂. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the information provided for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue: it means that all the components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other component be Y'.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y' must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield cyclohexane. The most common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is readily hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer. In such a reaction, some molecules are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen) while others are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (hydrogenated product) and benzene (dehydrogenated product) from unsaturated C₆ cyclic precursors is a classic example of this.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Based on the hydrogenation results, X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        *   Carbon: 6 + 6 = 6 + 6 (This is consistent).\n        *   Hydrogen: a + b = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ is 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so both X₁ and X₂ must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). This means a < 12 and b < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two plausible unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical combination is a C₆ alkene and a C₆ diene.\n        *   Let X₁ be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. (a=10)\n        *   Let X₂ be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). (b=8)\n    *   Check the sum: a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The cyclohexadiene must be non-conjugated, so it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   The reaction is: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). In this hydrogen transfer, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its general formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n*   Mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7.\n*   So, y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n*   7y = 12x + y\n*   6y = 12x\n*   y = 2x\n*   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's verify the mass percentage for C6H12: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the given value. So, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both C and D, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Now we need to identify C. C must be a compound that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds fit this description. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n*   So, a plausible composition for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze mixture X and the reaction.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → C + D\n*   Substituting the identified compounds: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Since the reactants (A, B) and products (C, D) are all in equimolar ratios, we can balance the atoms.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C6H6) + (C6H12) = C12H18.\n*   Therefore, the total atoms in reactants must also be C12H18. So, A + B = C12H18.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   We are looking for two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6 cyclic compounds, A and B, whose elemental formulas sum to C12H18.\n*   The most common unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is not conjugated.\n*   Let's test the combination of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Let's check the sum of their atoms: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   In this reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene acts as a hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer, a type of disproportionation.\n*   This identification of A and B fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`\n*   `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y`\n*   `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y`\n*   `1.7136x = 0.8572y`\n*   `y / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n*   This means the empirical formula is CH2, and the molecular formula is `CnH2n`.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The value 14.28% is exactly 1/7. For a `CnH2n` compound, the H% is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This confirms the formula type.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives only substance Z. This is a crucial clue. It means all components of both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is the skeleton of the cycloalkane Z.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. Y does not decolorize bromine water. Z is a component of Y.\n*   Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. Let Y1 = Z = `CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n*   Y2 is also in mixture Y, so it doesn't decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). Hydrogenation of Y2 gives Z (`CnH2n`). If Y2 were a different saturated isomer of Z, it wouldn't react with hydrogen. Therefore, Y2 must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to Z. The most logical candidate is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n*   This points to the Zelinsky disproportionation, where unsaturated cyclic compounds are converted into a mixture of a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon.\n*   Let's test possible carbon skeletons:\n    *   **C5 skeleton:** Z would be cyclopentane (C5H10). The corresponding aromatic compound would need to be C5, but there is no stable, neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbon. So, n≠5.\n    *   **C6 skeleton:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits.\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   Does Y decolorize bromine water? No. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react with bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Is Z (cyclohexane) a widely used solvent? Yes. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is unreactive. Benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   **C7 skeleton:** Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound is toluene (C7H8). This system also works by the same logic as the C6 system.\n    *   **C8 skeleton:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding unsaturated compound is cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). However, cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic and behaves as a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. This contradicts the properties of mixture Y. So, n≠8.\n\n*   The most plausible systems are the C6 and C7 systems. In the context of typical chemistry problems, the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the fundamental and most common example of this type of reaction. We will proceed with the C6 system as the most likely intended answer.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated.\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X1 and X2 gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means X1 and X2 are C6 unsaturated compounds with a six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that converts an equimolar mixture X into an equimolar mixture Y. This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n*   Substituting the components of Y we found: `X1 + X2 -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is oxidized to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   `X1 (acceptor) + 2H -> C6H12`. This implies X1 has 10 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   `X2 (donor) -> C6H6 + 2H`. This implies X2 has 8 hydrogens, so its formula is C6H8. This is a **cyclohexadiene**.\n*   The problem states there are no conjugated bonds in X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For C6H8, we must choose the non-conjugated isomer, which is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds).\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). All conditions are met.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial Analysis & Plan**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   **Key Information:**\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, mass % H = 14.28%.\n    *   Hydrogenating both mixture X and mixture Y gives only Z. This means all components of X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   X -> Y is a disproportionation reaction on Pt. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions, often involving cyclic compounds (e.g., Zelinzky irreversible catalysis).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Z is one component of Y.\n    *   X *does* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Determine the molecular formula of Z from its hydrogen mass percentage.\n    2.  Identify Z based on its formula and properties (saturated, solvent).\n    3.  Deduce the components of Y and X by working backward from Z, using the reaction information (disproportionation, hydrogenation).\n    4.  Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the components of X.\n\n**2. Execution Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the molecular formula for Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7.\n*   **Execution:**\n    ```python\n    # Let the formula of the hydrocarbon Z be CxHy.\n    # Mass fraction of H = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses: H=1, C=12.\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # y / (12*x + y) = 1/7\n    # 7y = 12x + y\n    # 6y = 12x\n    # y = 2x\n    # The general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    \n    # Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (does not react further with hydrogen),\n    # it must be a cycloalkane.\n    # A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n    # Let's verify the mass fraction for C6H12 (using more precise masses C=12.01, H=1.008)\n    \n    mass_H = 12 * 1.008\n    mass_C = 6 * 12.01\n    total_mass = mass_C + mass_H\n    mass_fraction_H = mass_H / total_mass\n    \n    print(f\"Formula type: C_n H_2n (cycloalkane)\")\n    print(f\"Candidate Z: Cyclohexane (C6H12)\")\n    print(f\"Calculated H mass fraction for C6H12: {mass_fraction_H:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Given H mass fraction: 0.1428\")\n    ```\n*   **Result:**\n    ```text\n    Formula type: C_n H_2n (cycloalkane)\n    Candidate Z: Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    Calculated H mass fraction for C6H12: 0.1439\n    Given H mass fraction: 0.1428\n    ```\n*   **Reasoning:** The calculated mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12) is extremely close to the given value. Cyclohexane is also a widely used solvent. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**3. Execution Step 2: Deduce Mixtures Y and X**\n\n*   **Refined Plan:** Now that Z is known to be cyclohexane, I can deduce the compositions of Y and X. The key is the disproportionation reaction X -> Y catalyzed by Platinum. This strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction between cyclic alkenes/alkadienes.\n*   **Action:** Use chemical principles to identify the components of Y and X. No calculation or search is needed for this logical step.\n*   **Execution (Logical Deduction):**\n    1.  **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, formed from disproportionation. It does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one component. The disproportionation of a C6 cyclic compound on Pt typically produces the fully saturated version (cyclohexane) and the fully unsaturated aromatic version (benzene).\n        *   Let's propose **Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}**.\n        *   This mixture is equimolar.\n        *   Neither component decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Hydrogenation of this mixture (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12; C6H12 -> C6H12) yields only cyclohexane (Z). This fits all conditions for Y.\n\n    2.  **Mixture X:** X is an equimolar mixture that disproportionates to form Y = {Benzene, Cyclohexane}. The reaction must be a hydrogen transfer.\n        *   A + B -> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This is a redox reaction where A is oxidized to benzene and B is reduced to cyclohexane (or vice-versa). The total atoms must balance. The most plausible reaction involves species with intermediate hydrogenation states.\n        *   Let's try **X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), Cyclohexene (C6H10)}**.\n        *   **Reaction:** C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The diene is oxidized, and the monoene is reduced.\n        *   **Check conditions for X:**\n            *   *Equimolar mixture:* Yes.\n            *   *Decolorizes bromine water:* Yes, both have double bonds.\n            *   *No conjugated multiple bonds:* Yes, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds.\n            *   *Hydrogenation gives only Z:* C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12; C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12. Yes, both give cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   This set of compounds fits all the constraints of the problem.\n\n**4. Execution Step 3: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Refined Plan:** The components of X have been identified. The final step is to sum the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Action:** Sum the hydrogen atoms in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   Liquid 1 in X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Liquid 2 in X: Cyclohexene (C6H10). Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A. The plan is complete and the result is confirmed.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is calculated as (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given data.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product after hydrogenating mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Its molar mass is 84.16 g/mol, and the hydrogen mass fraction is (12.096 / 84.16) * 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the provided value.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating saturation.\n    *   One component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   A compound that does not readily decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive toward bromine water without a catalyst, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under more severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating unsaturation.\n    *   Heating mixture X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene). A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The overall reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Since the reactants (A and B) and products are equimolar, we can balance the atoms. The total atoms in the products are C12H18 (from C6H12 + C6H6). Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   As A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. We have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), so x and y must be less than 12 (the number of hydrogens in saturated cyclohexane).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   A logical pair of C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds that are separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. 1,3-cyclohexadiene, an isomer, has conjugated double bonds and is thus excluded.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   In this hydrogen transfer, the cyclohexene gains two hydrogens to become cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene. The atoms (C12H18) are balanced. This is a known catalytic disproportionation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogens in each.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (Hydrogens in C6H10) + (Hydrogens in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The percentage of hydrogen is approximately 1/7th of the total mass (100 / 7 ≈ 14.28).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   If we test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n*   This matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a common cycloalkane solvent.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n*   Substance Z (Cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Cyclohexane.\n*   Let the components of Y be Cyclohexane and liquid D. Since hydrogenating D yields Cyclohexane, and D does not decolorize bromine water, D must be a substance that is resistant to bromination but can be hydrogenated to Cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds like benzene fit this description. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and Benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Unravel the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B), reacts on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (Cyclohexane and Benzene). This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   In this context, disproportionation refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one reactant is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (A and B) and produces an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n*   The total atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ = C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Cyclohexane, which means both A and B must be unsaturated compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   For the hydrogen transfer to be possible, one reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (C₆H₆) and the other must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Let's test possible C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds. A logical choice for A and B would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Let's check if these fit: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ = C₁₂H₁₈. This balances perfectly.\n*   The reaction is: **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**. In this reaction, cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This type of hydrogen transfer is a known catalytic process.\n\n**4. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which is true for both cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene.\n*   A crucial constraint is that the compounds in mixture X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has only one double bond, so it has no conjugated bonds.\n*   Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n*   Given the constraint, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   Therefore, mixture X consists of **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n\n*   The percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n    (Mass of 2n H atoms) / (Mass of n C atoms + Mass of 2n H atoms) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n*   **Mixture X** is composed of two unsaturated liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of C=C double bonds.\n*   When heated with a platinum catalyst, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y.\n*   **Mixture Y** does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst.\n*   **Hydrogenation** of both mixture X (unsaturated) and mixture Y under \"severe conditions\" yields only cyclohexane (Z). The severe conditions are necessary to hydrogenate the aromatic component of mixture Y.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture Y**\nSince the hydrogenation of mixture Y produces only cyclohexane (C6H12), its components must have a C6 carbon skeleton. We also know that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y. The other component must be the product of an oxidation (dehydrogenation) part of the disproportionation, which also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This substance is benzene (C6H6).\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\nThe transformation from mixture X to mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction where hydrogen atoms are transferred between molecules. The overall reaction can be represented as:\nLiquid A + Liquid B (Mixture X) → Cyclohexane + Benzene (Mixture Y)\n\n*   Since mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction is 1:1:1:1.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total atoms in Mixture Y = (6 C + 12 H) + (6 C + 6 H) = 12 C + 18 H.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since both components of X hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C6H12), they must both be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated. The most likely candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check the atom count: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. This rules out cyclohexa-1,3-diene, leaving **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** as the diene component. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond and thus no conjugation.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the general formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let its formula be C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is characteristic of the ratio 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is m / (12n + m).\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: m / (12n + m) = 1/7.\n*   Cross-multiplying gives 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n.\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂ and the molecular formula is C_n H_{2n}.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific cycloalkane Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y via disproportionation. This is a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). The other component does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The most plausible dehydrogenation product that is stable and does not react with bromine water is an aromatic compound. For a single-ring system, this requires a six-membered ring to form the stable aromatic compound benzene.\n*   This strongly implies that n=6.\n*   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component of Y must be the corresponding dehydrogenation product, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Let's check if this pair fits the conditions for mixture Y:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Both are liquids at standard conditions.\n    *   Neither decolorizes bromine water (benzene only reacts under specific conditions, not simple mixing).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions gives only one substance, cyclohexane (Z), as required.\n*   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   The overall disproportionation reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n*   Since both A and B are hydrogenated to give only Z (cyclohexane), they must both be compounds with a six-carbon ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ.\n*   From the balanced reaction, we can conserve the number of hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which means both A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   A crucial constraint is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   We need to find two different non-conjugated cyclic alkenes with a C₆ ring, C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ, such that x + y = 18.\n*   Let's consider the possible non-conjugated C₆ cyclic alkenes:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀):** It has one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈):** It has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   (Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds and is therefore excluded).\n*   The pair A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all conditions.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with the disproportionation products.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Mixture X consists of one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the problem is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011n + 2n * 1.008) which simplifies to approximately 2/14 or 1/7, which is ~14.3%. The problem states Z is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Mixture Y**: This mixture does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. It is formed from a disproportionation reaction and contains Z (cyclohexane) as one component. Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane. This is consistent with Y being a mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst.\n\n3.  **Mixture X**: This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. It has no conjugated multiple bonds. When heated with platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **The Disproportionation Reaction**: The overall transformation is from mixture X (composed of two molecules, X1 and X2) to mixture Y (composed of cyclohexane and benzene).\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identity of X1 and X2**: To satisfy the conditions, X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. A plausible combination for X1 and X2 would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Neither cyclohexene nor 1,4-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene does).\n    *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene can act as a hydrogen donor. Such reactions involving cyclohexene, cyclohexadienes, cyclohexane, and benzene with platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n\nThe central point is the conservation of atoms in the reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAnswering based on the verified reasoning:\n\nThe problem is solved by systematically identifying the chemical species involved.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z:** The mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28% ≈ 1/7) in a saturated hydrocarbon implies a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. Given that Z is a common solvent, it is identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One is Z (cyclohexane). The other liquid in Y also hydrogenates to Z, meaning it has a C₆ skeleton. Since mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, this second liquid must be saturated or aromatic. As it's not cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Therefore, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Mixture X:** Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   Reaction: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous output is correct. The final step is to provide the answer in the requested format.\n\nThe deterministic verification confirmed the following:\n1.  Hydrocarbon Z is Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n2.  Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Benzene (C6H6) and Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to Cyclohexane. The total atom count must match that of mixture Y (C12H18). The only pair that fits all criteria (non-conjugated, decolorizes bromine water, correct atom count) is Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n-   Hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10): 10\n-   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): 8\n-   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: The first step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z. The problem states that the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. I can use this information to determine the empirical and likely molecular formula of Z. Z is also described as a saturated hydrocarbon, which means it's either an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n*   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 gives (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 0.1428, which does not yield an integer solution for n.\n*   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is a match for 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. This suggests Z is likely a common cycloalkane solvent. I will perform a search to confirm this and identify Z.\n\n**Proposer**: The calculation confirms that Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n). Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula. The core of the problem is the disproportionation reaction. Mixture X (two unsaturated liquids, A and B) is heated with platinum to form mixture Y (two saturated liquids, C and D). This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer, specifically the Zelin-Kazansky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into an aromatic compound and a cycloalkane.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring, meaning Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   **Mixture X** must contain unsaturated C6 compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. They cannot have conjugated bonds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **The Reaction**: A hydrogen transfer reaction between these two would be:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n*   **Mixture Y** would therefore be cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   **Skeptic**: Let's check if this hypothesis fits all the conditions.\n    1.  *Is X an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water?* Yes, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are liquids and have double bonds. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture.\n    2.  *Is Y an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does NOT decolorize bromine water?* The reaction produces cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio. Neither cyclohexane (saturated) nor benzene (aromatic) decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    3.  *Does hydrogenation of X give only Z?* Hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) also gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, yes, Z is cyclohexane.\n    4.  *Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?* Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane + benzene) under severe conditions (needed for benzene) gives only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    5.  *Is Z a constituent of Y?* Yes, cyclohexane (Z) is a component of mixture Y.\n    6.  *Is Z a widely used solvent?* Yes, cyclohexane is a common solvent.\n\n**Proposer**: The hypothesis holds up against all the facts. The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n**Skeptic**: The logic is sound. The identification of Z as a cycloalkane, the application of the Zelin-Kazansky disproportionation, and the verification against all constraints lead to a consistent solution. No other simple combination of common unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons fits the equimolar and reaction constraints as well as this one. The conclusion is well-supported.\n\n**Decision**: The debate converges. The components of mixture X have been identified, and the total number of hydrogen atoms can be calculated.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
