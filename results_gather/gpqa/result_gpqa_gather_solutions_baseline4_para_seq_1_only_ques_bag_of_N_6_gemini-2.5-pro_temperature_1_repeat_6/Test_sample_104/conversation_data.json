One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same periodic dimming of a star's light as a large, cool starspot region does. This means we need to calculate the brightness drop caused by the starspots and equate it to the brightness drop caused by a transiting planet.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or more accurately, the flux, F) emitted by a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that `F = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. The total flux is proportional to `T⁴`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted, hotter hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible surface has a temperature `T_eff = 6000 K`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is a mix of two temperatures:\n    *   The normal stellar surface temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   The cooler spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere (filling factor `f_spot = 0.20`). This means 80% (`1 - f_spot`) of the surface is at `T_eff` and 20% (`f_spot`) is at `T_spot`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum states.\n\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n\n    Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**3. Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a circular area of light. The drop in brightness, called the transit depth (δ), is the ratio of the planet's area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's area (`A_star = π * R_star²`).\n\n    Transit Depth (δ) = A_pl / A_star\n    δ = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    δ = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the starspot amplitude.\n\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `f_spot = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225] )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe user wants me to solve an astrophysics problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the problem:**\n*   Star's radius = Sun's radius (This is extra information, as we need a relative radius `R_pl/R_star`).\n*   One hemisphere is covered in spots.\n*   Spot filling factor `f = 20% = 0.2`.\n*   Star's effective temperature `T_eff` or `T_star` = 6000 K.\n*   Spot temperature difference = 1000 K. So, `T_spot = T_star - 1000 = 5000 K`.\n*   The goal is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical planet (`R_pl/R_star`) that would produce the same brightness dip as the spots.\n\n**2. Formulate the physics:**\n*   The brightness (flux) of a star is proportional to its effective temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`F = σT⁴`).\n*   The total flux from a visible stellar disk is the sum of fluxes from its different parts.\n*   A planet transiting a star causes a dip in brightness equal to the ratio of their projected areas: `Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n*   The rotational modulation causes a variation in brightness. We need to find the maximum amplitude of this variation.\n\n**3. Calculate the brightness variation due to spots:**\n*   **Maximum brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_star`. The flux is proportional to the area of the disk (let's call it `A_disk`) times the flux per unit area.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * σ * T_star⁴`. For simplicity, let's normalize the projected area `A_disk` to 1 and ignore the constant `σ`.\n    `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. On this hemisphere, 20% of the area is covered by spots (`f = 0.2`) and 80% is the normal photosphere (`1-f = 0.8`).\n    The flux from this side is a weighted average of the flux from the unspotted and spotted areas.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the signal:** The amplitude of the light curve variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n**4. Equate the spot signal to the planet signal:**\n*   The problem states that the amplitude from the spots should be equal to the dip caused by a planet.\n    `Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n**5. Plug in the numbers and solve:**\n*   `T_star = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n*   `f = 0.2`\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.2 * (671 / 1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is very close to 0.32.\n\nLet's double check with the previous reasoning path which was `Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`.\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_star)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * (5000/6000)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 * (5/6)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225...`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.8 + 0.09645...`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.89645...`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 0.89645... = 0.10355...`\nThis is the same result. The math is consistent.\n\nSo, `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355...`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355...) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis matches the result from the Python code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative radius is ~0.32. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spotted hemisphere is determined by the difference in flux between the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere. The flux (F) is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power (F ∝ T⁴) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n1.  **Flux from the unspotted hemisphere (Maximum Flux, F_max):**\n    This is proportional to the star's normal effective temperature.\n    `F_max ∝ T_star⁴` where `T_star = 6000 K`.\n\n2.  **Flux from the spotted hemisphere (Minimum Flux, F_min):**\n    This hemisphere has 20% (filling factor f = 0.2) of its area covered by cooler spots and the remaining 80% (1 - f) at the normal stellar temperature.\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the relative amplitude of the signal from spots:**\n    The relative change in brightness is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n    `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355`\n\n4.  **Calculate the signal from a transiting exoplanet:**\n    The drop in brightness during a transit is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n5.  **Equate the two amplitudes and solve for R_pl / R_star:**\n    The problem requires the two amplitudes to be the same.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots`\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32, which matches option C.

Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would block the same amount of light as the dimming caused by starspots on a rotating star. We need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots and then equate it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n**2. Model the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) emitted by a star is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible surface is at the star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K. So, we can write `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's surface is a mix of normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   Temperature of spots: T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   Filling factor of spots (f): 20% or 0.20.

Model the Brightness Drop due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star (a transit), it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of light blocked, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n*   Assuming both are circular disks:\n    Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    where R_pl is the planet's radius and R_star is the star's radius.\n\n**4. Equate the Two Effects and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size (R_pl / R_star) that produces the *same amplitude signal*. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot amplitude.\n\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n*   Now, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n    R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )\n\n**5.

We observe a maximum brightness when the unspotted hemisphere faces us and a minimum brightness when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The amplitude of this variation is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\nThe flux (F) emitted per unit area of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ T^4`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when we see the unspotted hemisphere.

The flux (brightness per unit area) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (L_max):** Proportional to the flux from the unspotted photosphere.\n    L_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n*   **Minimum Flux (L_min):** A combination of the flux from the unspotted part (80% of the hemisphere) and the spotted part (20% of the hemisphere).\n    L_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴\n    Where `f_spot` is the spot filling factor (0.20), `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature (6000 K), and `T_spot` is the spot temperature (5000 K).\n\nThe relative amplitude of the variation is:\nAmplitude = (L_max - L_min) / L_max\nAmplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = [f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**Step 2: Relate the amplitude to the exoplanet transit depth.**\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, δ) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nδ = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**Step 3: Equate the two effects and solve for the relative planet radius.**\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude to find the equivalent planet size.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop as a star's rotational modulation due to a large spotted region. This means we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness change from two different physical scenarios and set them equal.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Rotational Modulation due to Spots.** The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing us either a \"clean\" hemisphere or a \"spotted\" one. The difference between the maximum brightness (clean side) and minimum brightness (spotted side) defines the amplitude of this signal.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** An exoplanet passing in front of its star blocks a fraction of the star's light. The amount of dimming (the transit depth) is determined by the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size.\n\n**2. Formulate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nWe use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature difference of spots, `ΔT = 1000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f = 20% = 0.20`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's temperature to the fourth power. Let's consider a unit projected area, so `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` of this hemisphere has a temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` has the normal temperature `T_eff`. The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation (`Amplitude_spots`):** The amplitude is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**3. Formulate the Brightness Variation from a Planet Transit**\n\nDuring a transit, the planet blocks a portion of the star's disk. The depth of the transit (the amplitude of the brightness drop) is simply the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star.\n\n*   Area of the planet's disk = `π * R_pl²`\n*   Area of the star's disk = `π * R_star²`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation (`Amplitude_planet`):**\n    `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe plug the given numerical values into the final equation. This calculation was performed using the Python script.\n\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe code output confirms this result precisely.\n\n**6.

This hemisphere's surface is a composite:\n    *   A fraction `(1 - f_spot) = 0.80` radiates at `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   A fraction `f_spot = 0.20` radiates at `T_spot = 5000 K`.\n\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the two components. The relative flux is:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum, calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225...)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51774...`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the equivalent exoplanet size.**\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe flux (brightness) emitted per unit area of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F_area = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the effective temperature.\n\nThe total flux from a stellar disk is the integral of the flux over the visible area. For this problem, we can simplify this by considering the relative flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us versus when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nLet `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. We can normalize the star's flux to 1 in this state.\n`F_max = 1`\n\nLet `F_min` be the flux when the hemisphere with spots faces us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot = 0.20` of its area covered by cooler spots. The rest of the area, `1 - f_spot = 0.80`, is at the normal effective temperature.\n\n*   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n\nThe flux `F_min` is a combination of the flux from the hot part and the cool part. The total flux from a region is proportional to `Area * T⁴`.\nSo, the flux from the spotted hemisphere is proportional to:\n`(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe relative flux drop, which is the amplitude of the signal, is `ΔF / F_max`:\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nTo calculate this, we compare the flux of a completely unspotted disk to a disk that is partially covered by spots.\n`ΔF = [Area_total * T_eff⁴] - [(Area_hot * T_eff⁴) + (Area_spot * T_spot⁴)]`\nSince `Area_total = Area_hot + Area_spot`, this simplifies to:\n`ΔF = Area_spot * T_eff⁴ - Area_spot * T_spot⁴ = Area_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n\nThe fractional drop is `ΔF` relative to the flux of the unspotted area it replaces. The total flux of the star is `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴`. The flux drop is due to an area `f_spot * A_star` being cooler. So, the relative amplitude is:\n`Amplitude_spot = (f_spot * A_star * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)) / (A_star * T_eff⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (0.51775) ≈ 0.10355`\n\n### 2. Brightness Drop from Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Area of the planet, `A_pl = π * R_pl²`\n*   Area of the star, `A_star = π * R_star²`\n\nThe amplitude of the transit signal is:\n`Amplitude_transit = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 3. Equating the Amplitudes\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same* amplitude signal.\n`Amplitude_transit = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe amplitude of the flux variation due to the spots is given by the formula:\nAmplitude = `f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nThe depth of a planetary transit is given by:\nTransit Depth = `(R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe are asked to find the relative planet radius (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = `f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation:\n*   `f_spot` = 0.20 (20% filling factor)\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * 0.51775\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we take the square root to find `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star` = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThe Python code executed this calculation and returned the value `0.32`, which matches our manual calculation.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe problem requires us to equate the drop in brightness caused by stellar spots with the drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n**1.

The flux is proportional to the full star's temperature: `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the observer sees the spotted hemisphere. The total flux is a weighted sum of the flux from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts. The filling factor `f` tells us that 20% of the area has temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) has temperature `T_star`.\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n    *   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional change in flux, which is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1-f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n        *   Simplifying the numerator: `T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴ = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = (f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)) / T_star⁴`\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n3.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Dimming:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.

Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the relative change in flux as the star rotates.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. We can normalize its flux to 1, with a corresponding temperature of `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's flux is a combination of the hot, unspotted part and the cooler, spotted part.\n    *   Area of spots = 20% or `f_spot = 0.20`\n    *   Area of the hot photosphere = 80% or `1 - f_spot = 0.80`\n    *   Temperature of spots `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nThe total relative flux from the spotted face is the weighted average of the flux from its parts, compared to the unspotted face:\n\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_eff / T_eff)⁴ + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = (0.80) + (0.20) * (5000 / 6000)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.80 + 0.20 * (5/6)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.20 * (0.48225)`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.09645 = 0.89645`\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the brightness of the star drops by about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This transit depth must be equal to the amplitude calculated above.\n\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude:\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of this value:\n\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nA hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of about 0.32 times the radius of its star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation caused by the described starspots. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\n\nThe core task is to equate the dimming effect of a rotating star with spots to the dimming effect of a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the size of the exoplanet (relative to its star) that would produce the same signal amplitude.\n\n### 2. Model the Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe total energy radiated by a star (its luminosity, L) is related to its radius (R) and its effective temperature (T_eff) via the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy per unit area) is F = σT⁴. The total flux we receive is proportional to the projected area of the star (A = πR²) multiplied by the average flux from that area.\n\nLet's define the two brightness states of the star as seen from Earth:\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`. The flux received is proportional to `A_star * T_eff⁴`, where `A_star` is the area of the star's disk.\n    `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The visible disk is a composite of the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of this hemisphere covered by spots (filling factor) is `f = 0.20`.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part of the visible disk.\n        *   Flux from unspotted part: `(1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴`\n        *   Flux from spotted part: `f * A_star * T_spot⁴`\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴ + f * A_star * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe **amplitude of the signal** due to spots is the relative change in flux: `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (A_star * T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴ + f * A_star * T_spot⁴]) / (A_star * T_eff⁴)`\n\nWe can cancel out the `A_star` term:\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_eff⁴ - (1 - f)T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n### 3. Model the Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit (the \"transit depth\") is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is simply the ratio of the planet's disk area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's disk area (`A_star = π * R_star²`), assuming a central transit.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius\n\nThe problem states that the signal amplitudes are the same:\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nTo find the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`, we take the square root of both sides:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.32`.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value `~0.32` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem asks us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would produce the same dip in brightness as a star with one hemisphere covered 20% by dark spots.\n\n**1. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) emitted by a star's surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `F ∝ T⁴`.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk emits at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    `F_{max} ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. On this side, a fraction `f = 0.2` (or 20%) of the surface is covered by spots, and the remaining `1 - f = 0.8` is the normal photosphere.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux is a weighted average of the flux from the normal photosphere and the spots.\n        `F_{min} ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_{max} - F_{min}) / F_{max}`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the spots cause a brightness dip of about 10.36%.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting drop in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²)`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n**3. Equate the two Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius**\n\nWe need the amplitude from the planet transit to equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude_spots`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355`\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result means the hypothetical planet would need a radius of about 32.18% of the star's radius to produce the same signal.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from Starspots:** The brightness drop is caused by replacing a part of the star's hot surface with a cooler, spotted region. The energy radiated (flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Let the star's normal flux be proportional to T_star⁴.\n    *   Let the flux from the spots be proportional to T_spot⁴.\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) is 6000 K.\n    *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature (T_spot) is 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere is in view, 20% (or a fraction of 0.20) of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n\n    The fractional drop in flux (the amplitude of the signal) is calculated as:\n    Amplitude_spots = (Flux_unspotted - Flux_spotted) / Flux_unspotted\n    This simplifies to:\n    Amplitude_spots = filling_factor * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n    Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.1035\n\n2.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from a Planet Transit:** When a planet transits, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of light blocked (the amplitude of the signal) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate the two scenarios:** We want the planet transit to produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots.\n    Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n\n4.  **Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):**\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of Brightness Variation:** The star's brightness varies because of its rotation. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the star is at its brightest. When the hemisphere with dark, cooler spots faces the observer, the star is at its dimmest. The amplitude of this variation is the signal we need to match.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux from the Star:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff): `F ∝ Teff^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Brightness at Maximum and Minimum:**\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is proportional to the star's normal temperature: `F_max ∝ Teff_star^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. This surface is a composite. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) has the spot temperature (`Teff_spot`), and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has the star's normal temperature (`Teff_star`). The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional change in flux:\n    *   Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 3 (the proportionality constants and area cancel out):\n        Amplitude = `(Teff_star^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4]) / Teff_star^4`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator gives: `f * (Teff_star^4 - Teff_spot^4)`\n    *   So, the full expression for the amplitude is:\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal:** When a planet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area. This fractional drop in brightness is the transit depth.\n    *   Transit Depth = `Area_planet / Area_star` = `(π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2)` = `(Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n6.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:** We need the transit depth to equal the amplitude of the spot signal.\n    *   `(Rpl / Rstar)^2` = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n    *   Therefore, the relative radius of the planet is:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4) ]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   `Teff_star` = 6000 K\n    *   `Teff_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem requires us to determine the relative radius of an exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) that would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by a large spotted region on a rotating star.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Spots:**\n    The flux (brightness) from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the unspotted hemisphere faces us, the flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature: `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of the surface is at a lower temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at `T_eff`. The total flux is a weighted sum: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n    The relative amplitude of the brightness change is:\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Signal from a Transiting Planet:**\n    The depth of a transit (the fractional dip in brightness) caused by an exoplanet is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n    `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n3.  **Equate the Signals and Solve for R_pl / R_star:**\n    The problem states that the amplitude from the spots is equal to the transit depth.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n    Therefore, the relative radius is:\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We can now substitute the given values into the equation:\n    *   Filling factor, `f = 0.20`\n    *   Star's temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n    The calculation was performed in the previous step, and the output confirmed the result.

The star has two distinct hemispheres: one \"clean\" and one partially covered by spots. The maximum brightness occurs when the clean hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n2.  We can model the flux (brightness) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n3.  Let `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. For a unit area, this is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n4.  Let `F_min` be the flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot` (20% or 0.2) covered by cool spots at `T_spot` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` at the star's normal temperature `T_eff`.

Dimming due to Starspots**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating starspots. We can model the flux (energy radiated per unit area) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **`T_star`**: Effective temperature of the star = 6000 K\n*   **`T_spot`**: Temperature of the dark spots = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **`f`**: Filling factor of spots on the active hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (`F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk radiates at `T_star`. So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n\nThe minimum flux (`F_min`) occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. In this case, a fraction `f` of the disk radiates at the cooler temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` radiates at `T_star`.\nSo, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting our expressions for flux (the proportionality constants and area will cancel out):\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### **2. Dimming due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of dimming (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### **3.

The flux (brightness per unit area) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (L_max):** Proportional to the flux from the unspotted photosphere.\n    L_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n*   **Minimum Flux (L_min):** A combination of the flux from the unspotted part (80% of the hemisphere) and the spotted part (20% of the hemisphere).\n    L_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴\n    Where `f_spot` is the spot filling factor (0.20), `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature (6000 K), and `T_spot` is the spot temperature (5000 K).\n\nThe relative amplitude of the variation is:\nAmplitude = (L_max - L_min) / L_max\nAmplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = [f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n**Step 2: Relate the amplitude to the exoplanet transit depth.**\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, δ) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nδ = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**Step 3: Equate the two effects and solve for the relative planet radius.**\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude to find the equivalent planet size.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop as a star's rotational modulation due to a large spotted region. This means we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness change from two different physical scenarios and set them equal.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Rotational Modulation due to Spots.** The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing us either a \"clean\" hemisphere or a \"spotted\" one. The difference between the maximum brightness (clean side) and minimum brightness (spotted side) defines the amplitude of this signal.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** An exoplanet passing in front of its star blocks a fraction of the star's light. The amount of dimming (the transit depth) is determined by the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size.\n\n**2. Formulate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nWe use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature difference of spots, `ΔT = 1000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f = 20% = 0.20`.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's temperature to the fourth power. Let's consider a unit projected area, so `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` of this hemisphere has a temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` has the normal temperature `T_eff`. The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation (`Amplitude_spots`):** The amplitude is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**3. Formulate the Brightness Variation from a Planet Transit**\n\nDuring a transit, the planet blocks a portion of the star's disk. The depth of the transit (the amplitude of the brightness drop) is simply the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star.\n\n*   Area of the planet's disk = `π * R_pl²`\n*   Area of the star's disk = `π * R_star²`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation (`Amplitude_planet`):**\n    `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe plug the given numerical values into the final equation. This calculation was performed using the Python script.\n\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe code output confirms this result precisely.\n\n**6.

This hemisphere's surface is a composite:\n    *   A fraction `(1 - f_spot) = 0.80` radiates at `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   A fraction `f_spot = 0.20` radiates at `T_spot = 5000 K`.\n\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the two components. The relative flux is:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum, calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225...)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51774...`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the equivalent exoplanet size.**\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe flux (brightness) emitted per unit area of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F_area = σT⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and `T` is the effective temperature.\n\nThe total flux from a stellar disk is the integral of the flux over the visible area. For this problem, we can simplify this by considering the relative flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us versus when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nLet `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. We can normalize the star's flux to 1 in this state.\n`F_max = 1`\n\nLet `F_min` be the flux when the hemisphere with spots faces us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot = 0.20` of its area covered by cooler spots. The rest of the area, `1 - f_spot = 0.80`, is at the normal effective temperature.\n\n*   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n\nThe flux `F_min` is a combination of the flux from the hot part and the cool part. The total flux from a region is proportional to `Area * T⁴`.\nSo, the flux from the spotted hemisphere is proportional to:\n`(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe relative flux drop, which is the amplitude of the signal, is `ΔF / F_max`:\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nTo calculate this, we compare the flux of a completely unspotted disk to a disk that is partially covered by spots.\n`ΔF = [Area_total * T_eff⁴] - [(Area_hot * T_eff⁴) + (Area_spot * T_spot⁴)]`\nSince `Area_total = Area_hot + Area_spot`, this simplifies to:\n`ΔF = Area_spot * T_eff⁴ - Area_spot * T_spot⁴ = Area_spot * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n\nThe fractional drop is `ΔF` relative to the flux of the unspotted area it replaces. The total flux of the star is `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴`. The flux drop is due to an area `f_spot * A_star` being cooler. So, the relative amplitude is:\n`Amplitude_spot = (f_spot * A_star * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)) / (A_star * T_eff⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = f_spot * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (0.51775) ≈ 0.10355`\n\n### 2. Brightness Drop from Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   Area of the planet, `A_pl = π * R_pl²`\n*   Area of the star, `A_star = π * R_star²`\n\nThe amplitude of the transit signal is:\n`Amplitude_transit = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 3. Equating the Amplitudes\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that produces the *same* amplitude signal.\n`Amplitude_transit = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe amplitude of the flux variation due to the spots is given by the formula:\nAmplitude = `f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nThe depth of a planetary transit is given by:\nTransit Depth = `(R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe are asked to find the relative planet radius (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = `f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation:\n*   `f_spot` = 0.20 (20% filling factor)\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` = 0.20 * 0.51775\n`(R_pl / R_star)²` ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we take the square root to find `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star` = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThe Python code executed this calculation and returned the value `0.32`, which matches our manual calculation.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe problem requires us to equate the drop in brightness caused by stellar spots with the drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n**1.

The flux is proportional to the full star's temperature: `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the observer sees the spotted hemisphere. The total flux is a weighted sum of the flux from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts. The filling factor `f` tells us that 20% of the area has temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (`1-f`) has temperature `T_star`.\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n    *   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional change in flux, which is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1-f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n        *   Simplifying the numerator: `T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴ = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = (f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)) / T_star⁴`\n        *   `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n3.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Dimming:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.

Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the relative change in flux as the star rotates.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. We can normalize its flux to 1, with a corresponding temperature of `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's flux is a combination of the hot, unspotted part and the cooler, spotted part.\n    *   Area of spots = 20% or `f_spot = 0.20`\n    *   Area of the hot photosphere = 80% or `1 - f_spot = 0.80`\n    *   Temperature of spots `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nThe total relative flux from the spotted face is the weighted average of the flux from its parts, compared to the unspotted face:\n\n`F_min / F_max = (1 - f_spot) * (T_eff / T_eff)⁴ + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = (0.80) + (0.20) * (5000 / 6000)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max = 0.80 + 0.20 * (5/6)⁴`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.20 * (0.48225)`\n`F_min / F_max ≈ 0.80 + 0.09645 = 0.89645`\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude ≈ 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the brightness of the star drops by about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This transit depth must be equal to the amplitude calculated above.\n\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude:\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root of this value:\n\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nA hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of about 0.32 times the radius of its star would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation caused by the described starspots. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\n\nThe core task is to equate the dimming effect of a rotating star with spots to the dimming effect of a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the size of the exoplanet (relative to its star) that would produce the same signal amplitude.\n\n### 2. Model the Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe total energy radiated by a star (its luminosity, L) is related to its radius (R) and its effective temperature (T_eff) via the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy per unit area) is F = σT⁴. The total flux we receive is proportional to the projected area of the star (A = πR²) multiplied by the average flux from that area.\n\nLet's define the two brightness states of the star as seen from Earth:\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`. The flux received is proportional to `A_star * T_eff⁴`, where `A_star` is the area of the star's disk.\n    `F_max ∝ A_star * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The visible disk is a composite of the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of this hemisphere covered by spots (filling factor) is `f = 0.20`.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part of the visible disk.\n        *   Flux from unspotted part: `(1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴`\n        *   Flux from spotted part: `f * A_star * T_spot⁴`\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴ + f * A_star * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe **amplitude of the signal** due to spots is the relative change in flux: `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (A_star * T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * A_star * T_eff⁴ + f * A_star * T_spot⁴]) / (A_star * T_eff⁴)`\n\nWe can cancel out the `A_star` term:\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_eff⁴ - (1 - f)T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n### 3. Model the Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit (the \"transit depth\") is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is simply the ratio of the planet's disk area (`A_pl = π * R_pl²`) to the star's disk area (`A_star = π * R_star²`), assuming a central transit.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius\n\nThe problem states that the signal amplitudes are the same:\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nTo find the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`, we take the square root of both sides:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.32`.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value `~0.32` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem asks us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would produce the same dip in brightness as a star with one hemisphere covered 20% by dark spots.\n\n**1. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) emitted by a star's surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `F ∝ T⁴`.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk emits at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    `F_{max} ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. On this side, a fraction `f = 0.2` (or 20%) of the surface is covered by spots, and the remaining `1 - f = 0.8` is the normal photosphere.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The flux is a weighted average of the flux from the normal photosphere and the spots.\n        `F_{min} ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude is the relative change in flux.\n    `Amplitude_spots = (F_{max} - F_{min}) / F_{max}`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the spots cause a brightness dip of about 10.36%.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting drop in brightness (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²)`\n*   `Amplitude_planet = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n**3. Equate the two Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius**\n\nWe need the amplitude from the planet transit to equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude_spots`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355`\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result means the hypothetical planet would need a radius of about 32.18% of the star's radius to produce the same signal.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from Starspots:** The brightness drop is caused by replacing a part of the star's hot surface with a cooler, spotted region. The energy radiated (flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Let the star's normal flux be proportional to T_star⁴.\n    *   Let the flux from the spots be proportional to T_spot⁴.\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) is 6000 K.\n    *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature (T_spot) is 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   When the spotted hemisphere is in view, 20% (or a fraction of 0.20) of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n\n    The fractional drop in flux (the amplitude of the signal) is calculated as:\n    Amplitude_spots = (Flux_unspotted - Flux_spotted) / Flux_unspotted\n    This simplifies to:\n    Amplitude_spots = filling_factor * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]\n    Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.1035\n\n2.  **Calculate the Flux Drop from a Planet Transit:** When a planet transits, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of light blocked (the amplitude of the signal) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n3.  **Equate the two scenarios:** We want the planet transit to produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots.\n    Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n    (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n\n4.  **Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):**\n    R_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n    R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of Brightness Variation:** The star's brightness varies because of its rotation. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the star is at its brightest. When the hemisphere with dark, cooler spots faces the observer, the star is at its dimmest. The amplitude of this variation is the signal we need to match.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux from the Star:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff): `F ∝ Teff^4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Brightness at Maximum and Minimum:**\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is proportional to the star's normal temperature: `F_max ∝ Teff_star^4`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. This surface is a composite. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) has the spot temperature (`Teff_spot`), and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` has the star's normal temperature (`Teff_star`). The total flux is a weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Amplitude of the Spot Signal:** The amplitude is the fractional change in flux:\n    *   Amplitude = `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 3 (the proportionality constants and area cancel out):\n        Amplitude = `(Teff_star^4 - [(1 - f) * Teff_star^4 + f * Teff_spot^4]) / Teff_star^4`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator gives: `f * (Teff_star^4 - Teff_spot^4)`\n    *   So, the full expression for the amplitude is:\n        Amplitude = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal:** When a planet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area. This fractional drop in brightness is the transit depth.\n    *   Transit Depth = `Area_planet / Area_star` = `(π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2)` = `(Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n6.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:** We need the transit depth to equal the amplitude of the spot signal.\n    *   `(Rpl / Rstar)^2` = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4)`\n    *   Therefore, the relative radius of the planet is:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4) ]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `f` = 0.20\n    *   `Teff_star` = 6000 K\n    *   `Teff_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation:\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` = `sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n        `Rpl / Rstar` ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe problem requires us to determine the relative radius of an exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) that would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by a large spotted region on a rotating star.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Spots:**\n    The flux (brightness) from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the unspotted hemisphere faces us, the flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature: `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of the surface is at a lower temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at `T_eff`. The total flux is a weighted sum: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n    The relative amplitude of the brightness change is:\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Signal from a Transiting Planet:**\n    The depth of a transit (the fractional dip in brightness) caused by an exoplanet is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n    `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n3.  **Equate the Signals and Solve for R_pl / R_star:**\n    The problem states that the amplitude from the spots is equal to the transit depth.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n    Therefore, the relative radius is:\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We can now substitute the given values into the equation:\n    *   Filling factor, `f = 0.20`\n    *   Star's temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 5000 K`\n\n    The calculation was performed in the previous step, and the output confirmed the result.

The star has two distinct hemispheres: one \"clean\" and one partially covered by spots. The maximum brightness occurs when the clean hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n2.  We can model the flux (brightness) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n3.  Let `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. For a unit area, this is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n4.  Let `F_min` be the flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot` (20% or 0.2) covered by cool spots at `T_spot` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` at the star's normal temperature `T_eff`.

Dimming due to Starspots**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating starspots. We can model the flux (energy radiated per unit area) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **`T_star`**: Effective temperature of the star = 6000 K\n*   **`T_spot`**: Temperature of the dark spots = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **`f`**: Filling factor of spots on the active hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (`F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk radiates at `T_star`. So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n\nThe minimum flux (`F_min`) occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. In this case, a fraction `f` of the disk radiates at the cooler temperature `T_spot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` radiates at `T_star`.\nSo, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting our expressions for flux (the proportionality constants and area will cancel out):\n\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n`Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n`Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### **2. Dimming due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The amount of dimming (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### **3.
