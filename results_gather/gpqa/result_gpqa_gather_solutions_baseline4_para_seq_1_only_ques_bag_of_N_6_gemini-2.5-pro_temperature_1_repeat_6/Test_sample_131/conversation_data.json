There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\n**1. Analyze the requirements from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio). Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute a signal (or signals) for its aromatic protons, and the total number of protons represented by each of the two final singlets must be equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. All signals are singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbons (e.g., no ethyl or propyl groups). This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Since they are equivalent and adjacent, they behave as a single group and produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will show a **quartet** (CH2, 4H) and a **triplet** (CH3, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 alkyl quartet, 1 alkyl triplet. This is immediately ruled out as the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option to see if it matches the observed spectrum (2 aromatic singlets in 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and triplet.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1** integral ratio (2H:2H). This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two aromatic protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). Therefore, they will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also unique. This gives a third **singlet** integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent (ortho to each other). They will couple and split each other's signals, appearing as **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a -CH2- (methylene) and a -CH3 (methyl) group.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be split by the -CH3 protons into a **quartet** (4H total).\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be split by the -CH2- protons into a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because the problem specifies only aliphatic singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the two compounds in the mixture must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, as the other two options would produce signals (doublets, quartets, triplets) that are not observed. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the spectral data.\n\n**Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second signal.\n        *   The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called isochrony) and overlap to form a single 6H signal.\n    *   This configuration (12H, 6H, 6H) perfectly matches the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets of 1H each.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio of 4H corresponds to two signals, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if:\n        *   The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one signal.\n        *   The two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally isochronous, overlapping to form a second 2H signal at a different chemical shift.\n    *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that can produce the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other options are ruled out due to incorrect signal multiplicities (splitting patterns).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two different compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: There are two protons at C4 and C6. These are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is between a methyl and a hydrogen). They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as a **multiplet** (specifically, an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), not a singlet. This is a key point.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This would give two singlets of 6H each.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Use a Process of Elimination based on the Spectral Data**\n\nWe can now eliminate options based on the characteristics of the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are \"all singlets\". **1,4-diethylbenzene** produces a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The problem states that the aromatic signals are \"two singlets\". **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has two adjacent aromatic protons, which would result in a multiplet, not a singlet. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Remaining Option**\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture of these two isomers, the total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4H. A 1:1 ratio means each signal must integrate to 2H. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally isochronous\" (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single 2H singlet. The mixture would then show two 2H singlets (one from each compound), which perfectly matches the 1:1 ratio description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This perfectly describes the spectrum of pure **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   What about the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB? For the final spectrum of the mixture to have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the total integration. Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from the components:\n        *   Signal 1 (12H): This comes directly from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 2 (6H): This comes from the 6H singlet of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 3 (6H): This must be formed by the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB being accidentally isochronous and overlapping.\n    *   This explanation, while requiring two separate instances of accidental signal overlap, is the only one that logically fits all the data provided. Such simplifications are common in spectroscopy problems.\n\nThe process of elimination is the most straightforward path to the solution. The compounds that do not produce singlets in the specified regions can be immediately ruled out, leaving only one possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates a lack of adjacent, non-equivalent protons that would cause spin-spin splitting.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl groups. They will produce **two alkyl singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two aromatic singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. One might expect four separate alkyl singlets. However, due to very similar electronic environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a quartet and the -CH3 group will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Option**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and alkyl regions is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, 1,2,3,4-):** A benzene ring (C6) with 4 methyl groups (4 x CH3) and 2 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** A benzene ring (C6) with 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) and 4 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = **C10H14**. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to predict the number of signals, multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and integration for the protons in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl at 2 is unique.\n        *   Methyl at 5 is unique.\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent.

Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 adjacent CH2 protons). Integration: **6H**.\n    *   Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectra of the Possible Mixtures:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's test the combination from option D, which involves the two compounds that seem most promising.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D):**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine their spectra for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 2H) and one singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 2H). Assuming they appear at slightly different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H) and two singlets from Compound 2 (relative intensities 6H and 6H). This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the question for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All the options given (tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene) have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14.\n2.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The presence of two signals means there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, the simplest explanation is that Compound A gives one aromatic singlet and Compound B gives another aromatic singlet at a slightly different chemical shift.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same. For tetramethylbenzenes, there are two aromatic protons (C6H2(CH3)4), so each compound would contribute a 2H singlet. This fits the data perfectly.\n3.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups.\n    *   This is the spectrum of the *entire mixture*. Since we have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds, each having 12 non-aromatic protons, the total integration in this region corresponds to 24 protons.\n    *   Let's calculate the number of protons for each signal based on the 2:1:1 ratio:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H.\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum must show three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the given compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The molecule has ethyl groups. Due to spin-spin coupling between the CH2 and CH3 protons, the spectrum will show a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately because the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the observed spectrum:\n*   Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations 12H, 6H, and 6H (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nLet's test the pairs given in the options. We are looking for a combination whose individual aliphatic signals add up to {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: This would give a minimum of three signals {6H+6H, 3H, 3H} = {12H, 3H, 3H} if one set of 6H peaks overlaps. This does not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene signals: {12H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: The set of signals would be {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three, and the integrations do not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene signals: **{12H}**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **{6H, 6H}**\n    *   Combined: If we add these signals together, we get exactly the required set of three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's check the aromatic region for this pair. Durene gives one 2H singlet, and Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires us to determine which two compounds, from a given list, are present in a 1:1 mixture based on its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (splitting pattern), and their relative integration. All alkyl groups are methyls except for 1,4-diethylbenzene, so we expect singlets for the tetramethylbenzenes.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry between C1-C2 and C4-C5, and another between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will produce a single signal. This will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they will be **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection across the symmetry plane (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce a single signal. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence results in a **singlet** (or a complex pattern that looks like a singlet) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   These two sets are in different environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**, giving a **1:1** ratio.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the CH2 group are adjacent to the three protons of the CH3 group, so they will be split into a quartet. The protons of the CH3 group are adjacent to the two protons of the CH2 group, so they will be split into a triplet. The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture for Each Option**\n\nNow let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show four singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, assuming they have different chemical shifts, this will result in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H = **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. In a mixture, this will result in **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show up to five singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nSince the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally to the total number of protons observed.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each of the four possible compounds to predict their individual 1H NMR spectra. All have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is between a methyl group and another hydrogen's previous position (C6 is between C1-Me and C5-Me). They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because of the symmetry (they are magnetically equivalent), they do not split each other. They will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (from the 2x -CH2- groups, 4H total) and a **triplet** (from the 2x -CH3 groups, 6H total).\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals that are not all singlets (a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (unless there's accidental overlap, which is a less likely scenario to assume). This contradicts the \"two signals, 1:1 ratio\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would also result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal (2H from Durene vs. 2H from Prehnitene). This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integral ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum is consistent with all the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given spectral data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals (singlets) around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates that there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound**\n\nAll four candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.

They will produce a second, distinct singlet integrating to 6H.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (6H each)\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way the others do.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen) are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals, two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, C5) are in unique chemical environments. We would expect four distinct singlets, each integrating to 3H. (Note: Sometimes, accidental overlap can reduce the number of observed signals, but based on pure symmetry, we expect four).\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each)\n        *   Aliphatic: 4 singlets (3H each)\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite (para) positions.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would show characteristic coupling. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet. The problem states that all signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option A.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options based on a 1:1 mixture**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in the remaining options.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Since these are different compounds, their aromatic signals will likely have different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H, giving an integral ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming no accidental overlap). The integral ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum matching the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   **Two signals:** This means there are two chemically non-equivalent types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **Singlets:** This means that these aromatic protons are not adjacent to any other protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1:1 ratio:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   **Three signals:** There are three chemically non-equivalent types of aliphatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **All singlets:** This indicates that these protons are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons they can couple with (e.g., they are attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon). This rules out ethyl groups which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **2:1:1 ratio:** This describes the relative number of protons for each of the three signals. Since both molecules are C10H14 tetramethylbenzenes, the total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first molecule) + 12 (from the second molecule) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio on 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 12 protons\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination that produces three methyl signals with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Spectra of Individual Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The aliphatic region would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This would theoretically produce four different singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (very similar chemical shifts), the spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures (The Options)**\n\nNow let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** One 12H singlet + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives a total of four signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives multiplets, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals arise from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Aliphatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Assuming the three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed NMR data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Options:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula (C10H14) for each option and predict its 1H NMR spectrum based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4 (ring) + 2 * C2H5 (ethyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectrum:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet (4H). The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3- protons. This will produce a quartet (4H total) and a triplet (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not give only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry runs horizontally and vertically through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment than the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule lacks the high symmetry of the other isomers. All four methyl groups and both aromatic protons are in chemically unique environments (Point Group C1).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are non-equivalent and not coupled to each other. This should result in **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are non-equivalent. This should result in **four singlets**, each integrating to **3H** (though accidental overlap could reduce this number, as seen in databases).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), up to 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,4-, and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) produces the described spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. The combination would result in up to three signals, or two signals with a 3:1 ratio if there's overlap. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals (assuming they have different chemical shifts) would appear as **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination of these gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. This combination would result in up to three signals or two signals with a 3:1 ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose combined 1H NMR spectrum matches the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for all compounds is given as C10H14. Let's verify this for the four options.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is also correct for 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The key information is from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound to see how they would combine in a mixture. We are looking for the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration (number of protons).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets correspond to the same number of protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The signals are all singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling for the alkyl groups. This rules out any ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. Therefore, option **A) is incorrect**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons (methyl groups) in a 1:1 mixture of any two tetramethylbenzenes is 12 + 12 = 24 protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratios is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, produce three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**3. Predict the Spectra for the Remaining Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. We use symmetry to determine chemical equivalence.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, the coupling is often not resolved for such symmetrical systems, leading to **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This produces **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we test the combinations in options B, C, and D to see which one produces the observed spectrum {Aromatic: two 1:1 singlets; Alkyl: three singlets with 12H, 6H, 6H integration}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals unless there is overlap. No combination of these produces the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {12H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals. To get three signals, we would have to assume the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift. This would result in signals of {12H, 6H, 6H}, matching the required pattern. However, this relies on an assumption of accidental equivalence between chemically different methyl groups (one is between two methyls, the other is between two hydrogens), which is less likely than a solution that requires no such assumptions.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n        *   Combined signals in the mixture: **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the NMR spectrum directly, without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct.\n*   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is correct.\n\nNext, we predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. These two sets are not equivalent to each other. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon C5, which has a methyl) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** Detailed analysis (or looking up reference spectra) shows three sets of equivalent protons. Two methyl groups are accidentally equivalent. This results in **three singlets** with an integration of 6H:3H:3H (or a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a **quartet** and the -CH3 group will be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets in the alkyl region, so we can immediately eliminate this compound and **Option D**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A, B, C)**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Total Aromatic Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 2 (from compound 1) + 2 (from compound 2) = 4H. The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. This means the signals must correspond to 2H and 2H.\n*   **Total Methyl Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24H. The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H (since 12 + 6 + 6 = 24, and 12:6:6 = 2:1:1).\n\nLet's test the remaining options against these requirements.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This would give three signals (2H:1H:1H) unless the two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5- accidentally overlap perfectly to give a 2H signal. This is possible but relies on coincidence.\n    *   Alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of five signals. To get the required three signals (12H, 6H, 6H) would require multiple, complex overlaps. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This again gives three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 1H signals.\n    *   Alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives four signals. It could be reduced to three if the two 3H signals overlap, but the resulting integrations would be 12H, 6H, 6H (a 2:1:1 ratio). This fits the alkyl region but relies on two separate coincidental overlaps (one in the aromatic, one in the alkyl).\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, these two non-equivalent compounds will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H. The ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. Combining these gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data without requiring any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Check the molecular formula of the options:**\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (TMB):** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 4 hydrogens with 4 methyl (CH3) groups gives C6H2(CH3)4, which simplifies to C10H14. All three TMB isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) have the correct formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 2 hydrogens with 2 ethyl (C2H5) groups gives C6H4(C2H5)2, which simplifies to C10H14. This also has the correct formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\nThe key is to use molecular symmetry to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons, which corresponds to the number of signals.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, and the four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The ethyl group would produce a **quartet** (for the CH2) and a **triplet** (for the CH3) due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The problem states all signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, coupling between equivalent protons is not observed, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, corresponding to a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Analyze the mixture based on the individual spectra:**\n\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 1:1 singlets. Since each of the three TMB isomers gives one aromatic singlet (2H), a 1:1 mixture of any two will give two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This condition is met by options A, B, and C.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the three peaks correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This does not match the required three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined signals: This gives a total of exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: This would naturally produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). To get the observed three signals, it would require an accidental overlap (identical chemical shift) of two non-equivalent signals. While not impossible, the scenario in option B provides a direct and unambiguous explanation without requiring such a coincidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that naturally produces the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the spectral data provided:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group). It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry (Cs point group) that passes through the C2-CH3 and C5-CH3 groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are reflected onto each other by the plane of symmetry, making them chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry (Cs point group) that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so they will couple and split each other's signals. This will result in a **multiplet (an AB quartet or a pair of doublets)**, not a singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H total), and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H total). This gives two **singlets** in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic multiplet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in one **singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will appear as a **quartet** (4H), and the CH3 protons will appear as a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis (Two singlets, 1:1 ratio):**\n    *   The mixture must contain two compounds that *each* produce an aromatic singlet. This immediately rules out any combination containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, which produces a multiplet. So, options A and B are incorrect.\n    *   The mixture cannot contain **1,4-diethylbenzene**. Its aromatic singlet corresponds to 4H. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-TMB (2H singlet) or 1,2,3,5-TMB (2H singlet), the aromatic signal ratio would be 4H:2H or 2:1, not 1:1. So, option D is incorrect.\n    *   The only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which has a 2H aromatic singlet) and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which also has a 2H aromatic singlet). In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets would have a 1:1 integration ratio, perfectly matching the data. This points directly to option C.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis (Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio):**\n    *   Let's confirm that Option C also explains the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides one singlet of 12H intensity.\n    *   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-TMB):** Provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n    *   The problem states that a total of only **three** aliphatic singlets are observed in the mixture. This implies an *accidental overlap* of signals.\n    *   Let's assume there is an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This is a common occurrence. These two signals would merge into a single signal with an intensity of 6H.\n    *   So, the signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        3.  The combined 6H (3H + 3H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n    *   This gives three total aliphatic signals with an integration of 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

Assuming they have different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets** in a 2:2 or **1:1 ratio**. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4-TMB. This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **(Match)**\n*   This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in four distinct alkyl singlets. **(Mismatch)**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. Even with a potential overlap of one of the 6H signals, this would result in at least four signals (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), not three. **(Mismatch)**\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem requires analyzing the 1H NMR spectra of several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and one isomer of diethylbenzene to determine which two are present in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are at C5 and C6. They are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because it does not produce aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3) will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates:**\nThe only two compounds that fit the \"singlets only\" criteria are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Since the two compounds are different, their aromatic protons will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is two singlets. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H).\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed in the alkyl region. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The total number of parts in the ratio is 2+1+1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's match these required integrals (12H, 6H, 6H) with the signals from our two compounds:\n        *   The 12H signal comes from the single methyl signal of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The 6H signal comes from the equivalent C1/C3 methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The remaining 6H signal must come from the overlap of the two 3H signals (from C2 and C5 methyls) of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. While the C2 and C5 methyls are not equivalent by symmetry, it is common for signals with similar chemical environments to overlap accidentally. *Correction*: In the spectrum of the mixture, this 6H signal could also arise from an overlap of a signal from one compound with a signal from the other. However, the most straightforward explanation that generates signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H from the available signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) is the one described. The key is that the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone (6H, 3H, 3H) have the same ratio (2:1:1) as the observed signals in the mixture, but the presence of the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene alters the overall integration. The given 2:1:1 ratio refers to the final combined spectrum, which must integrate to 12H:6H:6H.\n    *   The combination of signals from these two compounds is the only one that can produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two compounds in the mixture must be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 1s (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. This would ideally give four separate singlets. However, due to similar environments, some signals may overlap. A common pattern observed is three signals: one for the two most similar methyls (e.g., at C1 and C3) and two separate signals for the others, resulting in signals with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1). For our analysis, we will note it produces more than 2 aliphatic signals.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 2s (1H, 1H); Aliphatic: 3 or 4 singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 2s (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving **one singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. We would expect a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be ruled out because its aliphatic signals are not singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of compounds, this means each compound must contribute an equal number of protons to a signal. The simplest way this occurs is if each compound produces one singlet corresponding to 2H.\n    *   Durene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Prehnitene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Isodurene: No (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   This strongly suggests the mixture must be Durene and Prehnitene.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Requirement:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the integrals of the signals are:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    We need a mixture that produces singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's check our proposed mixture: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   Assuming these three signals do not overlap, the mixture will show three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the components of a 1:1 mixture by analyzing its combined 1H NMR spectrum and comparing it to the expected spectra of four possible aromatic compounds.\n\n### **1.

A horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry pass through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They are meta to each other, so any coupling would be very small, and they appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        All methyls are attached to carbons with no protons, so all signals are **singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14.

However, they are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signal, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14.

The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will be a **triplet (6H)** due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nBy elimination, the mixture must contain **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, these will appear as **two singlets** at slightly different chemical shifts, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of their integrations will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's sum the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = **24H total**.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a **2:1:1** ratio. Let's find the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Protons per part = 24H / 4 = 6H.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n    *   Now, let's see if our two compounds can produce these signals (12H, 6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one signal: a **12H singlet**.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds, from a given list, corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nLet's analyze the molecular formula and structure of each option to predict its spectrum. All listed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons. Thus, they will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is adjacent to one methyl group, while the proton at C6 is flanked by two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct signals**. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be **singlets**, each corresponding to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the mirror plane). They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry.

They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will appear as a **quartet** (split by the adjacent CH3), and the methyl (CH3) protons will appear as a **triplet** (split by the adjacent CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out immediately.\n\n**4.

This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** The spectrum would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB and a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. This **does not match** the data, which specifies only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on the provided 1H NMR spectrum data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds. This means that for every molecule of compound X, there is one molecule of compound Y.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to a CH or CH2 group, or an ethyl group where coupling is not resolved or absent.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 is unique, and the proton at position 6 is unique. They are not adjacent. This will result in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2 is unique (3H); the one at C5 is unique (3H); and the ones at C1 and C3 are equivalent to each other (6H). This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, which would normally create a doublet. However, because they are chemically equivalent, they behave as a singlet in many common cases (an AA' system) or a more complex pattern. Given the simple data, it's most likely treated as a singlet for this level of problem. Assuming they appear as a singlet due to equivalence, this gives a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: those at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H), and those at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, creating a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons, creating a **triplet (6H)**. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately **ruled out**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixtures Based on the Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data. We need a combination that results in 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. Total: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. Total: **Three singlets**. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is invalid because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** (or two if there's accidental overlap), with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only combination that produces an NMR spectrum consistent with the experimental data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Structure of Candidates**\nThe molecular formula C10H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4`), which corresponds to a substituted benzene ring.\nThe substituents must account for C4H8.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The four methyl groups (4 x CH3) are C4H12. This doesn't match C4H8. Let's recalculate. The benzene core is C6. The substituents are C4H14. This is consistent with four methyl groups (C4H12) on a C6H2 ring (total C10H14) or two ethyl groups (C4H10) on a C6H4 ring (total C10H14).\n\nLet's examine the 1H NMR spectrum predicted for each option based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1-Me and C3-Me are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   C5-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not a singlet. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl group protons (CH2 and CH3) are not singlets. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons into a triplet. The problem explicitly states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n### **3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\n*   The aromatic region shows two separate singlets. This means the mixture must contain two different compounds, and *each* must produce a single singlet in its aromatic spectrum.\n*   Based on our analysis in step 2, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would give doublets, and 1,4-diethylbenzene has been ruled out by the aliphatic signals.\n*   Therefore, the two compounds must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### **4. Verify the Aliphatic Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds produces the observed aliphatic spectrum.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes one singlet of 12H intensity.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n\nThe problem states the final spectrum of the mixture shows **three signals** with a ratio of **2:1:1**. This implies that some of the signals from the individual compounds overlap (are accidentally degenerate) in the mixture's spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals from the 1:1 mixture:\n1.  A singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H).\n2.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 6H).\n3.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n4.  Another singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n\nTo get only three signals, two of these must overlap. The most plausible scenario that fits the 2:1:1 ratio is if the two 3H signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** are accidentally degenerate (i.e., they have the same chemical shift).\n\nIf this overlap occurs, the signals in the mixture's spectrum would be:\n*   **Signal 1:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H (from C1/C3-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 3:** 3H + 3H = 6H (from the overlapped C2- and C5-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n\nThe integration ratio of these three signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental data provided in the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe two compounds in the 1:1 mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two of these compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are looking at a mixture of two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This happens when the adjacent carbons are substituted (have no protons).\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that for each molecule of compound A, there is one molecule of compound B, and the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 1 is equal to the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 2.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the signals are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to other protons. This is typical for methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" tells us the relative number of protons in each of these three environments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number and type of signals for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  CH3 at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other and will couple. This technically produces an AB quartet or a more complex multiplet. But in many cases, especially with low-resolution spectra, if the chemical shift difference is zero, it can be simplified or appear as **one singlet (2H)**. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent and will appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 will be a quartet and the CH3 will be a triplet. Since the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures Given in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's analyze the valid options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals would come from Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) and Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a total of up to 5 signals, which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this produces two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. (This part fits).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic signals. This does not match the observed three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This option perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem description without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that directly accounts for all the observed signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify which pair of compounds, from the given options and in a 1:1 mixture, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals.\n    *   Both signals are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are not equivalent to each other. Each type gives a singlet, meaning its protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each singlet must arise from the same number of protons in its respective molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are three signals.\n    *   All signals are singlets. This indicates the protons (likely from methyl groups) are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 'N'. The three signals represent groups of protons in the ratio of (2/4)*N, (1/4)*N, and (1/4)*N.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14. All four are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, with the formula C6H2(CH3)4 or C6H4(C2H5)2, both of which are C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry), all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent.\n    *   This also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets with an integration of 6H (from Me-1 + Me-3), 3H (from Me-2), and 3H (from Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Such an A2 (or more accurately, AA') system appears as a singlet.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Two singlets, one for Me-1+Me-4 (6H) and one for Me-2+Me-3 (6H). The ratio is 6:6 or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 and CH3 protons within the ethyl group are not equivalent and will couple.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One quartet (4H, from the -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, from the -CH3-). This does not match the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and so can option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the two components. We need a combination that gives **two aromatic singlets** (1:1 ratio) and **three aliphatic singlets** (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nSince 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB, and 1,2,3,4-TMB all produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region, any 1:1 mixture of two of these will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So, the deciding factor will be the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's examine the aliphatic signals for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet.\n    *   Total signals: up to 5 singlets. To get the observed 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific signal overlap would be required. This is a complex and less likely scenario.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total signals: This combination naturally provides **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Total signals: four singlets. To match the observed spectrum, we would have to assume that the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally degenerate\" (have the exact same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from the overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it is an assumption.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) directly and simply explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum. It provides two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with an exact 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H) without needing to assume any accidental signal overlap. This is the most straightforward and chemically sound explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds:**\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n        *   Aliphatic: One singlet (12H, from 4 x CH3).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H4 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Three singlets. One for the C1/C3 methyls (6H), one for the C2 methyl (3H), and one for the C5 methyl (3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes the protons at C5 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H5 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Two singlets. One for the C1/C4 methyls (6H) and one for the C2/C3 methyls (6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. All four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (4H).\n        *   Aliphatic: The ethyl groups would show coupling. A quartet for the CH2 protons and a triplet for the CH3 protons.\n    *   The problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1 and all three candidate tetramethylbenzenes have a 2H aromatic singlet, any pair of them would produce two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This observation confirms that there are two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of methyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we need a combination of two compounds that gives one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would result in three 6H signals and two 3H signals (assuming no overlap), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets. The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would give four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that produces the observed NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options to see which pair could produce the observed mixture spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are in different environments and will produce **two different aromatic singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent by symmetry, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at 2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at 5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons are part of ethyl groups. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will couple to the methyl (-CH3) protons, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets. Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, this compound can be immediately eliminated. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Combinations**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the molecules are different, their singlets will have different chemical shifts. The mixture will therefore show **two aromatic singlets**. Because they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, their integrals will be equal, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Assuming all three signals have unique chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data (which specifies two aromatic singlets).\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) correctly predicts the number and integration ratios of all signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons represented by each singlet must be equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are singlets, which means there is no splitting between adjacent protons. This suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups (or other groups with no adjacent protons, like t-butyl, but methyl fits the formula).\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and expected 1H NMR spectra of the possible compounds:**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula for all options.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C6+4 H4+10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow, let's predict the spectrum for each compound individually, focusing on the number of signals and their integration, based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 and C4 equivalent, C2 and C3 equivalent, and H5 and H6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The CH2 group would be a **quartet** and the CH3 group would be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options as a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two** aromatic singlets and **three** aliphatic singlets. Since each pure tetramethylbenzene isomer gives only one aromatic singlet, a mixture of any two of them will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, which is a safe bet). Since the mixture is 1:1 and each aromatic signal comes from 2 protons, the 1:1 integration ratio in the aromatic region is satisfied by any pair. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's check the combination of aliphatic signals for each option.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of four aliphatic signals, unless some accidentally overlap. To get three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap perfectly to form a single 6H signal. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it requires an assumption of accidental overlap.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of five aliphatic signals. To get three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and multiple accidental overlaps would be required. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined, this mixture naturally produces **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   The integration of these signals would be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of integration is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This matches the experimental data perfectly without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n*   All options provided are isomers with this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture. This means the total signal intensity from each compound is equal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   The presence of only singlets for the alkyl groups is a very strong clue. It means none of the protons on the alkyl carbons are adjacent to other protons. This is characteristic of methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon, but not ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl, or isopropyl groups, which would show splitting (quartets, triplets, etc.).\n*   Let's examine **1,4-diethylbenzene**. The two ethyl groups would produce a quartet (for the -CH2- protons) and a triplet (for the -CH3 protons) in the aliphatic region. This contradicts the data that all signals are singlets.\n*   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces **one singlet** in the aromatic region, and these two singlets have slightly different chemical shifts.\n*   Let's predict the aromatic signals for the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6). Due to the planes of symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has less symmetry. There are two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6). The proton at C4 is in a different chemical environment from the proton at C6. Therefore, they are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**. This compound does *not* fit the requirement of producing only one aromatic signal. This rules out options B and D, as they both contain this compound.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two adjacent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (which would normally lead to splitting), because they are chemically and magnetically equivalent, they behave as a single group and produce a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n**4. Confirm the correct pair by analyzing the combined Aliphatic Signals**\n\n*   Based on the aromatic signals, the only possible pair is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option C). Let's verify this by checking if their combined aliphatic signals match the data (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12 protons (4 x CH3).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second **singlet** (6H).\n\n*   **Combining the spectra:**\n    *   In the 1:1 mixture, we will see the signals from both compounds.\n    *   Total number of aliphatic singlets = 1 (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 2 (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) = **3 singlets**. This matches the data.\n    *   The integrals of these three signals will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the given NMR data (aromatic and aliphatic regions) is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3) due to spin-spin coupling. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n**3. Analyze the spectra of the proposed mixtures (in a 1:1 ratio).**\n\nWe are looking for a combination that gives:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\nSince all three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers have one singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, any 1:1 mixture of two different isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each integrating to 2H, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor will be the signals from the methyl groups.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show three singlets in the aliphatic region with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mixture perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture would show up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, the ratio would be (6+6+6):3:3 or 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show four singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:3:3, which simplifies to 4:2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that matches the experimental data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (¹H NMR):** Two singlets, ratio 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (¹H NMR):** Three singlets, ratio 2:1:1.\n\nWe need to identify the two compounds from the given options:\n1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **2. Verify Molecular Formula and Analyze Individual Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula and predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through C4 and C1-C2.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:6H**, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical para-substituted benzene.\n    *   Aromatic protons: All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: The ethyl groups have methylene (-CH2-) and methyl (-CH3) protons. Due to spin-spin coupling, these will not be singlets.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet (4H)**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, as the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds from the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Each of the three candidate isomers (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) produces a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region.\n*   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will show two singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different), each integrating to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H or 1:1.\n*   This information confirms we have a mixture of two of these isomers but doesn't differentiate between the possible pairs.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound A) + 12H (from compound B) = 24H.\n*   The total ratio is 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n*   We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Therefore, the mixture must have three aliphatic singlets corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\nNow, let's see which pair of compounds produces this pattern:\n*   **Aliphatic signals from individuals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one signal for 12H\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two signals for 6H each\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: three signals for 6H, 3H, 3H\n\n*   **Consider the mixture from option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Let's check other combinations to be sure:**\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option D):** Signals would be {12H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in four signals. To get three signals, an accidental overlap would be required, but no simple overlap yields a 2:1:1 ratio of the total 24H.\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option B):** Signals would be {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This gives up to five signals. Again, this combination cannot simply produce the {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern required.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that directly explains the observed ¹H NMR data for the mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Information Given**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    - Alkyl Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons would appear as a **quartet (4H)** and the CH3 protons as a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would produce quartets and triplets, but the problem states all observed signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons (on other carbons) and are equivalent to each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups and the center of the ring.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **3. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum for Each Option**\n\nNow, we combine the spectra of the individual compounds for each option, assuming a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** The spectrum of the mixture shows **two** singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers individually produces only **one** aromatic singlet (of intensity 2H), the mixture must contain two different isomers whose aromatic singlets appear at different chemical shifts. As both singlets originate from 2 protons, their ratio will naturally be 1:1. All remaining options (A, C, D) are pairs of different isomers and are thus plausible based on the aromatic region alone.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** This is the decisive part. The mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's see which pair produces this pattern.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet of intensity 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets, each of intensity 6H.\n        *   **Combined:** Assuming these three signals appear at different chemical shifts, we would get three singlets with intensities 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **12:6:6**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This combination perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in a total of four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in up to five different alkyl singlets. To get only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio (i.e., intensities 12H, 6H, 6H from a total of 24 methyl protons), multiple specific, accidental overlaps would need to occur. This is a much less likely and less straightforward explanation than Option A.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) is the only pair that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two 2H singlets give a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** One 12H singlet and two 6H singlets give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectra of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal will be a **singlet**. The integration will be for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet**, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetric. There are no simple planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 and the proton at position 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct signals**. Since they are meta to each other, the coupling is negligible, so both signals appear as **singlets**. Each integrates to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups in different environments. One might expect four separate signals. However, due to very similar chemical environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three singlet signals** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**. Since they are equivalent, they don't split each other, appearing as a **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlet signals**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** that integrates to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH₂) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH₃), and the methyl (CH₃) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH₂).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and compare with the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). This mixture will show **two aromatic singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The total spectrum will have **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: This mixture would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB, but also a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. The experimental data states there are only **three singlets** in the alkyl region. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that fits all the spectral data is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The presence of two distinct signals implies we are seeing signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n    *   For the ratio to be 1:1 in a 1:1 mixture, each signal must arise from the same number of protons.\n    *   Since there are only two signals in total for the mixture, it is most likely that each compound contributes exactly one singlet in this region. Therefore, we are looking for two compounds that each have only one type of aromatic proton.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals must come from the methyl (CH3) or ethyl (CH2CH3) groups. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, suggesting the protons on the alkyl groups are not coupled to any other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups attached to the aromatic ring. Ethyl groups would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic singlet.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent, but because they are chemically equivalent, they will appear as **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and the C5-methyl group) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   *This compound alone would produce two aromatic signals. Therefore, it cannot be part of a mixture that has only two aromatic signals in total (one from each component).* This eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Options A, C, and D).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are *singlets*. An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Verify the correct combination:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the only possible combination is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB (1:1 molar ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   Total: Two singlets. Since they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each from 6H).\n    *   Total: Three singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio of these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives a simplified ratio of **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the identity of two C10H14 isomers in a 1:1 mixture by interpreting their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the problem description:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, and all have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14.\n2.  **Mixture:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio, combined with the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same.\n    *   Since both are singlets, the aromatic protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons (or they are equivalent to the protons they would couple with).\n4.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals are singlets, which suggests they come from methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to any protons. This is consistent with tetramethylbenzene isomers but rules out diethylbenzene (which would show coupled ethyl group signals - a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   Let's determine the number of protons corresponding to this ratio. Since both compounds are tetramethylbenzene isomers, each molecule has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 total aliphatic protons.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   Protons for signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Protons for signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Protons for signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's aliphatic region must contain three singlets corresponding to environments with 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the Individual 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each possible compound. We can immediately eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** because its ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {12H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 (3H) and C5 (3H) are each unique. This results in **three singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but chemically equivalent, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other (6H). This results in **two singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 6H}\n\n### Step 3: Test the Combinations (Options) Against the Spectral Data\n\nNow we combine the predicted signals for each pair of compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see which combination matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Observed Spectrum:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations {12H, 6H, 6H}\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect (unless there's an unlikely accidental overlap of the two 3H signals to form a 6H signal, which would lead to a {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. But we should prefer a more direct explanation).\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 6H}. This combination provides exactly three singlets with the required 12H:6H:6H integration. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region.\n*   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the chemical environments of these protons are different in the two molecules, they will appear at different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in at least three unique signal sets, likely more. It does not match the observed {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains both the aliphatic and aromatic regions of the described 1H NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given 1H NMR data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all compounds. A quick check confirms this for all four options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(ring) + 4 x CH3 = C10H14.\n        *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(ring) + 2 x C2H5 = C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second aromatic signal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that the number of aromatic protons per molecule for each of the two compounds is the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) protons. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no adjacent proton to cause splitting (i.e., no H on an adjacent carbon). This is true for methyl groups on a benzene ring, but not for ethyl groups.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   All four methyl groups are also equivalent. They will produce **one aliphatic singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H), and the methyl at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H). This gives **three aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is 2:1:1.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (second signal, 6H). This gives **two aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   The ethyl groups give a quartet (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options against the experimental data:**\n\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The data shows two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   A mixture of any compound with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H singlet) and a tetramethylbenzene (2H singlet) would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 integration ratio, not 1:1. This immediately **eliminates option C**.\n        *   A mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzenes (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) would work for the aromatic region, as each gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would result in two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The data shows three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. We need to check the combinations from the remaining options (A, B, D).\n\n        *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Total: Three singlets.\n            *   Integration: 12H : 6H : 6H.\n            *   Ratio: **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n        *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Four singlets. This contradicts the \"three signals\" observation. The integration ratio would be 12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1, which is also incorrect.\n\n        *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, we would have four signals (one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H signals), which gives an incorrect number of signals and an incorrect ratio (12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features of the spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (or appear as singlets) is crucial. This means that the protons giving rise to each signal are not coupled to any non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This would produce a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with. This produces **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, they form an AA' system which appears as **one singlet (2H)** in the spectrum.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but they are in a different chemical environment from the C1/C4 pair. This produces **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This produces **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This would produce **four different singlets (3H each)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three signals (unless there is accidental overlap), which does not match \"two signals\".\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (2 singlets, 6H each) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to six signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). Again, this would result in three signals, not two.\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (1 singlet, 12H) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to five signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal, resulting in a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Assuming these three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 ratio is the only option that produces a 1H NMR spectrum matching all the described features.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   All candidate compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the same molecular formula: C10H14.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The total number of protons per molecule is 14.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, the fact that the signals have a 1:1 intensity ratio means that each signal arises from the same number of protons.\n    *   This strongly suggests that we are mixing two compounds, each of which produces a single, distinct singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons responsible for each singlet is identical.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals must be the sum of all the alkyl proton signals from the two compounds in the mixture.\n    *   Let's determine the total number of protons represented by this alkyl region. All C10H14 isomers with a benzene ring and only methyl/ethyl substituents are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: 4 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH3. This leaves 6 - 4 = 2 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 4 * 3 = 12. Total = 2 + 12 = 14.\n        *   Diethylbenzenes: 2 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH2CH3. This leaves 6 - 2 = 4 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 2 * (2+3) = 10. Total = 4 + 10 = 14.\n    *   The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. This immediately rules out **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet (for the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (for the -CH3 groups) due to spin-spin coupling. This eliminates option C.\n    *   So, both compounds must be tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each molecule has 2 aromatic protons and 12 alkyl (methyl) protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24 protons.\n    *   The ratio of the three singlets is 2:1:1. Let the integration of the smallest peak be 'x'. Then the integrations are 2x, x, and x.\n    *   The total integration is 2x + x + x = 4x.\n    *   So, 4x = 24 protons, which means x = 6 protons.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the alkyl region must integrate to **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Candidate**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each tetramethylbenzene isomer, focusing on the number and integration of signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. They produce **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry (or, under some conditions, a plane of symmetry leading to a different prediction, but we will see this compound is ruled out by the aromatic signal count). The most rigorous analysis shows different environments for the protons and methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They would produce **two separate singlets**, each for **1H**. This contradicts the requirement for a compound that gives a *single* aromatic signal. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture, as its presence would lead to at least three signals in the aromatic region. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Mixture**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** matches all the data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The intensity ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one singlet corresponding to **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives two singlets, each corresponding to **6H**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds must have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's check this for all options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6 carbons in the ring + 4 methyl carbons = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens on the ring + 4 * 3 hydrogens on methyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6 carbons in the ring + 2 * 2 carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + 2 * 5 hydrogens on ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14.\n        *   All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This implies we are mixing two compounds, let's call them Compound X and Compound Y.\n        *   Each compound must produce a single peak (a singlet) for all its aromatic protons. This happens when all aromatic protons in a molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of aromatic protons in Compound X is equal to the number of aromatic protons in Compound Y (since the molar ratio of X:Y is 1:1).\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This combined signal arises from the alkyl protons of both compounds.\n        *   The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling for these alkyl groups. This is true for methyl (CH3) groups attached to an aromatic ring, but not for ethyl (CH2CH3) groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet).\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups at C1, C2, C4, and C5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H), {C2-Me} is unique (3H), and {C5-Me} is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or **2:1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C4-Me} are equivalent (6H), and {C2-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or **1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four protons at C2, C3, C5, and C6 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3 that are not equivalent and will couple with each other. This will produce **one quartet** (4H total) for the CH2 groups and **one triplet** (6H total) for the CH3 groups.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n    *   First, we can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene. Its spectrum shows a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, but the problem states there are only singlets. Furthermore, it has 4 aromatic protons, while the other candidates have 2. A 1:1 mixture with a tetramethylbenzene isomer would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 ratio for the aromatic signals, not the observed 1:1 ratio. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n    *   We are now left with combinations of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. All of them give a single singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, so any 1:1 mixture of two different ones will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This part of the data fits options A, B, and D. We must use the alkyl region data to distinguish between them.\n\n    *   **Let's check the alkyl signals for the remaining options:**\n\n        *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 2 = **three singlets**.\n            *   Integration ratio: 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n            *   **This matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n        *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 2 + 3 = up to five singlets. This contradicts the observation of only three signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H peaks, we would get four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which is not what is observed.\n\n        *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 3 = **four singlets**. This contradicts the observation of only three signals.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the mixture described in Option A produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum that matches the data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their splitting patterns (multiplicity), and their relative integrations.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H singlet, one 12H singlet).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They are not adjacent to other protons, giving one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three separate **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 4 signals total (one 2H singlet, three aliphatic singlets with 6H, 3H, and 3H integrations).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent, giving a second **singlet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H singlet, two 6H singlets).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups produce:\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (split by the CH3).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (split by the CH2).\n    *   The problem states all signals are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (A, C, D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Key Data Points for the Mixture:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio. The total aliphatic protons from a 1:1 mixture are 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the signals must integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively.\n\n**Let's test Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and a 12H aliphatic singlet.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and two 6H aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:** We have one 2H singlet from the first compound and one 2H singlet from the second. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, this results in **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals arise from 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** We have one 12H singlet from the first compound and two separate 6H singlets from the second compound. Assuming these three signals are all resolved (have different chemical shifts), the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the data perfectly.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the spectrum without needing to assume any unusual overlaps (accidental degeneracies).\n\n**Why other options are less likely:**\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aliphatic signals would be one 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This would result in four aliphatic signals unless two signals happened to have the exact same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy). To get the 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from Isodurene would need to be degenerate, which is possible but less straightforward than the explanation provided by option D.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This combination would give two 6H singlets from the first compound and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the second. This would result in up to five aliphatic signals. To achieve the observed spectrum, it would require multiple, unlikely accidental degeneracies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that directly predicts an NMR spectrum with two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H (4 x 3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A proper analysis shows the following equivalences:\n        *   Protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two equivalent protons (H4, H6) will give one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. This will result in three **singlets**.\n        *   Singlet 1: C1-CH3 and C3-CH3 (equivalent). Integration: 6H.\n        *   Singlet 2: C2-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n        *   Singlet 3: C5-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. It matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. Ethyl groups show a characteristic quartet (for the CH2) and triplet (for the CH3) pattern due to spin-spin splitting. They do not produce singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the experimental spectrum only shows singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the mixture based on the predictions:**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture. This means we add the spectra of two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet of integration 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different, which is expected), each corresponding to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H = 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio means the total integration (2+1+1=4 parts) is divided into signals with relative sizes of 2/4, 1/4, and 1/4.\n    *   Absolute integrations: (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**4. Test the remaining options:**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would result in at least 4 signals (if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, and two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data from the spectrum without requiring any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H singlets. This is four signals. To get three signals with the correct 12H, 6H, 6H integrations, the two 3H signals must accidentally have the exact same chemical shift (accidental isochrony) to appear as one 6H signal. While possible, the combination in option C explains the data directly and is therefore the much more likely answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed 1H NMR spectrum, which shows two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals in both the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) and the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm). The signals are all described as singlets, which is a crucial clue about the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecules.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three distinct singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, producing a pair of **doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets, **Prehnitene can be eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Elimination**\n\n*   Options B and C include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), which is incorrect because it would produce doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   Option A includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect because it would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n\nBy this process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n**4. Verify the Spectrum of the Mixture in Option D**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene matches the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        *   The second 6H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. For 4 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **2H and 2H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The first 2H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The second 2H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to Option D. Verifying the combined spectrum of this mixture shows that it is fully consistent with the observed data, assuming two plausible instances of accidental signal overlap, a common phenomenon in NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Options:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n2.  **Verify Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6C (ring) + 4C (methyls) = 10C. 2H (ring) + 12H (methyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is correct for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6C (ring) + 4C (ethyls) = 10C. 4H (ring) + 10H (ethyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is also correct.\n    All four compounds are isomers and fit the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound:**\n    This analysis focuses on symmetry to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent. This will produce a single **singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet contradicts the data, which states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent, but because they are coupled to each other (and to the methyl groups differently), they are magnetically non-equivalent. This will lead to splitting. The signal will appear as an **AB quartet or a pair of doublets**, not as singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a non-singlet signal in the aromatic region contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates options **A** and **D**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Option:**\n    By elimination, the only remaining possibility is option **B**, which is a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two equivalent protons (H-3, H-6). This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl:** Four equivalent methyl groups. This gives **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two non-equivalent protons (H-4 and H-6). They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups based on their environment. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the group at C2 is unique, and the group at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (which is a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture (Durene + Isodurene):**\n    Now, we combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see if it matches the experimental data, allowing for potential accidental overlaps of signals with very similar chemical shifts.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets.\n        *   **Observation:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H (from Durene) + (1H + 1H) (from Isodurene) = 4H. For two signals to have a 1:1 ratio, each must integrate to 2H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 is the 2H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 is a single 2H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Observation:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of alkyl protons is 12H (Durene) + (6H + 3H + 3H) (Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals must have integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 (relative intensity 2) is the 12H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 (relative intensity 1) is the 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n            *   Signal 3 (relative intensity 1) is a 6H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 3H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe process of elimination definitively rules out options A, C, and D. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the information given in the 1H NMR spectrum, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe task is to identify the two compounds from the given options that would produce this combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to the high symmetry, they give a single signal, which is a **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They give a **single singlet** (no adjacent protons) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, they are magnetically equivalent due to symmetry and thus appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals will not be singlets. The two equivalent CH2 groups will be a **quartet**, and the two equivalent CH3 groups will be a **triplet**. The problem statement specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound can be ruled out from any potential mixture.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **5 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As determined earlier, 1,4-diethylbenzene produces quartets and triplets, which contradicts the given data. (Does not match)\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H+6H) -> This combines to **3 singlets** in total. The integration ratio would be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet) + Isodurene (3 singlets) -> **4 total singlets**. (Does not match)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose 1:1 mixture is consistent with all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Data from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of the two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most restrictive pieces of information are that **all observed signals are singlets** and the specific integration patterns.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options provided.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. In principle, they should produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H. However, accidental equivalence (where signals overlap by chance) is very common for similar methyl groups, so we might observe fewer than four signals. Based on spectral databases (like SDBS), it often shows three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing an AB quartet or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14.

The CH2 group will be a **quartet**, and the CH3 group will be a **triplet**. These are not singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\n*   Options containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (B and D) are incorrect because this compound would show multiplets (not singlets) in the aromatic region.\n*   The option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** (A) is incorrect because this compound would show a quartet and a triplet (not singlets) in the alkyl region.\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only **Option C** as the possible answer.\n\n**4. Verify Option C**\n\nLet's confirm if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1 mole of 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1 mole of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Total aromatic protons = 2H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 4H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (2H):** The single singlet from the two equivalent protons of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   **Signal 2 (2H):** The two different 1H protons from 1,2,3,5-TMB must be *accidentally equivalent* (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single singlet with an integration of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, this corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** The single singlet from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   The remaining signals (6H and 6H) must come from the 12 protons of the four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-TMB.

Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A singlet indicates that the aromatic protons have no adjacent (or vicinal) proton neighbors.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet. For example, this could be a 2H singlet from Compound A and a 2H singlet from Compound B.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   Singlets in this region are characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring that have no protons on adjacent carbons of the ring.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in one molecule of tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4) is 4 * 3 = 12 protons. Since we have a 1:1 mixture, the spectrum represents a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons corresponding to each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the three alkyl singlets must correspond to groups of 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integrations for each compound listed in the options. All options have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are also equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1, C3}, {C2}, and {C5}. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: {C1, C4} and {C2, C3}. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   The alkyl protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (4H), and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (6H). The presence of non-singlet signals in the alkyl region immediately eliminates this compound as a possibility, as the problem states all three alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Combinations from the Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the observed data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: The spectrum would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contradicts the \"all singlets\" description. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   The mixture shows **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet for 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n        *   The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Candidate Structures**\nAll four options have the molecular formula C10H14, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data of the 1:1 Mixture**\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nTo solve this, we must first predict the number of signals, multiplicity, and relative integrals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce a **single 4H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups have -CH2- and -CH3- protons. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because it would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, but the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has high symmetry with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (12 protons total) are equivalent. They will produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes positions 1 and 4 equivalent, 2 and 3 equivalent, and 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence often leads to the collapse of the expected doublet into a **single 2H singlet** (a common feature for this specific molecule).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two 6H singlets**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 equivalent. This will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at position 2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at position 5 is also unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with integrals of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, which is a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options for the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's test which 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) would produce the observed spectrum. The total number of alkyl protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12H + 12H = 24H. The observed 2:1:1 ratio must be applied to this total.\n*   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n*   Integral of the signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n\nSo, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined alkyl signals produce three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options again. We can exclude any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a total of **four signals** with integrals 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H (assuming no overlap). This does not match the data \"three signals\".\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> This produces **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals come from 2 protons, the integral ratio will be **1:1**. This fits the data perfectly.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Durene gives **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene gives **two 6H singlets**. Combining these gives exactly **three signals** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also fits the data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a minimum of 3 signals (if all 6H peaks overlap) of 18H, 3H, 3H, a ratio of 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture share the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options. We need to analyze their structures for chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. However, within an ethyl group, the -CH2- and -CH3 protons are different and they split each other. We would expect a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because the problem states the aliphatic signals are *all singlets*. We can eliminate any answer choice containing it (Option D).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h). The molecule has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a mirror plane that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (a pair). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent (a second pair). This produces **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Experimental data shows this molecule does not behave as if it's perfectly symmetrical on the NMR timescale, likely due to steric hindrance preventing free rotation of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This produces **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups fall into three distinct environments, producing **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A single molecule of this compound would produce two aromatic signals. The problem states the *mixture* produces two aromatic signals. If this compound were part of the mixture, it would likely result in more than two aromatic signals in total, or a ratio other than 1:1. Therefore, it's unlikely to be in the mixture.\n\n**3. Test the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that each contribute *one* aromatic singlet. This rules out 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and thus options A, B, and D. Option C is the only remaining possibility. Let's confirm it's correct.\n\n**Test Option C: A 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   Since they are different molecules, their singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is **two singlets**.\n    *   Because the mixture is 1:1 and both signals represent 2H, their integral ratio will be **1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum will therefore have a total of **three singlets**.\n    *   The integrals of these three singlets will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This also perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that perfectly reproduces the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nThis problem requires us to determine which two compounds from the given options are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (except for potentially some aromatic coupling which is absent here) points towards isomers of tetramethylbenzene or other highly symmetric structures. The presence of quartets and triplets would indicate ethyl groups, which is not observed.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds:**\n\nWe need to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). Integral: 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integral: 12H.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as two separate **singlets**. Integral: 1H each.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integral: 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This results in two **singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving a single **singlet**. Integral: 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The molecule has ethyl groups. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet**.\n    *   **Summary (1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n    *   This compound can be immediately **eliminated** because the experimental spectrum only contains singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the described spectrum. Let's test the combinations.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Let's assume a 1:1 mixture.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (2H). Prehnitene contributes another singlet (2H). If these two signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrals will be 2H and 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (12H). Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each). If all three of these signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **three singlets**. The integral ratio would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination fully explains the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **Option C (Durene + Isodurene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n    *   **Option D (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), contradicting the observation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This is a crucial starting point.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces an aromatic signal of equal total proton integration. The fact that there are *two* signals means the signals from each compound are at different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. There are no other types of signals (like doublets, triplets, or quartets). The total spectrum is the sum of the signals from the two compounds.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each candidate compound's expected 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    We need to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and integration for each of the four options based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: It is a para-disubstituted benzene ring, which is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-).\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the experimental data, which states there are only *singlets* in the alkyl region. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14.

They appear as **one singlet** (2H). (This is an AA' system, which appears as a singlet).\n        *   Alkyl protons: Symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. These two pairs are not equivalent to each other. This results in **two singlets** (6H each).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule has no symmetry. All protons are in unique chemical environments.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are not equivalent. Each has two methyl neighbors, so they are not split. This results in **two singlets** (1H each).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups are all non-equivalent. This results in **four singlets** (3H each).\n        *   Conclusion: If this compound were present, it would by itself produce two aromatic singlets and four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the mixture's data (two aromatic singlets total, three alkyl singlets total). So this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the correct pair:**\n    From the analysis above, we have eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The only remaining possibilities are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n    *   **Predicted Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   Combined: **Two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the signals will have an integration ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Predicted Alkyl Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (each for 6H).\n        *   Combined: **Three singlets**. The relative proton integration will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that matches all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis problem requires us to identify a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers from a given list, based on their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1.

This contradicts the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 2H singlet = Two 1:1 singlets. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** [2s (6H, 6H)] + [3s (6H, 3H, 3H)] = Five signals total {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}, unless there's overlap. This contradicts the \"three signals\" data and doesn't match the 2:1:1 ratio easily.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 4H singlet = Two singlets with a 1:2 ratio. (Does not match the 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would contain non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet). (Does not match).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB. In a mixture, these will have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in **two singlets with a 1:1 ratio**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will have **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the provided 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the composition of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum. We will analyze the predicted spectrum for each possible compound and then see which combination matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nSince it is a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratios reflect the combined protons from both compounds. The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region means the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nAll four proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent by this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would show a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining three compounds would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming different chemical shifts). This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals unless there is accidental overlap. If there's one overlap to produce three signals, the ratio would be (12+6):3:3 = 18:3:3 = 6:1:1, which does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). Assuming no overlap, the mixture would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both give a 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). Without overlap, this would be five signals. To get three signals, there would need to be significant, specific overlaps. It is far less likely to produce a clean 2:1:1 ratio compared to option C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data. The two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) come from the two non-equivalent aromatic environments in the two molecules. The three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio) come from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the two distinct 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The spectral data is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Constraint:** All signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\nWe need to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Molecules**\n\nFirst, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry horizontally and vertically through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl group at C5 and the one at C2.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n    *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons will couple with the -CH3- protons, producing a **quartet** (4H). The -CH3- protons will couple with the -CH2- protons, producing a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives multiplets (quartet, triplet), not just singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining pairs and see if a 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum. The mixture is 1:1, so the total number of protons from each compound is equal.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** \"Two singlets... in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single aromatic singlet for their 2 protons. When any two are mixed, we will have two sets of 2 aromatic protons. Since they are from different molecules, their chemical environments are different, leading to two distinct singlets. The integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which is 1:1. This observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** \"Three singlets... in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   Let's check the options based on the alkyl signals they would produce in a mixture.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals for {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This would result in up to five signals, or fewer if they overlap. The problem states there are only three signals. For this to be true, significant and specific overlap must occur to yield three signals with a final 2:1:1 ratio. This is highly unlikely. The total alkyl protons are 12+12=24. A 2:1:1 ratio means signals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. Combining signals of {6, 6, 6, 3, 3} cannot produce this result. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H. This is a total of four signals (assuming no overlap) with a ratio of 4:2:1:1. This does not match the observed three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- (Durene) gives **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) gives **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n        *   The combined mixture would show three distinct singlets in the alkyl region with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description of the alkyl region.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (one 2H signal from each compound).\n*   **Alkyl:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (one 12H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 6H signals from 1,2,3,4-).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided**\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n2.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlet signals with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are around 2.2 ppm, characteristic of methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n4.  **The Candidates:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **Step 2: Check Molecular Formulas and Rule out Candidates Based on Signal Type**\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** All four compounds, the three tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2), have the molecular formula C10H14. This does not eliminate any options.\n*   **Signal Type Check:** The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are **singlets**.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. The protons of the ethyl groups (-CH2- and -CH3) would couple with each other, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Isomer**\nWe need to determine the number of signals and their relative integrations for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a single signal. Although they are adjacent, in such an A2 spin system, they produce a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second, different signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 6:6 or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\nNow we combine the spectra of the pairs in the remaining options (B, C, D) and see which one matches the experimental data for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Experimental Data Requirements:**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of methyl protons is 12 (from one molecule) + 12 (from the other) = 24H.\n    *   The ratio 2:1:1 has a total of 4 parts. So the signals must correspond to integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   We are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined methyl signals are: one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 (from one molecule) + 2 (from the other) = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio means the two signals must each integrate to **2H**.\n\n**Let's test the options:**\n\n*   **B) Durene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {12H} from Durene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene = A total of 4 signals. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **C) Prehnitene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {6H, 6H} from Prehnitene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene. The combination does not produce the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **D) Durene + Prehnitene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two separate singlets of **6H** each.\n        *   The total is three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   These two signals are from non-identical molecules, so they will likely have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in two separate signals. Each signal integrates to 2H. The ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) is the only one that perfectly reproduces all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar (1:1).\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14.

Due to spin-spin coupling, the CH2 signal will be a quartet and the CH3 signal will be a triplet.\n        *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated because the problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\n    *   Options B, C, and D can be immediately ruled out.\n        *   Options B and D include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which would show doublets, not singlets, in the aromatic region.\n        *   Option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet, not only singlets, in the alkyl region.\n\n    *   This leaves **Option A** as the only possibility. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene matches the described spectrum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture in Option A:**\n    *   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Since they are different compounds, their aromatic protons will likely have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet with a relative integration of 12H.\n        *   Isodurene contributes three singlets with relative integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   In total, we have four distinct signals from the methyl groups with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The problem states that only **three singlets** are observed with a **2:1:1 ratio**. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n        *   Let's check what kind of overlap would produce a 2:1:1 ratio. The total integration in the alkyl region corresponds to 24 protons (12 from Durene, 12 from Isodurene). A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the observed peaks are proportional to 2x, 1x, and 1x. The total is 4x. So, 4x = 24H, which means x = 6H. The observed signals must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   How can we get these from the individual signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H)?\n            *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n            *   The 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyls of Isodurene.\n            *   To get the second 6H signal, the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyls of Isodurene must have the same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy) and therefore overlap into a single peak.\n        *   This scenario results in three peaks with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both are described as **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **1:1**. This means the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three are **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **2:1:1**. This tells us the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three distinct alkyl signals.\n\n### **2. Analyze the molecular structures and predict the ¹H NMR spectra for each candidate compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h). It has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low symmetry. As confirmed by spectral databases, there are distinct environments for its protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This gives **two signals**. They are meta-coupled, which is a very small coupling, so they appear as **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Experimental data shows there are three distinct signals due to accidental chemical shift equivalence of two methyl groups. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** One mirror plane.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. These protons are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so technically they should form a doublet or an AB quartet. However, it's a single signal representing **2H**. For this problem, we'll consider it \"one signal\".\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two signals**. Both are **singlets** with integrations of **6H and 6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic signal (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Four equivalent protons, giving **one signal (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups give a **quartet (4H)** for the CH₂ groups and a **triplet (6H)** for the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be **eliminated immediately** because its alkyl spectrum contains a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. This eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the remaining combinations for a 1:1 mixture**\n\nNow, we check the remaining options by \"adding\" the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (2 signals, 6H each) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 5 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   Total: **2 signals**. The integral ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Alkyl:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 2 signals, each for 6H.\n    *   Total: **3 signals**. The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H. Dividing by the smallest value (6H), we get a ratio of **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option perfectly matches all aspects of the provided NMR data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (1 signal, 12H) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 4 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only combination that fits the experimental data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that each compound has aromatic protons.\n    *   The protons within each molecule must be chemically equivalent to each other to appear as a single singlet.\n    *   The two compounds are different, so their aromatic singlets appear at slightly different chemical shifts.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds and tells us that each compound contributes the same number of aromatic protons to its respective signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals being singlets indicates that the protons are not coupled to any neighboring non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a quaternary carbon, like on an aromatic ring.\n    *   We need to find a combination of two compounds that, when mixed 1:1, will produce three methyl signals in this specific 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and predict the 1H NMR spectra for each option:**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow let's predict the spectrum for each compound, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. However, the ethyl groups would show coupling. We would expect a triplet for the -CH3 protons and a quartet for the -CH2- protons. Since the problem states all signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.** This also eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the plane of symmetry). The methyl group at C5 is also unique (on the plane of symmetry). This gives **three aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 3H, one for 3H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixture options:**\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, matches the observed spectrum. We already confirmed that any 1:1 pair of the three tetramethylbenzenes will give two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio, as they each have one 2H aromatic singlet. The key is to match the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This would produce **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This produces **three** aliphatic singlets, with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: Even with a coincidental overlap of one 6H signal from each compound, this would result in four signals with integrations (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds. Let's break down the spectral information:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are equal in number.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This tells us there are three distinct types of methyl protons, and their relative abundance is 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbon atoms for any of these alkyl groups (which is expected for methyl groups attached to a benzene ring).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its individual 1H NMR spectrum. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: (the inner ones at C2 and C3) and (the outer ones at C1 and C4). This results in **two singlets**, each representing 6 hydrogens (6H). Their integration ratio would be 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two different singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are, in principle, chemically non-equivalent. However, accidental equivalence is common. The spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This fits.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons on the ethyl groups will be split by their neighbors. The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. The problem states that all alkyl signals are *singlets*, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### **3. Test the Combinations in a 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (options B, C, and D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the mixture.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   **Result:** Two singlets. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals correspond to 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets in total. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n    *   This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Prehnitene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Verify the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all the proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding four methyl groups (CH3) and removing four hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-4) + C4H(4*3) = C6H2 + C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding two ethyl groups (C2H5) and removing two hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-2) + C4H(2*5) = C6H4 + C4H10 = **C10H14**. This compound also fits the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number and type of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (para substitution).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons (at positions 2, 3, 5, 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the two methylene (-CH2-) protons are split by the three methyl (-CH3) protons, resulting in a **quartet** (4H total). The three methyl protons are split by the two methylene protons, resulting in a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since the experimental spectrum shows only singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (possesses a center of inversion and two mirror planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H). (Although they are ortho-coupled, in such a symmetrical environment, they often appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. This produces **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique and lie on the axis of symmetry, making them inequivalent to each other and to the other methyls. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 singlets in total.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nThe experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options (A, B, C).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two of these will result in two aromatic singlets (assuming different chemical shifts), each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to 1:1. Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any combination of these three isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check (The Deciding Factor):** We need to find a combination of alkyl signals that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 relative integration. For a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio on an integral of 24 means the actual proton counts for the three signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    So we are looking for a combination that produces three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    Let's combine the predicted alkyl signals for each pair:\n\n    *   **A) Prehnitene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Prehnitene: Two singlets (6H, 6H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This would give between 3 to 5 signals depending on overlaps, but the integrals (6, 6, 6, 3, 3) cannot be combined to give (12, 6, 6). So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Durene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Durene: One singlet (12H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This gives four singlets with integrals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This is not three signals. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Durene + Prehnitene:**\n        *   Durene: **One singlet (12H)**\n        *   Prehnitene: **Two singlets (6H, 6H)**\n        *   Combined: This mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons producing these signals have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The signals are in a **1:1 ratio**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (around 2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates they are from methyl (-CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (e.g., attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   The signals are in a **2:1:1 ratio**, based on their integration (the area under the peak).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine how many unique proton environments exist.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There's a horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry. In theory, all positions are unique. However, due to accidental overlap of signals (as confirmed by spectral databases), a simplified spectrum is observed.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** While there are four methyl groups, two of them are accidentally equivalent in chemical shift. This results in **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H** (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**. (Although adjacent, their equivalence means they don't split each other).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups produce a **quartet** (from the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (from the -CH3-). They are not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations based on the options to see which mixture produces the observed spectrum. We are looking for a mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** (1 singlet from the first) + (3 singlets from the second) = **4 total alkyl singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two singlets**. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, the integral ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three singlets**. The integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **This option perfectly explains the entire spectrum.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have all singlet alkyl signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is an analysis of the provided information to determine the most consistent answer.\n\n### **1. Breakdown of the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem describes the ¹H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlet signals with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound likely produces one aromatic singlet, and both singlets represent the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlet signals with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals being singlets strongly suggests the alkyl groups are methyls that do not experience proton-proton coupling. This observation rules out isomers with ethyl groups, which would show multiplets (quartets and triplets).\n    *   For tetramethylbenzene isomers (C₁₀H₁₄), each molecule has 12 methyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there is a total of 24 methyl protons.\n    *   Applying the 2:1:1 ratio to 24 protons:\n        *   Total parts in ratio = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n        *   Protons per part = 24 / 4 = 6H\n        *   The three signals must therefore have integrations corresponding to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Prediction of Individual Spectra**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each candidate compound based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound is ruled out. Its ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets. This eliminates any answer containing it.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Highly symmetric, giving **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Highly symmetric, giving **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Symmetric, giving **one 2H singlet**. (Adjacent equivalent protons appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Two sets of equivalent methyls (C1/C4 and C2/C3) give **two 6H singlets**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   A significant point of confusion in NMR prediction. Some sources predict two 1H aromatic singlets (due to no symmetry), while others predict one 2H aromatic singlet (due to simplified symmetry).\n    *   If it has two 1H aromatic singlets, mixing it with Durene or Prehnitene would give three aromatic signals total, which contradicts the data. This interpretation rules out any mixture containing Isodurene.\n    *   If it has one 2H aromatic singlet, the decision rests on the alkyl signals. The alkyl spectrum consists of three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Possible Mixtures**\n\nWe are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined spectra give two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (integrating to 12H, 6H, 6H).\n\nLet's test the most plausible combination: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **two singlets** at different chemical shifts. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Alkyl Spectrum:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion on Consistency**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option B)** provides a direct and unambiguous explanation for all the spectral data without requiring any assumptions about coincidental signal overlap. A review of the provided candidate answers shows that while the final output letter varies due to inconsistencies, the overwhelming majority of the reasoning sections correctly identifies this pair as the only one that fits the data. The reasoning for this combination is therefore the most consistent element across the provided solutions.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analyze the requirements from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio). Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute a signal (or signals) for its aromatic protons, and the total number of protons represented by each of the two final singlets must be equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. All signals are singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbons (e.g., no ethyl or propyl groups). This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.

They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets** (each integrating to 3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. Since they are equivalent and adjacent, they behave as a single group and produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H, for a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will show a **quartet** (CH2, 4H) and a **triplet** (CH3, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 alkyl quartet, 1 alkyl triplet.

Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nLet's test the combination in each option to see if it matches the observed spectrum (2 aromatic singlets in 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and triplet.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H).

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **12H:6H:6H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each).

It has a center of inversion and two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They are in different chemical environments and are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). Therefore, they will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry. This gives one **singlet** integrating to **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.

(Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: There are two protons at C4 and C6. These are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is between a methyl and a hydrogen). They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as a **multiplet** (specifically, an AB quartet or a pair of doublets), not a singlet. This is a key point.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This would give two singlets of 6H each.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signals will be a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n**3. Use a Process of Elimination based on the Spectral Data**\n\nWe can now eliminate options based on the characteristics of the mixture's spectrum.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are \"all singlets\". **1,4-diethylbenzene** produces a quartet and a triplet. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The problem states that the aromatic signals are \"two singlets\". **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** has two adjacent aromatic protons, which would result in a multiplet, not a singlet. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is incorrect.\n    *   This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.\n\n**4. Confirm the Remaining Option**\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can produce the described spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states the mixture has \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\". In a 1:1 mixture of these two isomers, the total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4H. A 1:1 ratio means each signal must integrate to 2H. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally isochronous\" (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single 2H singlet. The mixture would then show two 2H singlets (one from each compound), which perfectly matches the 1:1 ratio description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"three signals ... in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This perfectly describes the spectrum of pure **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   What about the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB? For the final spectrum of the mixture to have three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's check the total integration. Total aliphatic protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from the components:\n        *   Signal 1 (12H): This comes directly from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 2 (6H): This comes from the 6H singlet of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        *   Signal 3 (6H): This must be formed by the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB being accidentally isochronous and overlapping.\n    *   This explanation, while requiring two separate instances of accidental signal overlap, is the only one that logically fits all the data provided. Such simplifications are common in spectroscopy problems.\n\nThe process of elimination is the most straightforward path to the solution. The compounds that do not produce singlets in the specified regions can be immediately ruled out, leaving only one possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates a lack of adjacent, non-equivalent protons that would cause spin-spin splitting.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of methyl groups. They will produce **two alkyl singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two aromatic singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. One might expect four separate alkyl singlets. However, due to very similar electronic environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will produce **one aromatic singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a quartet and the -CH3 group will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Described in Each Option**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Combined, this would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and alkyl regions is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, 1,2,3,4-):** A benzene ring (C6) with 4 methyl groups (4 x CH3) and 2 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** A benzene ring (C6) with 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) and 4 hydrogens on the ring. The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = **C10H14**. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to predict the number of signals, multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and integration for the protons in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are not all equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl at 2 is unique.\n        *   Methyl at 5 is unique.\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent.\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The CH2 (methylene) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the 3 adjacent CH3 protons). Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The CH3 (methyl) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the 2 adjacent CH2 protons). Integration: **6H**.\n    *   Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from consideration.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectra of the Possible Mixtures:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's test the combination from option D, which involves the two compounds that seem most promising.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option D):**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine their spectra for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 2H) and one singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 2H). Assuming they appear at slightly different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We get one singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H) and two singlets from Compound 2 (relative intensities 6H and 6H). This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only one that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the question for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All the options given (tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene) have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14.\n2.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The presence of two signals means there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, the simplest explanation is that Compound A gives one aromatic singlet and Compound B gives another aromatic singlet at a slightly different chemical shift.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same. For tetramethylbenzenes, there are two aromatic protons (C6H2(CH3)4), so each compound would contribute a 2H singlet. This fits the data perfectly.\n3.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups.\n    *   This is the spectrum of the *entire mixture*. Since we have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds, each having 12 non-aromatic protons, the total integration in this region corresponds to 24 protons.\n    *   Let's calculate the number of protons for each signal based on the 2:1:1 ratio:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H.\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum must show three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the given compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The molecule has ethyl groups. Due to spin-spin coupling between the CH2 and CH3 protons, the spectrum will show a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately because the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the observed spectrum:\n*   Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations 12H, 6H, and 6H (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nLet's test the pairs given in the options. We are looking for a combination whose individual aliphatic signals add up to {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: This would give a minimum of three signals {6H+6H, 3H, 3H} = {12H, 3H, 3H} if one set of 6H peaks overlaps. This does not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene signals: {12H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: The set of signals would be {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three, and the integrations do not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene signals: **{12H}**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **{6H, 6H}**\n    *   Combined: If we add these signals together, we get exactly the required set of three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's check the aromatic region for this pair. Durene gives one 2H singlet, and Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires us to determine which two compounds, from a given list, are present in a 1:1 mixture based on its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (splitting pattern), and their relative integration. All alkyl groups are methyls except for 1,4-diethylbenzene, so we expect singlets for the tetramethylbenzenes.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry between C1-C2 and C4-C5, and another between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will produce a single signal. This will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they will be **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection across the symmetry plane (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce a single signal. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence results in a **singlet** (or a complex pattern that looks like a singlet) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   These two sets are in different environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**, giving a **1:1** ratio.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the CH2 group are adjacent to the three protons of the CH3 group, so they will be split into a quartet. The protons of the CH3 group are adjacent to the two protons of the CH2 group, so they will be split into a triplet. The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture for Each Option**\n\nNow let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show four singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, assuming they have different chemical shifts, this will result in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H = **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. In a mixture, this will result in **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show up to five singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nSince the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally to the total number of protons observed.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each of the four possible compounds to predict their individual 1H NMR spectra. All have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is between a methyl group and another hydrogen's previous position (C6 is between C1-Me and C5-Me). They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because of the symmetry (they are magnetically equivalent), they do not split each other. They will produce a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (from the 2x -CH2- groups, 4H total) and a **triplet** (from the 2x -CH3 groups, 6H total).\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of the compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals that are not all singlets (a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (unless there's accidental overlap, which is a less likely scenario to assume). This contradicts the \"two signals, 1:1 ratio\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each). This would also result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal (2H from Durene vs. 2H from Prehnitene). This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   This gives a total of **three singlets**. The integral ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture spectrum is consistent with all the provided data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given spectral data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals (singlets) around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets indicates that there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound**\n\nAll four candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C4, and C5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a singlet integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce one singlet integrating to 6H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent by symmetry. They will produce a second, distinct singlet integrating to 6H.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (6H each)\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way the others do.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen) are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals, two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, C5) are in unique chemical environments. We would expect four distinct singlets, each integrating to 3H. (Note: Sometimes, accidental overlap can reduce the number of observed signals, but based on pure symmetry, we expect four).\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:**\n        *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1H each)\n        *   Aliphatic: 4 singlets (3H each)\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite (para) positions.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would show characteristic coupling. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet, and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet. The problem states that all signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option A.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options based on a 1:1 mixture**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in the remaining options.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three** singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Since these are different compounds, their aromatic signals will likely have different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H, giving an integral ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming no accidental overlap). The integral ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum matching the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the NMR data tells us about the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   **Two signals:** This means there are two chemically non-equivalent types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **Singlets:** This means that these aromatic protons are not adjacent to any other protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1:1 ratio:** In a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   **Three signals:** There are three chemically non-equivalent types of aliphatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   **All singlets:** This indicates that these protons are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons they can couple with (e.g., they are attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon). This rules out ethyl groups which would show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **2:1:1 ratio:** This describes the relative number of protons for each of the three signals. Since both molecules are C10H14 tetramethylbenzenes, the total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first molecule) + 12 (from the second molecule) = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio on 24 protons corresponds to signals with integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 12 protons\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24 = 6 protons\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination that produces three methyl signals with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Spectra of Individual Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The aliphatic region would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This would theoretically produce four different singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (very similar chemical shifts), the spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures (The Options)**\n\nNow let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** One 12H singlet + three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives a total of four signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives multiplets, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since both signals arise from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Aliphatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Assuming the three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) + two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed NMR data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Options:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula (C10H14) for each option and predict its 1H NMR spectrum based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4 (ring) + 2 * C2H5 (ethyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectrum:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet (4H). The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3- protons. This will produce a quartet (4H total) and a triplet (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not give only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry runs horizontally and vertically through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment than the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule lacks the high symmetry of the other isomers. All four methyl groups and both aromatic protons are in chemically unique environments (Point Group C1).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are non-equivalent and not coupled to each other. This should result in **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are non-equivalent. This should result in **four singlets**, each integrating to **3H** (though accidental overlap could reduce this number, as seen in databases).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), up to 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,4-, and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) produces the described spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. The combination would result in up to three signals, or two signals with a 3:1 ratio if there's overlap. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals (assuming they have different chemical shifts) would appear as **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination of these gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. This combination would result in up to three signals or two signals with a 3:1 ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose combined 1H NMR spectrum matches the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for all compounds is given as C10H14. Let's verify this for the four options.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is also correct for 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The key information is from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound to see how they would combine in a mixture. We are looking for the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration (number of protons).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets correspond to the same number of protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The signals are all singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling for the alkyl groups. This rules out any ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. Therefore, option **A) is incorrect**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons (methyl groups) in a 1:1 mixture of any two tetramethylbenzenes is 12 + 12 = 24 protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratios is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, produce three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**3. Predict the Spectra for the Remaining Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. We use symmetry to determine chemical equivalence.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, the coupling is often not resolved for such symmetrical systems, leading to **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This produces **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we test the combinations in options B, C, and D to see which one produces the observed spectrum {Aromatic: two 1:1 singlets; Alkyl: three singlets with 12H, 6H, 6H integration}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals unless there is overlap. No combination of these produces the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {12H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals. To get three signals, we would have to assume the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift. This would result in signals of {12H, 6H, 6H}, matching the required pattern. However, this relies on an assumption of accidental equivalence between chemically different methyl groups (one is between two methyls, the other is between two hydrogens), which is less likely than a solution that requires no such assumptions.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n        *   Combined signals in the mixture: **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the NMR spectrum directly, without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all proposed tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct.\n*   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is correct.\n\nNext, we predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. These two sets are not equivalent to each other. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon C5, which has a methyl) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** Detailed analysis (or looking up reference spectra) shows three sets of equivalent protons. Two methyl groups are accidentally equivalent. This results in **three singlets** with an integration of 6H:3H:3H (or a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons will show splitting. The -CH2- group will be a **quartet** and the -CH3 group will be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets in the alkyl region, so we can immediately eliminate this compound and **Option D**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A, B, C)**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Total Aromatic Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 2 (from compound 1) + 2 (from compound 2) = 4H. The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. This means the signals must correspond to 2H and 2H.\n*   **Total Methyl Protons** in the 1:1 mixture = 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24H. The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H (since 12 + 6 + 6 = 24, and 12:6:6 = 2:1:1).\n\nLet's test the remaining options against these requirements.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This would give three signals (2H:1H:1H) unless the two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5- accidentally overlap perfectly to give a 2H signal. This is possible but relies on coincidence.\n    *   Alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from 1,2,3,4-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives a total of five signals. To get the required three signals (12H, 6H, 6H) would require multiple, complex overlaps. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-). This again gives three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 1H signals.\n    *   Alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-). This gives four signals. It could be reduced to three if the two 3H signals overlap, but the resulting integrations would be 12H, 6H, 6H (a 2:1:1 ratio). This fits the alkyl region but relies on two separate coincidental overlaps (one in the aromatic, one in the alkyl).\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, these two non-equivalent compounds will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H. The ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. Combining these gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data without requiring any coincidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Check the molecular formula of the options:**\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (TMB):** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 4 hydrogens with 4 methyl (CH3) groups gives C6H2(CH3)4, which simplifies to C10H14. All three TMB isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) have the correct formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Benzene is C6H6. Replacing 2 hydrogens with 2 ethyl (C2H5) groups gives C6H4(C2H5)2, which simplifies to C10H14. This also has the correct formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\nThe key is to use molecular symmetry to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons, which corresponds to the number of signals.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, and the four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The ethyl group would produce a **quartet** (for the CH2) and a **triplet** (for the CH3) due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The problem states all signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, coupling between equivalent protons is not observed, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   Therefore, there are **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, corresponding to a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Analyze the mixture based on the individual spectra:**\n\nWe need a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two 1:1 singlets. Since each of the three TMB isomers gives one aromatic singlet (2H), a 1:1 mixture of any two will give two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This condition is met by options A, B, and C.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the three peaks correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This does not match the required three signals with a 12H:6H:6H integration.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined signals: This gives a total of exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: This would naturally produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). To get the observed three signals, it would require an accidental overlap (identical chemical shift) of two non-equivalent signals. While not impossible, the scenario in option B provides a direct and unambiguous explanation without requiring such a coincidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that naturally produces the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent.

However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so they will couple and split each other's signals. This will result in a **multiplet (an AB quartet or a pair of doublets)**, not a singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H total), and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H total).

Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis (Two singlets, 1:1 ratio):**\n    *   The mixture must contain two compounds that *each* produce an aromatic singlet.

If mixed with 1,2,4,5-TMB (2H singlet) or 1,2,3,5-TMB (2H singlet), the aromatic signal ratio would be 4H:2H or 2:1, not 1:1. So, option D is incorrect.\n    *   The only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which has a 2H aromatic singlet) and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which also has a 2H aromatic singlet). In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets would have a 1:1 integration ratio, perfectly matching the data. This points directly to option C.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis (Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio):**\n    *   Let's confirm that Option C also explains the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides one singlet of 12H intensity.\n    *   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-TMB):** Provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n    *   The problem states that a total of only **three** aliphatic singlets are observed in the mixture. This implies an *accidental overlap* of signals.\n    *   Let's assume there is an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This is a common occurrence. These two signals would merge into a single signal with an intensity of 6H.\n    *   So, the signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        3.  The combined 6H (3H + 3H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n    *   This gives three total aliphatic signals with an integration of 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1.

Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique and lie on the symmetry plane. This results in three distinct sets of methyl protons. They will produce **three singlets** with integrations of **6H** (for Me-1 and Me-3), **3H** (for Me-2), and **3H** (for Me-5). The integration ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** with integrations of **6H** (for Me-1,4) and **6H** (for Me-2,3).

This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **(Match)**\n*   This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in four distinct alkyl singlets. **(Mismatch)**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. Even with a potential overlap of one of the 6H signals, this would result in at least four signals (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), not three. **(Mismatch)**\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem requires analyzing the 1H NMR spectra of several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and one isomer of diethylbenzene to determine which two are present in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are at C5 and C6. They are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because it does not produce aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3) will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates:**\nThe only two compounds that fit the \"singlets only\" criteria are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Since the two compounds are different, their aromatic protons will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is two singlets. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H).\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed in the alkyl region. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The total number of parts in the ratio is 2+1+1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's match these required integrals (12H, 6H, 6H) with the signals from our two compounds:\n        *   The 12H signal comes from the single methyl signal of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The 6H signal comes from the equivalent C1/C3 methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The remaining 6H signal must come from the overlap of the two 3H signals (from C2 and C5 methyls) of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. While the C2 and C5 methyls are not equivalent by symmetry, it is common for signals with similar chemical environments to overlap accidentally. *Correction*: In the spectrum of the mixture, this 6H signal could also arise from an overlap of a signal from one compound with a signal from the other. However, the most straightforward explanation that generates signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H from the available signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) is the one described. The key is that the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone (6H, 3H, 3H) have the same ratio (2:1:1) as the observed signals in the mixture, but the presence of the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene alters the overall integration. The given 2:1:1 ratio refers to the final combined spectrum, which must integrate to 12H:6H:6H.\n    *   The combination of signals from these two compounds is the only one that can produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two compounds in the mixture must be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 1s (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. This would ideally give four separate singlets. However, due to similar environments, some signals may overlap. A common pattern observed is three signals: one for the two most similar methyls (e.g., at C1 and C3) and two separate signals for the others, resulting in signals with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1). For our analysis, we will note it produces more than 2 aliphatic signals.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 2s (1H, 1H); Aliphatic: 3 or 4 singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 2s (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving **one singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. We would expect a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be ruled out because its aliphatic signals are not singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of compounds, this means each compound must contribute an equal number of protons to a signal. The simplest way this occurs is if each compound produces one singlet corresponding to 2H.\n    *   Durene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Prehnitene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Isodurene: No (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   This strongly suggests the mixture must be Durene and Prehnitene.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Requirement:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the integrals of the signals are:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    We need a mixture that produces singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's check our proposed mixture: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   Assuming these three signals do not overlap, the mixture will show three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the components of a 1:1 mixture by analyzing its combined 1H NMR spectrum and comparing it to the expected spectra of four possible aromatic compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one singlet to the aromatic region, and the number of protons giving rise to each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each candidate compound:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. A horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry pass through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They are meta to each other, so any coupling would be very small, and they appear as a single **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal).\n        All methyls are attached to carbons with no protons, so all signals are **singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signal, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will be a **quartet (4H)** due to coupling with the adjacent CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will be a **triplet (6H)** due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nBy elimination, the mixture must contain **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, these will appear as **two singlets** at slightly different chemical shifts, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of their integrations will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's sum the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = **24H total**.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a **2:1:1** ratio. Let's find the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Protons per part = 24H / 4 = 6H.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n    *   Now, let's see if our two compounds can produce these signals (12H, 6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one signal: a **12H singlet**. This matches Signal 1.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three signals: a 6H singlet, a 3H singlet, and another 3H singlet.\n        *   The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB can be Signal 2.\n        *   For Signal 3 (6H), the two separate 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB must have the same chemical shift (be \"accidentally isochronous\") and overlap to appear as a single 6H singlet.\n    *   This combination perfectly accounts for the three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds, from a given list, corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nLet's analyze the molecular formula and structure of each option to predict its spectrum. All listed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons. Thus, they will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is adjacent to one methyl group, while the proton at C6 is flanked by two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct signals**. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be **singlets**, each corresponding to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the mirror plane). They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H. (While they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence in a symmetrical system simplifies the pattern to a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, similar to p-xylene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will appear as a **quartet** (split by the adjacent CH3), and the methyl (CH3) protons will appear as a **triplet** (split by the adjacent CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out immediately.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option, remembering it's a 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 2 singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** The spectrum would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB and a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. This **does not match** the data, which specifies only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which two compounds, from a list of four, are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on the provided 1H NMR spectrum data.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of two compounds. This means that for every molecule of compound X, there is one molecule of compound Y.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The integration ratio is **1:1**.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates the protons of the alkyl groups are not coupled to other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to a CH or CH2 group, or an ethyl group where coupling is not resolved or absent.\n    *   The integration ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 is unique, and the proton at position 6 is unique. They are not adjacent. This will result in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2 is unique (3H); the one at C5 is unique (3H); and the ones at C1 and C3 are equivalent to each other (6H). This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to each other, which would normally create a doublet. However, because they are chemically equivalent, they behave as a singlet in many common cases (an AA' system) or a more complex pattern. Given the simple data, it's most likely treated as a singlet for this level of problem. Assuming they appear as a singlet due to equivalence, this gives a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: those at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H), and those at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, creating a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons, creating a **triplet (6H)**. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately **ruled out**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixtures Based on the Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data. We need a combination that results in 2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. Total: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. Total: **Three singlets**. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This is invalid because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** (or two if there's accidental overlap), with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. Total: **Three singlets** with an expected integration ratio of 2:1:1. This does not match the observed two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only combination that produces an NMR spectrum consistent with the experimental data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Structure of Candidates**\nThe molecular formula C10H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4`), which corresponds to a substituted benzene ring.\nThe substituents must account for C4H8.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The four methyl groups (4 x CH3) are C4H12. This doesn't match C4H8. Let's recalculate. The benzene core is C6. The substituents are C4H14. This is consistent with four methyl groups (C4H12) on a C6H2 ring (total C10H14) or two ethyl groups (C4H10) on a C6H4 ring (total C10H14).\n\nLet's examine the 1H NMR spectrum predicted for each option based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1-Me and C3-Me are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   C5-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not a singlet. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl group protons (CH2 and CH3) are not singlets. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons into a triplet. The problem explicitly states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n### **3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\n*   The aromatic region shows two separate singlets. This means the mixture must contain two different compounds, and *each* must produce a single singlet in its aromatic spectrum.\n*   Based on our analysis in step 2, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would give doublets, and 1,4-diethylbenzene has been ruled out by the aliphatic signals.\n*   Therefore, the two compounds must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### **4. Verify the Aliphatic Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds produces the observed aliphatic spectrum.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes one singlet of 12H intensity.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n\nThe problem states the final spectrum of the mixture shows **three signals** with a ratio of **2:1:1**. This implies that some of the signals from the individual compounds overlap (are accidentally degenerate) in the mixture's spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals from the 1:1 mixture:\n1.  A singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H).\n2.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 6H).\n3.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n4.  Another singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n\nTo get only three signals, two of these must overlap. The most plausible scenario that fits the 2:1:1 ratio is if the two 3H signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** are accidentally degenerate (i.e., they have the same chemical shift).\n\nIf this overlap occurs, the signals in the mixture's spectrum would be:\n*   **Signal 1:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H (from C1/C3-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 3:** 3H + 3H = 6H (from the overlapped C2- and C5-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n\nThe integration ratio of these three signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental data provided in the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe two compounds in the 1:1 mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this.\n*   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar ratio of two of these compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies we are looking at a mixture of two compounds that have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This happens when the adjacent carbons are substituted (have no protons).\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that for each molecule of compound A, there is one molecule of compound B, and the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 1 is equal to the number of aromatic protons responsible for signal 2.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique aliphatic proton environments in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the signals are from methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to other protons. This is typical for methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" tells us the relative number of protons in each of these three environments.\n\n**2. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number and type of signals for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  CH3 at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other and will couple. This technically produces an AB quartet or a more complex multiplet. But in many cases, especially with low-resolution spectra, if the chemical shift difference is zero, it can be simplified or appear as **one singlet (2H)**. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  CH3 at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  CH3 at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets (6H, 6H)**, which is a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent and will appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 will be a quartet and the CH3 will be a triplet. Since the problem specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures Given in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's analyze the valid options.\n\n*   **Option A:** Contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is ruled out.\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals would come from Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) and Isodurene (three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H). This would give a total of up to 5 signals, which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this produces two singlets with a 1:1 ratio. (This part fits).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four aliphatic signals. This does not match the observed three signals unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene provides **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**. Prehnitene provides **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This option perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem description without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that directly accounts for all the observed signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify which pair of compounds, from the given options and in a 1:1 mixture, would produce the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals.\n    *   Both signals are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the mixture contains two types of aromatic protons that are not equivalent to each other. Each type gives a singlet, meaning its protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each singlet must arise from the same number of protons in its respective molecule.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are three signals.\n    *   All signals are singlets. This indicates the protons (likely from methyl groups) are not adjacent to any other non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Let the total number of aliphatic protons be 'N'. The three signals represent groups of protons in the ratio of (2/4)*N, (1/4)*N, and (1/4)*N.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all candidates have the molecular formula C10H14. All four are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, with the formula C6H2(CH3)4 or C6H4(C2H5)2, both of which are C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry), all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   This makes the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent.\n    *   This also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets with an integration of 6H (from Me-1 + Me-3), 3H (from Me-2), and 3H (from Me-5). The ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. Such an A2 (or more accurately, AA') system appears as a singlet.\n    *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** Two singlets, one for Me-1+Me-4 (6H) and one for Me-2+Me-3 (6H). The ratio is 6:6 or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 and CH3 protons within the ethyl group are not equivalent and will couple.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** One quartet (4H, from the -CH2-) and one triplet (6H, from the -CH3-). This does not match the data stating all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and so can option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum is the sum of the spectra of the two components. We need a combination that gives **two aromatic singlets** (1:1 ratio) and **three aliphatic singlets** (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nSince 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,5-TMB, and 1,2,3,4-TMB all produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region, any 1:1 mixture of two of these will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming slightly different chemical shifts, which is expected). So, the deciding factor will be the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's examine the aliphatic signals for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet.\n    *   Total signals: up to 5 singlets. To get the observed 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and specific signal overlap would be required. This is a complex and less likely scenario.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total signals: This combination naturally provides **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Total signals: four singlets. To match the observed spectrum, we would have to assume that the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are \"accidentally degenerate\" (have the exact same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from the overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it is an assumption.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) directly and simply explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum. It provides two 2H aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with an exact 2:1:1 integration ratio (12H:6H:6H) without needing to assume any accidental signal overlap. This is the most straightforward and chemically sound explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds:**\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n        *   Aliphatic: One singlet (12H, from 4 x CH3).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H4 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Three singlets. One for the C1/C3 methyls (6H), one for the C2 methyl (3H), and one for the C5 methyl (3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes the protons at C5 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H5 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Two singlets. One for the C1/C4 methyls (6H) and one for the C2/C3 methyls (6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. All four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (4H).\n        *   Aliphatic: The ethyl groups would show coupling. A quartet for the CH2 protons and a triplet for the CH3 protons.\n    *   The problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1 and all three candidate tetramethylbenzenes have a 2H aromatic singlet, any pair of them would produce two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This observation confirms that there are two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of methyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we need a combination of two compounds that gives one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would result in three 6H signals and two 3H signals (assuming no overlap), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets. The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would give four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that produces the observed NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nWe need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options to see which pair could produce the observed mixture spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent. This gives one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This gives a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a single plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are in different environments and will produce **two different aromatic singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent by symmetry, giving one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at 2 is unique, giving a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at 5 is unique, giving a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The alkyl protons are part of ethyl groups. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will couple to the methyl (-CH3) protons, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets. Since the problem states the alkyl signals are all singlets, this compound can be immediately eliminated. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Combinations**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the molecules are different, their singlets will have different chemical shifts. The mixture will therefore show **two aromatic singlets**. Because they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, their integrals will be equal, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Assuming all three signals have unique chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data (which specifies two aromatic singlets).\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The total would be **three aromatic singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio). This does not match the data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) correctly predicts the number and integration ratios of all signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1.

This indicates that there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons represented by each singlet must be equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are singlets, which means there is no splitting between adjacent protons. This suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups (or other groups with no adjacent protons, like t-butyl, but methyl fits the formula).\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and expected 1H NMR spectra of the possible compounds:**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula for all options.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C6+4 H4+10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow, let's predict the spectrum for each compound individually, focusing on the number of signals and their integration, based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 and C4 equivalent, C2 and C3 equivalent, and H5 and H6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The CH2 group would be a **quartet** and the CH3 group would be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options as a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two** aromatic singlets and **three** aliphatic singlets. Since each pure tetramethylbenzene isomer gives only one aromatic singlet, a mixture of any two of them will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, which is a safe bet). Since the mixture is 1:1 and each aromatic signal comes from 2 protons, the 1:1 integration ratio in the aromatic region is satisfied by any pair. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's check the combination of aliphatic signals for each option.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of four aliphatic signals, unless some accidentally overlap. To get three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap perfectly to form a single 6H signal. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it requires an assumption of accidental overlap.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of five aliphatic signals. To get three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and multiple accidental overlaps would be required. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined, this mixture naturally produces **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   The integration of these signals would be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of integration is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This matches the experimental data perfectly without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n*   All options provided are isomers with this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14. (Correct)\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture. This means the total signal intensity from each compound is equal.\n\n**2. Analyze the Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   The presence of only singlets for the alkyl groups is a very strong clue. It means none of the protons on the alkyl carbons are adjacent to other protons. This is characteristic of methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon, but not ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl, or isopropyl groups, which would show splitting (quartets, triplets, etc.).\n*   Let's examine **1,4-diethylbenzene**. The two ethyl groups would produce a quartet (for the -CH2- protons) and a triplet (for the -CH3 protons) in the aliphatic region. This contradicts the data that all signals are singlets.\n*   **Conclusion:** 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This immediately rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm)**\n\n*   The data shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces **one singlet** in the aromatic region, and these two singlets have slightly different chemical shifts.\n*   Let's predict the aromatic signals for the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6). Due to the planes of symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has less symmetry. There are two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6). The proton at C4 is in a different chemical environment from the proton at C6. Therefore, they are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct singlets (1H each)**. This compound does *not* fit the requirement of producing only one aromatic signal. This rules out options B and D, as they both contain this compound.\n\n         \n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two adjacent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (which would normally lead to splitting), because they are chemically and magnetically equivalent, they behave as a single group and produce a **single singlet (2H)**. This compound fits the requirement.\n\n         \n\n**4. Confirm the correct pair by analyzing the combined Aliphatic Signals**\n\n*   Based on the aromatic signals, the only possible pair is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option C). Let's verify this by checking if their combined aliphatic signals match the data (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12 protons (4 x CH3).\n\n    *   **Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a second **singlet** (6H).\n\n*   **Combining the spectra:**\n    *   In the 1:1 mixture, we will see the signals from both compounds.\n    *   Total number of aliphatic singlets = 1 (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 2 (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) = **3 singlets**. This matches the data.\n    *   The integrals of these three signals will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the given NMR data (aromatic and aliphatic regions) is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3) due to spin-spin coupling. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option C.\n\n**3. Analyze the spectra of the proposed mixtures (in a 1:1 ratio).**\n\nWe are looking for a combination that gives:\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n*   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\nSince all three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers have one singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, any 1:1 mixture of two different isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each integrating to 2H, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor will be the signals from the methyl groups.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show three singlets in the aliphatic region with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mixture perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H each)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture would show up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, the ratio would be (6+6+6):3:3 or 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H)\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This mixture will show four singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Integral Ratio:** 12:6:3:3, which simplifies to 4:2:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that matches the experimental data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (¹H NMR):** Two singlets, ratio 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (¹H NMR):** Three singlets, ratio 2:1:1.\n\nWe need to identify the two compounds from the given options:\n1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **2. Verify Molecular Formula and Analyze Individual Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula and predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through C4 and C1-C2.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14.

Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical para-substituted benzene.\n    *   Aromatic protons: All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: The ethyl groups have methylene (-CH2-) and methyl (-CH3) protons. Due to spin-spin coupling, these will not be singlets.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet (4H)**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, as the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds from the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Each of the three candidate isomers (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) produces a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region.\n*   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will show two singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different), each integrating to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H or 1:1.\n*   This information confirms we have a mixture of two of these isomers but doesn't differentiate between the possible pairs.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound A) + 12H (from compound B) = 24H.\n*   The total ratio is 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n*   We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Therefore, the mixture must have three aliphatic singlets corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\nNow, let's see which pair of compounds produces this pattern:\n*   **Aliphatic signals from individuals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one signal for 12H\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two signals for 6H each\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: three signals for 6H, 3H, 3H\n\n*   **Consider the mixture from option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Let's check other combinations to be sure:**\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option D):** Signals would be {12H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in four signals. To get three signals, an accidental overlap would be required, but no simple overlap yields a 2:1:1 ratio of the total 24H.\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option B):** Signals would be {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This gives up to five signals. Again, this combination cannot simply produce the {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern required.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that directly explains the observed ¹H NMR data for the mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Information Given**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are all equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    - Alkyl Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons would appear as a **quartet (4H)** and the CH3 protons as a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would produce quartets and triplets, but the problem states all observed signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons (on other carbons) and are equivalent to each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Fits)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups and the center of the ring.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at C2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at C5 is unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **3. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum for Each Option**\n\nNow, we combine the spectra of the individual compounds for each option, assuming a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** The spectrum of the mixture shows **two** singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers individually produces only **one** aromatic singlet (of intensity 2H), the mixture must contain two different isomers whose aromatic singlets appear at different chemical shifts. As both singlets originate from 2 protons, their ratio will naturally be 1:1. All remaining options (A, C, D) are pairs of different isomers and are thus plausible based on the aromatic region alone.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** This is the decisive part. The mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's see which pair produces this pattern.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet of intensity 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets, each of intensity 6H.\n        *   **Combined:** Assuming these three signals appear at different chemical shifts, we would get three singlets with intensities 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **12:6:6**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This combination perfectly matches the experimental data without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in a total of four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Combined:** This would result in up to five different alkyl singlets. To get only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio (i.e., intensities 12H, 6H, 6H from a total of 24 methyl protons), multiple specific, accidental overlaps would need to occur. This is a much less likely and less straightforward explanation than Option A.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Option A) is the only pair that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two 2H singlets give a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** One 12H singlet and two 6H singlets give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectra of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry. The number of signals corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal will be a **singlet**. The integration will be for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet**, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetric. There are no simple planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at position 4 and the proton at position 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct signals**. Since they are meta to each other, the coupling is negligible, so both signals appear as **singlets**. Each integrates to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups in different environments. One might expect four separate signals. However, due to very similar chemical environments (accidental equivalence), the spectrum typically shows **three singlet signals** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**. Since they are equivalent, they don't split each other, appearing as a **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlet signals**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄. (Correct)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** that integrates to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH₂) protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH₃), and the methyl (CH₃) protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH₂).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and compare with the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). This mixture will show **two aromatic singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The total spectrum will have **three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). The total spectrum would have **three aromatic signals**. This does not match the data (\"two signals\").\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: This mixture would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB, but also a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. The experimental data states there are only **three singlets** in the alkyl region. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that fits all the spectral data is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The presence of two distinct signals implies we are seeing signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n    *   For the ratio to be 1:1 in a 1:1 mixture, each signal must arise from the same number of protons.\n    *   Since there are only two signals in total for the mixture, it is most likely that each compound contributes exactly one singlet in this region. Therefore, we are looking for two compounds that each have only one type of aromatic proton.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals must come from the methyl (CH3) or ethyl (CH2CH3) groups. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, suggesting the protons on the alkyl groups are not coupled to any other non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups attached to the aromatic ring. Ethyl groups would show a quartet and a triplet.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals for each compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (integrating to 12H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic singlet.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent, but because they are chemically equivalent, they will appear as **one singlet** (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** (each integrating to 6H).\n    *   *Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and the C5-methyl group) are in different environments. This will produce **two singlets** (each integrating to 1H).\n    *   *This compound alone would produce two aromatic signals. Therefore, it cannot be part of a mixture that has only two aromatic signals in total (one from each component).* This eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Options A, C, and D).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are *singlets*. An ethyl group produces a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture. This also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Verify the correct combination:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the only possible combination is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB (1:1 molar ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (from 2H).\n    *   Total: Two singlets. Since they both originate from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (from 12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each from 6H).\n    *   Total: Three singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio of these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives a simplified ratio of **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the identity of two C10H14 isomers in a 1:1 mixture by interpreting their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the problem description:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, and all have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14.\n2.  **Mixture:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio, combined with the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same.\n    *   Since both are singlets, the aromatic protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons (or they are equivalent to the protons they would couple with).\n4.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals are singlets, which suggests they come from methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to any protons. This is consistent with tetramethylbenzene isomers but rules out diethylbenzene (which would show coupled ethyl group signals - a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   Let's determine the number of protons corresponding to this ratio. Since both compounds are tetramethylbenzene isomers, each molecule has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 total aliphatic protons.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   Protons for signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Protons for signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Protons for signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's aliphatic region must contain three singlets corresponding to environments with 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the Individual 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each possible compound. We can immediately eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** because its ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {12H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 (3H) and C5 (3H) are each unique. This results in **three singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but chemically equivalent, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other (6H). This results in **two singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 6H}\n\n### Step 3: Test the Combinations (Options) Against the Spectral Data\n\nNow we combine the predicted signals for each pair of compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see which combination matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Observed Spectrum:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations {12H, 6H, 6H}\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect (unless there's an unlikely accidental overlap of the two 3H signals to form a 6H signal, which would lead to a {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. But we should prefer a more direct explanation).\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 6H}. This combination provides exactly three singlets with the required 12H:6H:6H integration. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region.\n*   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the chemical environments of these protons are different in the two molecules, they will appear at different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in at least three unique signal sets, likely more. It does not match the observed {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains both the aliphatic and aromatic regions of the described 1H NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given 1H NMR data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all compounds. A quick check confirms this for all four options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(ring) + 4 x CH3 = C10H14.\n        *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(ring) + 2 x C2H5 = C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second aromatic signal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that the number of aromatic protons per molecule for each of the two compounds is the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) protons. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no adjacent proton to cause splitting (i.e., no H on an adjacent carbon). This is true for methyl groups on a benzene ring, but not for ethyl groups.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   All four methyl groups are also equivalent. They will produce **one aliphatic singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H), and the methyl at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H). This gives **three aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is 2:1:1.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (second signal, 6H). This gives **two aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   The ethyl groups give a quartet (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options against the experimental data:**\n\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The data shows two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   A mixture of any compound with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H singlet) and a tetramethylbenzene (2H singlet) would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 integration ratio, not 1:1. This immediately **eliminates option C**.\n        *   A mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzenes (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) would work for the aromatic region, as each gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would result in two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The data shows three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. We need to check the combinations from the remaining options (A, B, D).\n\n        *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Total: Three singlets.\n            *   Integration: 12H : 6H : 6H.\n            *   Ratio: **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n        *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Four singlets. This contradicts the \"three signals\" observation. The integration ratio would be 12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1, which is also incorrect.\n\n        *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, we would have four signals (one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H signals), which gives an incorrect number of signals and an incorrect ratio (12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features of the spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (or appear as singlets) is crucial. This means that the protons giving rise to each signal are not coupled to any non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This would produce a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with. This produces **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, they form an AA' system which appears as **one singlet (2H)** in the spectrum.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but they are in a different chemical environment from the C1/C4 pair. This produces **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This produces **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This would produce **four different singlets (3H each)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). This would result in three signals (unless there is accidental overlap), which does not match \"two signals\".\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (2 singlets, 6H each) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to six signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** (1 singlet, 2H) + (2 singlets, 1H each). Again, this would result in three signals, not two.\n    *   **Alkyl region:** (1 singlet, 12H) + (4 singlets, 3H each). This would result in up to five signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integrals will be equal, resulting in a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Assuming these three signals have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 ratio is the only option that produces a 1H NMR spectrum matching all the described features.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   All candidate compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the same molecular formula: C10H14.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The total number of protons per molecule is 14.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, the fact that the signals have a 1:1 intensity ratio means that each signal arises from the same number of protons.\n    *   This strongly suggests that we are mixing two compounds, each of which produces a single, distinct singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons responsible for each singlet is identical.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals must be the sum of all the alkyl proton signals from the two compounds in the mixture.\n    *   Let's determine the total number of protons represented by this alkyl region. All C10H14 isomers with a benzene ring and only methyl/ethyl substituents are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: 4 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH3. This leaves 6 - 4 = 2 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 4 * 3 = 12. Total = 2 + 12 = 14.\n        *   Diethylbenzenes: 2 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH2CH3. This leaves 6 - 2 = 4 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 2 * (2+3) = 10. Total = 4 + 10 = 14.\n    *   The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. This immediately rules out **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet (for the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (for the -CH3 groups) due to spin-spin coupling. This eliminates option C.\n    *   So, both compounds must be tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each molecule has 2 aromatic protons and 12 alkyl (methyl) protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24 protons.\n    *   The ratio of the three singlets is 2:1:1. Let the integration of the smallest peak be 'x'. Then the integrations are 2x, x, and x.\n    *   The total integration is 2x + x + x = 4x.\n    *   So, 4x = 24 protons, which means x = 6 protons.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the alkyl region must integrate to **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Candidate**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each tetramethylbenzene isomer, focusing on the number and integration of signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. They produce **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry (or, under some conditions, a plane of symmetry leading to a different prediction, but we will see this compound is ruled out by the aromatic signal count). The most rigorous analysis shows different environments for the protons and methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They would produce **two separate singlets**, each for **1H**. This contradicts the requirement for a compound that gives a *single* aromatic signal. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture, as its presence would lead to at least three signals in the aromatic region. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Mixture**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** matches all the data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The intensity ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one singlet corresponding to **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives two singlets, each corresponding to **6H**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** All candidate compounds must have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's check this for all options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6 carbons in the ring + 4 methyl carbons = 10 carbons. 2 hydrogens on the ring + 4 * 3 hydrogens on methyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14. This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6 carbons in the ring + 2 * 2 carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + 2 * 5 hydrogens on ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. Formula is C10H14.\n        *   All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This implies we are mixing two compounds, let's call them Compound X and Compound Y.\n        *   Each compound must produce a single peak (a singlet) for all its aromatic protons. This happens when all aromatic protons in a molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of aromatic protons in Compound X is equal to the number of aromatic protons in Compound Y (since the molar ratio of X:Y is 1:1).\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   This combined signal arises from the alkyl protons of both compounds.\n        *   The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling for these alkyl groups. This is true for methyl (CH3) groups attached to an aromatic ring, but not for ethyl (CH2CH3) groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet).\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups at C1, C2, C4, and C5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H), {C2-Me} is unique (3H), and {C5-Me} is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or **2:1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1-Me, C4-Me} are equivalent (6H), and {C2-Me, C3-Me} are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, or **1:1**.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four protons at C2, C3, C5, and C6 are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3 that are not equivalent and will couple with each other. This will produce **one quartet** (4H total) for the CH2 groups and **one triplet** (6H total) for the CH3 groups.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n    *   First, we can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene. Its spectrum shows a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, but the problem states there are only singlets. Furthermore, it has 4 aromatic protons, while the other candidates have 2. A 1:1 mixture with a tetramethylbenzene isomer would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 ratio for the aromatic signals, not the observed 1:1 ratio. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n    *   We are now left with combinations of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. All of them give a single singlet for their 2 aromatic protons, so any 1:1 mixture of two different ones will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This part of the data fits options A, B, and D. We must use the alkyl region data to distinguish between them.\n\n    *   **Let's check the alkyl signals for the remaining options:**\n\n        *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 2 = **three singlets**.\n            *   Integration ratio: 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n            *   **This matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n        *   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 2 + 3 = up to five singlets. This contradicts the observation of only three signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H peaks, we would get four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which is not what is observed.\n\n        *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n            *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**.\n            *   Total signals: 1 + 3 = **four singlets**. This contradicts the observation of only three signals.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the mixture described in Option A produces a combined 1H NMR spectrum that matches the data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options**\n\nFirst, let's confirm all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4):** C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their splitting patterns (multiplicity), and their relative integrations.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H singlet, one 12H singlet).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They are not adjacent to other protons, giving one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three separate **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 4 signals total (one 2H singlet, three aliphatic singlets with 6H, 3H, and 3H integrations).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent, giving a second **singlet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H singlet, two 6H singlets).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups produce:\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (split by the CH3).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (split by the CH2).\n    *   The problem states all signals are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This also eliminates option B.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (A, C, D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Key Data Points for the Mixture:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio. The total aliphatic protons from a 1:1 mixture are 12H + 12H = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the signals must integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H respectively.\n\n**Let's test Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and a 12H aliphatic singlet.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Provides a 2H aromatic singlet and two 6H aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:** We have one 2H singlet from the first compound and one 2H singlet from the second. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, this results in **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals arise from 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** We have one 12H singlet from the first compound and two separate 6H singlets from the second compound. Assuming these three signals are all resolved (have different chemical shifts), the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the data perfectly.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the spectrum without needing to assume any unusual overlaps (accidental degeneracies).\n\n**Why other options are less likely:**\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aliphatic signals would be one 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This would result in four aliphatic signals unless two signals happened to have the exact same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy). To get the 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from Isodurene would need to be degenerate, which is possible but less straightforward than the explanation provided by option D.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** This combination would give two 6H singlets from the first compound and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the second. This would result in up to five aliphatic signals. To achieve the observed spectrum, it would require multiple, unlikely accidental degeneracies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that directly predicts an NMR spectrum with two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H (4 x 3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A proper analysis shows the following equivalences:\n        *   Protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two equivalent protons (H4, H6) will give one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. This will result in three **singlets**.\n        *   Singlet 1: C1-CH3 and C3-CH3 (equivalent). Integration: 6H.\n        *   Singlet 2: C2-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n        *   Singlet 3: C5-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. It matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. Ethyl groups show a characteristic quartet (for the CH2) and triplet (for the CH3) pattern due to spin-spin splitting. They do not produce singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the experimental spectrum only shows singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the mixture based on the predictions:**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture. This means we add the spectra of two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet of integration 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different, which is expected), each corresponding to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H = 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio means the total integration (2+1+1=4 parts) is divided into signals with relative sizes of 2/4, 1/4, and 1/4.\n    *   Absolute integrations: (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**4. Test the remaining options:**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would result in at least 4 signals (if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, and two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data from the spectrum without requiring any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H singlets. This is four signals. To get three signals with the correct 12H, 6H, 6H integrations, the two 3H signals must accidentally have the exact same chemical shift (accidental isochrony) to appear as one 6H signal. While possible, the combination in option C explains the data directly and is therefore the much more likely answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed 1H NMR spectrum, which shows two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4), which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The solution contains a 1:1 molar mixture of the two compounds.\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals in both the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) and the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm). The signals are all described as singlets, which is a crucial clue about the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecules.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at 1, 2, 4, 5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three distinct singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, producing a pair of **doublets** (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states the aromatic signals are singlets, **Prehnitene can be eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent, producing a single **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Elimination**\n\n*   Options B and C include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), which is incorrect because it would produce doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   Option A includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect because it would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n\nBy this process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n**4. Verify the Spectrum of the Mixture in Option D**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of Durene and Isodurene matches the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The observed spectrum has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The first 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        *   The second 6H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two 1H singlets.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   The observed spectrum has two signals in a 1:1 ratio. For 4 total protons, this corresponds to integrals of **2H and 2H**.\n    *   How is this formed?\n        *   The first 2H signal comes from Durene.\n        *   The second 2H signal is formed by the **accidental overlap (degeneracy)** of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to Option D. Verifying the combined spectrum of this mixture shows that it is fully consistent with the observed data, assuming two plausible instances of accidental signal overlap, a common phenomenon in NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data of the Mixture:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n        *   Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Options:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n        *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n2.  **Verify Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4): 6C (ring) + 4C (methyls) = 10C. 2H (ring) + 12H (methyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is correct for all three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2): 6C (ring) + 4C (ethyls) = 10C. 4H (ring) + 10H (ethyls) = 14H. Formula C10H14 is also correct.\n    All four compounds are isomers and fit the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound:**\n    This analysis focuses on symmetry to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent. This will produce a single **singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet contradicts the data, which states there are only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are adjacent to each other. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent, but because they are coupled to each other (and to the methyl groups differently), they are magnetically non-equivalent. This will lead to splitting. The signal will appear as an **AB quartet or a pair of doublets**, not as singlets.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a non-singlet signal in the aromatic region contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is not in the mixture.** This eliminates options **A** and **D**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Option:**\n    By elimination, the only remaining possibility is option **B**, which is a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two equivalent protons (H-3, H-6). This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   **Alkyl:** Four equivalent methyl groups. This gives **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic:** Two non-equivalent protons (H-4 and H-6). They are not adjacent, so they will appear as **two separate singlets** (1H each).\n        *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups based on their environment. The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, the group at C2 is unique, and the group at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with integrals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (which is a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture (Durene + Isodurene):**\n    Now, we combine the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see if it matches the experimental data, allowing for potential accidental overlaps of signals with very similar chemical shifts.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets.\n        *   **Observation:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of aromatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 2H (from Durene) + (1H + 1H) (from Isodurene) = 4H. For two signals to have a 1:1 ratio, each must integrate to 2H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 is the 2H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 is a single 2H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 1H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n        *   **Signals available:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   **Observation:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n        *   **Explanation:** The total number of alkyl protons is 12H (Durene) + (6H + 3H + 3H) (Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H means the signals must have integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This can occur if:\n            *   Signal 1 (relative intensity 2) is the 12H singlet from Durene.\n            *   Signal 2 (relative intensity 1) is the 6H singlet from Isodurene.\n            *   Signal 3 (relative intensity 1) is a 6H peak formed by the accidental overlap of the two 3H singlets from Isodurene.\n        *   This configuration also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe process of elimination definitively rules out options A, C, and D. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the information given in the 1H NMR spectrum, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps of signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe task is to identify the two compounds from the given options that would produce this combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Due to the high symmetry, they give a single signal, which is a **singlet** (no adjacent protons to couple with). This signal integrates to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**, integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 1 singlet (12H)\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They give a **single singlet** (no adjacent protons) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1)\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, they are magnetically equivalent due to symmetry and thus appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (total 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:**\n        *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n        *   Aliphatic: 2 singlets (ratio 1:1)\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a **single singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals will not be singlets. The two equivalent CH2 groups will be a **quartet**, and the two equivalent CH3 groups will be a **triplet**. The problem statement specifies only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound can be ruled out from any potential mixture.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixtures in the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that results in:\n*   2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.

Analyze the Input Data from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of the two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most restrictive pieces of information are that **all observed signals are singlets** and the specific integration patterns.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four options provided.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3):** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. In principle, they should produce **four separate singlets**, each integrating to 3H. However, accidental equivalence (where signals overlap by chance) is very common for similar methyl groups, so we might observe fewer than four signals. Based on spectral databases (like SDBS), it often shows three signals in a 6H:3H:3H ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing an AB quartet or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will appear as a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (CH3CH2):** The protons of the ethyl group will show spin-spin coupling. The CH2 group will be a **quartet**, and the CH3 group will be a **triplet**. These are not singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\n*   Options containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (B and D) are incorrect because this compound would show multiplets (not singlets) in the aromatic region.\n*   The option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** (A) is incorrect because this compound would show a quartet and a triplet (not singlets) in the alkyl region.\n\nThis process of elimination leaves only **Option C** as the possible answer.\n\n**4. Verify Option C**\n\nLet's confirm if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** matches the given spectral data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1 mole of 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1 mole of 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Total aromatic protons = 2H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 2H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 4H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (2H):** The single singlet from the two equivalent protons of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   **Signal 2 (2H):** The two different 1H protons from 1,2,3,5-TMB must be *accidentally equivalent* (have the same chemical shift), thus appearing as a single singlet with an integration of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. For a total of 24 protons, this corresponds to signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   How this is achieved:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** The single singlet from the four equivalent methyl groups of 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        *   The remaining signals (6H and 6H) must come from the 12 protons of the four methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-TMB. This means the four non-equivalent 3H singlets must pair up due to accidental equivalence.\n        *   **Signal 2 (6H):** Two of the 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift.\n        *   **Signal 3 (6H):** The other two 3H methyl singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have the same chemical shift (but different from Signal 2).\n    *   This combination also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that fits the spectral data, allowing for plausible accidental chemical shift equivalences, is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Information Given in the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's deconstruct the spectral data provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A singlet indicates that the aromatic protons have no adjacent (or vicinal) proton neighbors.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet. For example, this could be a 2H singlet from Compound A and a 2H singlet from Compound B.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   Singlets in this region are characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring that have no protons on adjacent carbons of the ring.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in one molecule of tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4) is 4 * 3 = 12 protons. Since we have a 1:1 mixture, the spectrum represents a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons corresponding to each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the three alkyl singlets must correspond to groups of 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integrations for each compound listed in the options. All options have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are also equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1, C3}, {C2}, and {C5}. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: {C1, C4} and {C2, C3}. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   The alkyl protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (4H), and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (6H). The presence of non-singlet signals in the alkyl region immediately eliminates this compound as a possibility, as the problem states all three alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Combinations from the Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the observed data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: The spectrum would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contradicts the \"all singlets\" description. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   The mixture shows **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet for 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n        *   The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Candidate Structures**\nAll four options have the molecular formula C10H14, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data of the 1:1 Mixture**\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nTo solve this, we must first predict the number of signals, multiplicity, and relative integrals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They would produce a **single 4H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups have -CH2- and -CH3- protons. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet and the -CH3- protons would be a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because it would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, but the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has high symmetry with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (12 protons total) are equivalent. They will produce **one 12H singlet**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes positions 1 and 4 equivalent, 2 and 3 equivalent, and 5 and 6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence often leads to the collapse of the expected doublet into a **single 2H singlet** (a common feature for this specific molecule).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two 6H singlets**, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at positions 4 and 6 equivalent. This will produce **one 2H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent (a 6H signal). The methyl group at position 2 is unique (a 3H signal), and the methyl group at position 5 is also unique (a 3H signal). This results in **three singlets** with integrals of **6H, 3H, and 3H**, which is a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options for the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow, let's test which 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) would produce the observed spectrum. The total number of alkyl protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12H + 12H = 24H. The observed 2:1:1 ratio must be applied to this total.\n*   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n*   Integral of the signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n\nSo, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined alkyl signals produce three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options again. We can exclude any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a total of **four signals** with integrals 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H (assuming no overlap). This does not match the data \"three signals\".\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) -> This produces **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals come from 2 protons, the integral ratio will be **1:1**. This fits the data perfectly.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Durene gives **one 12H singlet**. Prehnitene gives **two 6H singlets**. Combining these gives exactly **three signals** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also fits the data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.** (This fits).\n    *   Alkyl: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H) -> This gives a minimum of 3 signals (if all 6H peaks overlap) of 18H, 3H, 3H, a ratio of 6:1:1. This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture share the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options. We need to analyze their structures for chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. However, within an ethyl group, the -CH2- and -CH3 protons are different and they split each other. We would expect a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because the problem states the aliphatic signals are *all singlets*. We can eliminate any answer choice containing it (Option D).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h). The molecule has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a mirror plane that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (a pair). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent (a second pair). This produces **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Experimental data shows this molecule does not behave as if it's perfectly symmetrical on the NMR timescale, likely due to steric hindrance preventing free rotation of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This produces **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups fall into three distinct environments, producing **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A single molecule of this compound would produce two aromatic signals. The problem states the *mixture* produces two aromatic signals. If this compound were part of the mixture, it would likely result in more than two aromatic signals in total, or a ratio other than 1:1. Therefore, it's unlikely to be in the mixture.\n\n**3. Test the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that each contribute *one* aromatic singlet. This rules out 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and thus options A, B, and D. Option C is the only remaining possibility. Let's confirm it's correct.\n\n**Test Option C: A 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   Since they are different molecules, their singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is **two singlets**.\n    *   Because the mixture is 1:1 and both signals represent 2H, their integral ratio will be **1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum will therefore have a total of **three singlets**.\n    *   The integrals of these three singlets will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This also perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that perfectly reproduces the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nThis problem requires us to determine which two compounds from the given options are present in a 1:1 mixture, based on its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets (except for potentially some aromatic coupling which is absent here) points towards isomers of tetramethylbenzene or other highly symmetric structures. The presence of quartets and triplets would indicate ethyl groups, which is not observed.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four compounds:**\n\nWe need to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent.

Integral: 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This results in two **singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving a single **singlet**.

Evaluate the remaining options:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the described spectrum. Let's test the combinations.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Let's assume a 1:1 mixture.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (2H). Prehnitene contributes another singlet (2H). If these two signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrals will be 2H and 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene contributes one singlet (12H). Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each). If all three of these signals have different chemical shifts, we will see **three singlets**. The integral ratio would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination fully explains the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **Option C (Durene + Isodurene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from durene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n    *   **Option D (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from prehnitene and two 1H singlets from isodurene), contradicting the observation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This is a crucial starting point.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound produces an aromatic signal of equal total proton integration. The fact that there are *two* signals means the signals from each compound are at different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. There are no other types of signals (like doublets, triplets, or quartets). The total spectrum is the sum of the signals from the two compounds.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each candidate compound's expected 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    We need to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and integration for each of the four options based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: It is a para-disubstituted benzene ring, which is highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. An ethyl group gives a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-).\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the experimental data, which states there are only *singlets* in the alkyl region. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as **one singlet** (2H).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet** (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet** (2H). (This is an AA' system, which appears as a singlet).\n        *   Alkyl protons: Symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. These two pairs are not equivalent to each other. This results in **two singlets** (6H each).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule has no symmetry. All protons are in unique chemical environments.\n        *   Aromatic protons: The two protons (at C4 and C6) are not equivalent. Each has two methyl neighbors, so they are not split. This results in **two singlets** (1H each).\n        *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups are all non-equivalent. This results in **four singlets** (3H each).\n        *   Conclusion: If this compound were present, it would by itself produce two aromatic singlets and four alkyl singlets. This contradicts the mixture's data (two aromatic singlets total, three alkyl singlets total). So this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the correct pair:**\n    From the analysis above, we have eliminated 1,4-diethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The only remaining possibilities are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio)\n\n    *   **Predicted Aromatic Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (for 2H).\n        *   Combined: **Two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the signals will have an integration ratio of **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Predicted Alkyl Spectrum:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (for 12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (each for 6H).\n        *   Combined: **Three singlets**. The relative proton integration will be 12H : 6H : 6H. Dividing by the smallest number (6) gives an integration ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that matches all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis problem requires us to identify a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers from a given list, based on their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**1.

Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test each option by combining the spectra of the individual compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 2H singlet = Two 1:1 singlets. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** [1s (12H)] + [3s (6H, 3H, 3H)] = Four signals total with integrations {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}, unless there's accidental overlap. This contradicts the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet + 2H singlet = Two 1:1 singlets. (Matches)\n    *   **Aliphatic:** [2s (6H, 6H)] + [3s (6H, 3H, 3H)] = Five signals total {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}, unless there's overlap.

(Does not match the 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would contain non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet). (Does not match).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB.

The combined spectrum will have **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. (Matches)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the provided 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the composition of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum. We will analyze the predicted spectrum for each possible compound and then see which combination matches the experimental data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nSince it is a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratios reflect the combined protons from both compounds. The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region means the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nAll four proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14. Let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms and their attached methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent by this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would show a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3). This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. This compound can be ruled out.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining three compounds would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (assuming different chemical shifts). This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals unless there is accidental overlap. If there's one overlap to produce three signals, the ratio would be (12+6):3:3 = 18:3:3 = 6:1:1, which does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). Assuming no overlap, the mixture would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both give a 2H singlet, so a 1:1 mixture gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). Without overlap, this would be five signals. To get three signals, there would need to be significant, specific overlaps. It is far less likely to produce a clean 2:1:1 ratio compared to option C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only combination that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR data. The two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) come from the two non-equivalent aromatic environments in the two molecules. The three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio) come from the 12H singlet of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and the two distinct 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The spectral data is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Constraint:** All signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\nWe need to choose the correct pair from the given options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Molecules**\n\nFirst, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry horizontally and vertically through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl group at C5 and the one at C2.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n    *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The \"outer\" methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The \"inner\" methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n    *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons will couple with the -CH3- protons, producing a **quartet** (4H). The -CH3- protons will couple with the -CH2- protons, producing a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives multiplets (quartet, triplet), not just singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining pairs and see if a 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum. The mixture is 1:1, so the total number of protons from each compound is equal.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** \"Two singlets... in a 1:1 ratio\".\n    *   All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single aromatic singlet for their 2 protons. When any two are mixed, we will have two sets of 2 aromatic protons. Since they are from different molecules, their chemical environments are different, leading to two distinct singlets. The integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which is 1:1. This observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** \"Three singlets... in a 2:1:1 ratio\".\n    *   Let's check the options based on the alkyl signals they would produce in a mixture.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals for {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This would result in up to five signals, or fewer if they overlap. The problem states there are only three signals. For this to be true, significant and specific overlap must occur to yield three signals with a final 2:1:1 ratio. This is highly unlikely. The total alkyl protons are 12+12=24. A 2:1:1 ratio means signals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. Combining signals of {6, 6, 6, 3, 3} cannot produce this result. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5- gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined mixture would have signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H. This is a total of four signals (assuming no overlap) with a ratio of 4:2:1:1. This does not match the observed three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n        *   1,2,4,5- (Durene) gives **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) gives **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n        *   The combined mixture would show three distinct singlets in the alkyl region with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description of the alkyl region.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (one 2H signal from each compound).\n*   **Alkyl:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (one 12H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 6H signals from 1,2,3,4-).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided**\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n2.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlet signals with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are around 2.2 ppm, characteristic of methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.\n4.  **The Candidates:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **Step 2: Check Molecular Formulas and Rule out Candidates Based on Signal Type**\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** All four compounds, the three tetramethylbenzenes (C6H2(CH3)4) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2), have the molecular formula C10H14. This does not eliminate any options.\n*   **Signal Type Check:** The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are **singlets**.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups. The protons of the ethyl groups (-CH2- and -CH3) would couple with each other, producing a **quartet** and a **triplet**, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Isomer**\nWe need to determine the number of signals and their relative integrations for the three tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a single signal. Although they are adjacent, in such an A2 spin system, they produce a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second, different signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**. The ratio is 6:6 or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\nNow we combine the spectra of the pairs in the remaining options (B, C, D) and see which one matches the experimental data for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**Experimental Data Requirements:**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of methyl protons is 12 (from one molecule) + 12 (from the other) = 24H.\n    *   The ratio 2:1:1 has a total of 4 parts. So the signals must correspond to integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   We are looking for a pair of compounds whose combined methyl signals are: one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2 (from one molecule) + 2 (from the other) = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio means the two signals must each integrate to **2H**.\n\n**Let's test the options:**\n\n*   **B) Durene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {12H} from Durene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene = A total of 4 signals. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **C) Prehnitene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: {6H, 6H} from Prehnitene + {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene. The combination does not produce the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. **Does not match.**\n\n*   **D) Durene + Prehnitene**\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two separate singlets of **6H** each.\n        *   The total is three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet of **2H**.\n        *   These two signals are from non-identical molecules, so they will likely have slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in two separate signals. Each signal integrates to 2H. The ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is also a perfect match.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) is the only one that perfectly reproduces all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar (1:1).\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry both horizontally and vertically through the ring.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 2H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 12H.\n        *   *Summary of Durene spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce one singlet signal. Integral: 2H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n            1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This gives one singlet. Integral: 6H.\n            2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a second singlet. Integral: 3H.\n            3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives a third singlet. Integral: 3H.\n        *   *Summary of Isodurene spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: There is a C2 axis of symmetry.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other and are not chemically equivalent. They will couple, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets.\n        *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated because it would not produce only singlets in the aromatic region.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   Molecular Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n        *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical.\n        *   Aromatic Protons: All four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing one singlet. Integral: 4H.\n        *   Alkyl Protons: The ethyl groups consist of CH2 and CH3 protons. Due to spin-spin coupling, the CH2 signal will be a quartet and the CH3 signal will be a triplet.\n        *   *Conclusion:* This compound can be eliminated because the problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\n    *   Options B, C, and D can be immediately ruled out.\n        *   Options B and D include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which would show doublets, not singlets, in the aromatic region.\n        *   Option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet, not only singlets, in the alkyl region.\n\n    *   This leaves **Option A** as the only possibility. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene matches the described spectrum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture in Option A:**\n    *   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Since they are different compounds, their aromatic protons will likely have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet with a relative integration of 12H.\n        *   Isodurene contributes three singlets with relative integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   In total, we have four distinct signals from the methyl groups with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The problem states that only **three singlets** are observed with a **2:1:1 ratio**. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n        *   Let's check what kind of overlap would produce a 2:1:1 ratio. The total integration in the alkyl region corresponds to 24 protons (12 from Durene, 12 from Isodurene). A 2:1:1 ratio means the integrals of the observed peaks are proportional to 2x, 1x, and 1x. The total is 4x. So, 4x = 24H, which means x = 6H. The observed signals must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   How can we get these from the individual signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H)?\n            *   The 12H signal comes from Durene.\n            *   The 6H signal comes from the C1/C3 methyls of Isodurene.\n            *   To get the second 6H signal, the two 3H signals from the C2 and C5 methyls of Isodurene must have the same chemical shift (accidental degeneracy) and therefore overlap into a single peak.\n        *   This scenario results in three peaks with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both are described as **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **1:1**. This means the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three are **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **2:1:1**. This tells us the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three distinct alkyl signals.\n\n### **2. Analyze the molecular structures and predict the ¹H NMR spectra for each candidate compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h). It has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low symmetry. As confirmed by spectral databases, there are distinct environments for its protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This gives **two signals**. They are meta-coupled, which is a very small coupling, so they appear as **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Experimental data shows there are three distinct signals due to accidental chemical shift equivalence of two methyl groups. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** One mirror plane.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. These protons are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so technically they should form a doublet or an AB quartet. However, it's a single signal representing **2H**. For this problem, we'll consider it \"one signal\".\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two signals**. Both are **singlets** with integrations of **6H and 6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic signal (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Four equivalent protons, giving **one signal (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups give a **quartet (4H)** for the CH₂ groups and a **triplet (6H)** for the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be **eliminated immediately** because its alkyl spectrum contains a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. This eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the remaining combinations for a 1:1 mixture**\n\nNow, we check the remaining options by \"adding\" the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (2 signals, 6H each) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 5 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   Total: **2 signals**. The integral ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Alkyl:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 2 signals, each for 6H.\n    *   Total: **3 signals**. The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H. Dividing by the smallest value (6H), we get a ratio of **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option perfectly matches all aspects of the provided NMR data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (1 signal, 12H) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 4 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only combination that fits the experimental data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that each compound has aromatic protons.\n    *   The protons within each molecule must be chemically equivalent to each other to appear as a single singlet.\n    *   The two compounds are different, so their aromatic singlets appear at slightly different chemical shifts.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds and tells us that each compound contributes the same number of aromatic protons to its respective signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals being singlets indicates that the protons are not coupled to any neighboring non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a quaternary carbon, like on an aromatic ring.\n    *   We need to find a combination of two compounds that, when mixed 1:1, will produce three methyl signals in this specific 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and predict the 1H NMR spectra for each option:**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow let's predict the spectrum for each compound, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. However, the ethyl groups would show coupling. We would expect a triplet for the -CH3 protons and a quartet for the -CH2- protons. Since the problem states all signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.** This also eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the plane of symmetry). The methyl group at C5 is also unique (on the plane of symmetry). This gives **three aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 3H, one for 3H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixture options:**\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, matches the observed spectrum. We already confirmed that any 1:1 pair of the three tetramethylbenzenes will give two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio, as they each have one 2H aromatic singlet. The key is to match the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This would produce **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This produces **three** aliphatic singlets, with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: Even with a coincidental overlap of one 6H signal from each compound, this would result in four signals with integrations (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds. Let's break down the spectral information:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are equal in number.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This tells us there are three distinct types of methyl protons, and their relative abundance is 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no proton-proton coupling between adjacent carbon atoms for any of these alkyl groups (which is expected for methyl groups attached to a benzene ring).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its individual 1H NMR spectrum. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: (the inner ones at C2 and C3) and (the outer ones at C1 and C4). This results in **two singlets**, each representing 6 hydrogens (6H). Their integration ratio would be 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two different singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are, in principle, chemically non-equivalent. However, accidental equivalence is common. The spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This fits.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons on the ethyl groups will be split by their neighbors. The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. The problem states that all alkyl signals are *singlets*, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### **3. Test the Combinations in a 1:1 Mixture**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (options B, C, and D) to see which one matches the observed spectrum of the mixture.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   **Result:** Two singlets. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals correspond to 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets in total. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n    *   This combination is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Durene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   Prehnitene: one singlet (2H).\n        *   Isodurene: two singlets (1H each).\n        *   **Result:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces an NMR spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Verify the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, let's confirm that all the proposed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding four methyl groups (CH3) and removing four hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-4) + C4H(4*3) = C6H2 + C4H12 = **C10H14**. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-) fit this formula.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2):** The benzene ring core is C6. Adding two ethyl groups (C2H5) and removing two hydrogens (H) results in C6H(6-2) + C4H(2*5) = C6H4 + C4H10 = **C10H14**. This compound also fits the formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number and type of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (para substitution).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons (at positions 2, 3, 5, 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the two methylene (-CH2-) protons are split by the three methyl (-CH3) protons, resulting in a **quartet** (4H total). The three methyl protons are split by the two methylene protons, resulting in a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since the experimental spectrum shows only singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric (possesses a center of inversion and two mirror planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H). (Although they are ortho-coupled, in such a symmetrical environment, they often appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other, but different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (ratio 1:1).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 singlets in total.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. This produces **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique and lie on the axis of symmetry, making them inequivalent to each other and to the other methyls. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 singlets in total.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nThe experimental spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n2.  **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options (A, B, C).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two of these will result in two aromatic singlets (assuming different chemical shifts), each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to 1:1. Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any combination of these three isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check (The Deciding Factor):** We need to find a combination of alkyl signals that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 relative integration. For a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio on an integral of 24 means the actual proton counts for the three signals must be:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    So we are looking for a combination that produces three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    Let's combine the predicted alkyl signals for each pair:\n\n    *   **A) Prehnitene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Prehnitene: Two singlets (6H, 6H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This would give between 3 to 5 signals depending on overlaps, but the integrals (6, 6, 6, 3, 3) cannot be combined to give (12, 6, 6). So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Durene + Isodurene:**\n        *   Durene: One singlet (12H)\n        *   Isodurene: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)\n        *   Combined: This gives four singlets with integrals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This is not three signals. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) Durene + Prehnitene:**\n        *   Durene: **One singlet (12H)**\n        *   Prehnitene: **Two singlets (6H, 6H)**\n        *   Combined: This mixture gives exactly **three singlets** with integrals of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both signals are **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons producing these signals have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The signals are in a **1:1 ratio**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (around 2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three signals are **singlets**. This indicates they are from methyl (-CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (e.g., attached to the aromatic ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   The signals are in a **2:1:1 ratio**, based on their integration (the area under the peak).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine how many unique proton environments exist.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. There's a horizontal and a vertical plane of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry. In theory, all positions are unique. However, due to accidental overlap of signals (as confirmed by spectral databases), a simplified spectrum is observed.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** While there are four methyl groups, two of them are accidentally equivalent in chemical shift. This results in **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **6H, 3H, and 3H** (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**. (Although adjacent, their equivalence means they don't split each other).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are chemically equivalent and produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups produce a **quartet** (from the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (from the -CH3-). They are not singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations based on the options to see which mixture produces the observed spectrum. We are looking for a mixture that gives **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** (1 singlet from the first) + (3 singlets from the second) = **4 total alkyl singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two singlets**. Since both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, the integral ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-isomer contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-isomer contributes two singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three singlets**. The integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **This option perfectly explains the entire spectrum.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have all singlet alkyl signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** (1 singlet from the first) + (2 singlets from the second) = **3 total aromatic singlets**. This does not match the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
