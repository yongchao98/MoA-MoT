This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom is unaffected and remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Note: If we number the triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -H⁺   (d)C-------C\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate A: 3-deuterobenzyne)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -d⁺   (H)C-------C(H)\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate B: benzyne)\n        ```\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. Attack can occur at either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne B (benzyne):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion intermediate, which upon protonation gives the same final product.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to one carbon of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide anion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker and break more quickly than C-D bonds).\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this pathway and remains in the molecule.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Although slower, it is still possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide anion (:NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position).\n    *   So, this pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This creates a carbanion at C2. Protonation by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C2:** This creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n    *   So, this pathway produces only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified the following unique organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nThese three molecules are structurally distinct isomers. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium in this intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n    *   Pathway B yields one product: aniline.\n    *   Since all three of these molecules are structurally different, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways can occur, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds, so this pathway is slower, but it still occurs).\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position, the deuterium atom is at C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of this symmetric benzyne.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2, which is then protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH₂ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\n        So, Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2 is also possible, although slower. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 (Minor Pathway)**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.

This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne A (deuterated)**\n        *   The benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, with a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile :NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields a product with -NH2 at C1 and -D at C2. This is **aniline-2-d**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields a product with -NH2 at C6, -H at C1, and -D at C2. If we renumber this molecule starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1', the deuterium atom is at position C3'. This product is **aniline-3-d**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields two distinct products: aniline-2-d and aniline-3-d.\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne B (non-deuterated)**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium. The nucleophile :NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The -NH2 group attaches to C2. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B yields only one product: aniline.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic products:\n    1.  Aniline-2-d (from Pathway A)\n    2.  Aniline-3-d (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    Thus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aryl halide with a deuterium label at an ortho position.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    5.  This creates an unsymmetrical benzyne intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this step.\n    5.  This creates a symmetrical benzyne intermediate: **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**3. Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the nucleophilic attack of another amide ion (NH2⁻) on the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C2, no D).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to a carbanion at C2, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Attack at C2 leads to a carbanion at C1, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway A (3-Deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C6, with a D at C2).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to different products.\n    *   **Attack at C1:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1.\n        2.  A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        3.  The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        4.  **Product 2: 2-deuteroaniline**\n    *   **Attack at C6:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6.\n        2.  A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        3.  The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2.\n        4.  To name this molecule, we number the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1. In this case, the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        5.  **Product 3: 3-deuteroaniline**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2. The other ortho position to the bromine, C6, has a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide anion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia serves as the solvent.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 (with a deuterium, D) and C6 (with a hydrogen, H).\n    *   This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, breaking a C-H bond is significantly faster than breaking an equivalent C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *   This is the **minor** pathway due to the slower rate of C-D bond cleavage.\n\n*   **Stage 2: Addition of the nucleophile to the benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A negative charge develops on C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A negative charge develops on C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different deuterated anilines.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is standard benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to either C1 or C2. The adjacent carbon becomes negatively charged and is protonated by NH3. In both cases, the final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, the minor pathway produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n**3. Summary of Possible Products:**\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we get three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of *possible* organic products, we must consider the products from both the major and minor pathways. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction type.**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine (Br) atom, and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium (D) atom. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Elimination-Addition (Benzyne mechanism). The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the strong base to initiate the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe benzyne intermediate is formed by the elimination of HBr (or in this case, HBr or DBr). The amide ion abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n1.  **Position C-2:** This carbon has a deuterium (D) atom.\n2.  **Position C-6:** This carbon has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C-6 or the deuteron from C-2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The resulting intermediate is a benzyne molecule where the deuterium atom is still at position C-2. This is called **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-H bond, which is generally faster than breaking a C-D bond (due to the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-D bond, which is slower than breaking a C-H bond. This is the **minor** pathway, but it is still possible and will lead to a product.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic addition to the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (2-deuterobenzyne, from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium is at C-2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C-1', so the original C-2 (with D) is now C-3'. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne, from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at either C-1 or C-2 of the triple bond, but since the molecule is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 (or C-2):** The NH2 group attaches, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated. The final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of possible organic products.**\nBy considering both the major and minor pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C6H5NH2)\n2.  2-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D ortho to NH2)\n3.  3-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D meta to NH2)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must count all chemically distinct molecules that can be formed, even those from minor pathways. Therefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia (NH₃). The amide ion (⁻NH₂) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from one of the positions ortho to the bromine atom.\n\nThe structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is:\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H)\n   ||  ||\n  (H)C--C(H)\n     \\ /\n      C\n     (H)\n```\nThe positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n*   C2 is substituted with deuterium (D).\n*   C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction is still possible. The question asks for all *possible* products.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a normal, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, we have two different benzyne intermediates formed in the first step.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (⁻NH₂). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n**Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The two carbons of the triple bond, C1 and C6, are not equivalent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n**Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of ⁻NH₂ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbon, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify all the unique organic products that can be formed.\n\n1.  From Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):\n    *   2-deuterioaniline\n    *   3-deuterioaniline\n2.

This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2.

This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH₂ is a classic benzyne reaction. It occurs in two main steps:\n    *   **Elimination:** The strong base abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the halide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n    *   **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, the amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Elimination Step for 1-bromobenzene-2-d:**\n    The bromine atom is at C1. The *ortho* positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these *ortho* positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.

This set of reagents is a classic condition for the reaction to proceed via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d), an isotope of hydrogen, is at position 2. A normal hydrogen atom (H) is at position 6.\n    *   Reagents: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH2-) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds via a two-step elimination-addition mechanism.\n    *   **Step 1 (Elimination):** The strong base, NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The amide base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is retained in this intermediate.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-HBr)--> 3-d-benzyne` (The deuterium is at position 3 relative to the new triple bond).\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-DBr)--> benzyne` (non-deuterated).\n    *   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and will be the major pathway. However, Pathway B (abstraction of D) is still possible and will occur to a lesser extent. Consequently, **two different benzyne intermediates** will be formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Addition Step for Each Intermediate:**\n    *   **Step 2 (Addition):** The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-d-benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2- attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2, which are ortho to each other).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2- attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2; relative to the NH2 group, the D is in the meta position).\n        *   So, Pathway A produces two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we get a mixture of three different organic molecules:\n        1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n        2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a substituted halobenzene with sodium amide in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH₂⁻).\n\n**2. The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates):**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base and abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6:**\n    The C6 position has a hydrogen atom. The amide ion can abstract this proton (H⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] + NH₃`\n    This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a benzyne intermediate. The new triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] → 3-deuterobenzyne + Br⁻`\n    The intermediate is named 3-deuterobenzyne because the deuterium is at position 3 relative to the benzyne triple bond (C1-C6).\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2:**\n    The C2 position has a deuterium atom. The amide ion can also abstract this deuteron (D⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] + NH₂D`\n    This is kinetically slower than abstracting a proton due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond). However, it is still a possible pathway.\n    Following the abstraction, the bromide ion is eliminated, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] → benzyne + Br⁻`\n    In this case, the deuterium atom has been removed from the ring, so the intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Path A) and **benzyne** (from Path B).\n\n**3. The Addition Step (Formation of Products):**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has -NH₂ at C1 and D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has -NH₂ at C6 and D at C2. This molecule is **3-deuteroaniline** (the -NH₂ and D are in a 1,3 relationship).\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by NH₃, the resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Path A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine all possible products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), a powerful base, abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. This leads to two distinct pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of the proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n    2.  This carbanion then triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(H+ removal from C6)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> 3-deuterobenzyne\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible reaction).\n    2.  This carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(D+ removal from C2)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n    ```\n\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium atom at C2. Therefore, the attack of NH2⁻ can occur at two different sites, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C6 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the -D group at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the -D group at C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature (where the -NH2 group defines C1), this is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2 of a symmetrical C6H4 ring. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbanion, leads to the same single product. Since the deuterium was lost in the formation of this intermediate, the product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from the benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, the abstraction of the proton from C6 will be faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is kinetically favored.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the adjacent C1 position.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where a triple bond exists between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C2 (Minor Pathway)**\n        1.

The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, another amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This creates a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6.

NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH2⁻). Liquid ammonia acts as the solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step elimination-addition mechanism involving a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe base can abstract a particle from either position, leading to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Abstraction of H from C6):**\n    *   The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Abstraction of D from C2):**\n    *   Although less likely, it is still possible for the NH2⁻ base to abstract the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (NH2⁻). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond.

The bromine atom is the leaving group. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n\n    ```\n        Br\n       / \\\n    (D)C--C(H)\n     //  \\\\\n   (H)C--C(H)\n       \\ /\n        C\n       (H)\n    ```\n    The positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n2.  **Two Possible Elimination Pathways:** The amide ion can abstract either the hydrogen from C6 or the deuterium from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than abstracting a deuteron (D⁺) due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This abstraction is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), will now attack the benzyne intermediates.

The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group as C1, the deuterium is at the C3 position.

This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a negative charge forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at the original C6 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position.

Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (Br), and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism has two main steps:\n    1.  **Elimination:** The strong base (amide ion, NH2-) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n    2.  **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, another amide ion, NH2-) attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia) to give the final product.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-) can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of the two positions ortho to the bromine atom at C1: C2 (which has a deuterium) or C6 (which has a hydrogen). This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the deuteron (D+) from the C2 position.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    5.  Crucially, since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting benzyne intermediate contains only hydrogen atoms (C6H4). Let's call this **Benzyne-H**.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes D+ at C2)--> Benzyne-H (C6H4)`\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the proton (H+) from the C6 position. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    5.  In this pathway, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. The resulting benzyne intermediate is therefore deuterated. Let's call this **Benzyne-D**. Relative to the triple bond (C1-C6), the deuterium is at the C2 position.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes H+ at C6)--> Benzyne-D (C6H3D)`\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, the nucleophile (NH2-) attacks each of these benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-H (from Pathway A):**\n    1.  Benzyne-H (C6H4) is symmetrical. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2 of the benzyne triple bond. Both attacks lead to the same carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent (NH3), which donates a proton (H+).\n    3.  The final product is **aniline (C6H5NH2)**. Since the starting benzyne had no deuterium, the final product has no deuterium.\n\n    `Benzyne-H + NH2- --> Aryl anion --> +NH3 --> Aniline`\n    This gives **Product 1: Aniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-D (from Pathway B):**\n    1.  Benzyne-D is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    2.  **Attack at C1:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C6.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium (D) at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    3.  **Attack at C6:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C1.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium (D) at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    `Benzyne-D + NH2- --> two possible aryl anions --> +NH3 --> 2-deuteroaniline + 3-deuteroaniline`\n    This gives **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline** and **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem describes the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine all possible products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (:NH2-), being a strong base, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   C-2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C-6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C-1 position.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C-2.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-2.\n    3.  This intermediate eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C-1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Importantly, since the deuterium atom was abstracted, this benzyne intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne** (it contains no deuterium).\n\nSo, we have two distinct benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deuteriobenzyne and unlabeled benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1, creating a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6, creating a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2, which are meta to each other).\n\n*   **Products from unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetric benzyne. Attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent. Since this intermediate has no deuterium, the final product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products are formed:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the D-abstraction pathway)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, and then addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Reaction from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by ammonia (NH3) yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by ammonia yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Reaction from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is the simple, unsubstituted benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of the same product after protonation. The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Summary of Products:**\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers).

Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine (Br) atom is at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This is a very strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) used in a polar solvent.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This forms a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This forms a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate** (regular benzyne).\n\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and occurs faster than Pathway B (abstraction of D). However, both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n**4. Step 2: Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon atom of the benzyne \"triple bond\".\n\n*   **Addition to the Deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A negative charge forms on C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A negative charge forms on C1, which is protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces **two different deuterated products**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    *   This intermediate is simply benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. Regardless of where it attacks, the subsequent protonation results in the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B produces **one non-deuterated product**.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial elimination pathways, we identify three unique organic products that can be formed:\n\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n            1.

This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you renumber the benzyne so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the deuterium is on C3).\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2.** Although slower than H-abstraction, this pathway is still possible.\n            1.

Sodium amide is a very strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate. Aromatic halides that lack strong electron-withdrawing groups do not undergo standard nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr). Instead, in the presence of a very strong base like NaNH2, they undergo elimination followed by addition.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the elimination step (formation of benzyne).**\n    The amide ion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Both D at C2 and H at C6 can be abstracted by the amide ion, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2.**\n        The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard benzyne (C6H4), which has no deuterium.\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -D+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate A) Benzyne\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6.**\n        The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the benzene ring. The resulting intermediate is a deuterated benzyne, specifically 3-deuterobenzyne (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 2 relative to C1, which is position 3 on the new benzyne ring system).\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -H+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate B) 3-Deuterobenzyne\n\n    *Note on Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):* The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so abstraction of the proton from C6 (Pathway B) is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 (Pathway A). However, the question asks for the number of *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is favored.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the addition step for each benzyne intermediate.**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (Benzyne):**\n        Benzyne is symmetrical. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond. Both attacks, after protonation, lead to the same product: aniline.\n\n        Benzyne + NH2- -> Anion -> +NH3 -> **Product 1: Aniline (C6H5NH2)**\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (3-Deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is not symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields 2-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are ortho to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C1; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline**\n\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 at C1 yields 3-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are meta to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C6; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\n    From the two possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H⁺) from C6 than the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This phenomenon is known as a **primary kinetic isotope effect**.\n    *   However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the H⁺ from C6.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected.\n        5.  This forms **Intermediate I: 3-deuteriobenzyne**. (The benzyne triple bond is between C1-C6, and the D is at C2, which is position 3 relative to the new C1=C6 double bond if we renumber). This is the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the D⁺ from C2.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule.\n        5.  This forms **Intermediate II: Benzyne** (with no deuterium). This is the minor pathway.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, NH2⁻, now attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate I (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This places the NH2 group at C1 and creates a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives the final product where NH2 is at C1 and D is at C2. This is **Product 1: 2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This places the NH2 group at C6 and creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation gives the final product where NH2 is at C6 and D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to place the NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **Product 2: 3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate II (Benzyne):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since the intermediate is symmetric and has no deuterium, attack at either position followed by protonation leads to the same product.\n        *   The final product is **Product 3: Aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction leads to the formation of three distinct organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from major intermediate I)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from major intermediate I)\n    3.  Aniline (from minor intermediate II)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position, C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This combination is a very strong base and is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne):**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (d).\n        *   Position C6, which has a regular hydrogen (H).\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Removal of Hydrogen from C6**\n    *   The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    *   The carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne** (if you number the triple bond carbons 1 and 2, the deuterium is on carbon 3). Let's call this **Intermediate A**.\n\n4.  **Pathway B: Removal of Deuteron from C2**\n    *   The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. This is a slower process due to the stronger C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), but it is still a possible pathway.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    *   The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed.\n    *   The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**. Let's call this **Intermediate B**.\n\n5.  **The Addition Step (Attack on Benzyne Intermediates):**\n    *   Now, the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n6.  **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The two carbons of the triple bond are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃) to give the final product. The NH₂ group is at C1, and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation gives a product where the NH₂ group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products.\n\n7.  **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This benzyne is symmetrical.\n    *   Attack by NH₂⁻ can occur at C1 or C2. Since they are equivalent, both attacks lead to the same result.\n    *   For instance, attack at C1 forms a carbanion at C2. Protonation by the solvent (which contains only regular hydrogen) results in a product with the NH₂ group at C1. This product is simply **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), with no deuterium.\n    *   So, Pathway B leads to one distinct product.\n\n8.  **Count the Total Number of Unique Products:**\n    *   From Pathway A: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n    *   From Pathway B: Aniline.\n\n    All three of these molecules are structurally different. Therefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. These are characteristic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), will abstract an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The most acidic protons are those *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's label the carbons for clarity: Bromine is on C1, and Deuterium (d or D) is on C2.\n        ```\n             Br\n            / \\\n          (C1)-(C2)D\n         //   \\\\\n       H(C6)   (C3)H\n        |     |\n       H(C5)---(C4)H\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        ```\n    *   The positions ortho to the bromine at C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   There are two possible protons (one is actually a deuteron) that can be removed by the base:\n        *   **Path A: Abstraction of the hydrogen (H) at C6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this abstraction is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). The base removes H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6. This anion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Path B: Abstraction of the deuterium (D) at C2.** Although slower than Path A, this pathway is still possible. The base removes D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. This anion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the parent **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile is the amide ion (NH2⁻), which is present in the solution. It will attack the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between the original C1 and C6 carbons, and a deuterium on the original C2 carbon.\n        *   The nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks the carbon that was originally C1, the new C-N bond forms there. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks the carbon that was originally C6, the new C-N bond forms there. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   These two products, 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline, are distinct constitutional isomers.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate 2 (parent benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n        *   The nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond. Due to symmetry, this leads to the same intermediate anion.\n        *   This anion is then protonated by the solvent, NH3. Since the starting benzyne had no deuterium, and it is protonated by regular ammonia, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    *   Based on the two possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n        1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n        2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n### **1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) is at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent and Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH2⁻, is the active species), and liquid ammonia is a polar solvent.\n\n### **2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide that has a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent (ortho) to the halogen-bearing carbon with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, commonly known as the **benzyne mechanism**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Mechanism**\n\n#### **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from one of the ortho positions (C-2 or C-6) to the bromine atom. This is the elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a proton (H⁺) from the C-6 position.\n    2.  This is generally the faster process due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, as the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-6. This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  The result is the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called a benzyne. In this case, a triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a deuteron (D⁺) from the C-2 position.\n    2.  This process is slower than H⁺ abstraction but is still possible.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-2, which then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was abstracted from C-2, the resulting benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atom. This is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the solution, the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the electrophilic carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is the addition step. After the attack, the resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. These two positions are not equivalent because of the adjacent deuterium at C-2.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This creates a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This creates a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2. By IUPAC nomenclature (numbering from the -NH2 group), this is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n\n     \n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2, and there is no deuterium.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation by NH3, leads to the same single product. This product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the two possible initial elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we find three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nLet's break down the reaction mechanism step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d\nThe structure has a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.\n\n```\n      Br\n     /\n    (1)C--C(2)-D\n   //    \\\\\n(6)C-H    C(3)-H\n  |       |\n(5)C-H--C(4)-H\n```\n\n**Reagent:** NaNH2 in liquid NH3. The active species is the strong base, amide anion (NH2⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this process and remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway A)\n      ...H at C6 abstracted... --> [3-deuteriobenzyne]\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway B)\n      ...D at C2 abstracted... --> [benzyne]\n    ```\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The 3-deuteriobenzyne intermediate is asymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. These groups are ortho to each other. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. These groups are meta to each other. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The standard benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same product.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2 group attaches to one carbon, and a proton from NH3 attaches to the other. Since there is no deuterium on this intermediate, the final product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find that three different organic products can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, including the effect of isotopic labeling.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3) is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide anion (NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The positions ortho to the bromine atom at C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base abstracts the proton (H+) from C6. This is kinetically favored over abstracting a deuteron (D+) because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   Abstraction of H+ from C6 creates a carbanion at C6.\n        *   This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base abstracts the deuteron (D+) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   Abstraction of D+ from C2 creates a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    *   Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile in the reaction is the amide anion (NH2-). It attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C6, with a D at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2- attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2- attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. Relative to the -NH2 group at C6 (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from benzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated benzyne.\n        *   Attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2 of the benzyne, followed by protonation, leads to the same product: **aniline**.\n        *   So, the minor intermediate (benzyne) leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    The question asks for the number of *possible* organic products. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we have identified three distinct products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nSince all three products are mechanistically possible, even though they will be formed in different amounts, the total number of possible organic products is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium (D).\n    *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    The base can abstract either H or D, leading to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this process is kinetically favored (faster). This is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE).\n        *   Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6 followed by the loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**. This is the **major** intermediate.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. This is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but still possible because NaNH₂ is a very strong base.\n        *   Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2 followed by the loss of Br⁻ from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n        *   The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. This is the **minor** intermediate.\n        *   A byproduct of this pathway is deuterated ammonia (NH₂D), which will be present in the solvent mixture.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻) or ammonia (NH₃), then attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃) to give the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from major Pathway A):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-1, a carbanion is formed at C-6. This anion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-6, a carbanion is formed at C-1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. When we renumber the ring to place the -NH₂ group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n    *   **Addition to non-deuterated benzyne (from minor Pathway B):**\n        This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ group attacks the benzyne, and the resulting carbanion is quenched by an acidic species in the solvent. The solvent contains a large amount of NH₃ and a small amount of NH₂D (formed during Pathway B).\n        *   **Protonation by NH₃:** The carbanion abstracts a proton from the abundant NH₃ solvent. The final product has no deuterium. This product is **aniline**.\n        *   **Deuteronation by NH₂D:** The carbanion could abstract a deuteron from the NH₂D present. This would place a deuterium atom on the ring ortho to the -NH₂ group. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Tally of Unique Products:**\n    Let's list all the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways:\n    1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A and Pathway B)\n    2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\n    Combining the products from both the major and minor pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2⁻).\n    *   This combination of a substituted benzene with a leaving group (Br) and a very strong base points to an **elimination-addition reaction mechanism**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible, parallel elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Removal of H⁺ from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored (faster).\n        *   The electron pair from the C-H bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Removal of D⁺ from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond. However, it is still a possible reaction.\n        *   The electron pair from the C-D bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate has no deuterium atoms. It is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n         \n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Amide to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2⁻) now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation of the resulting carbanion by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond. These two attacks lead to different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A negative charge develops at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A negative charge develops at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ attacks the symmetrical benzyne intermediate.\n        *   The -NH2 group adds to one carbon of the triple bond (e.g., C1), and the other carbon (C2) is protonated.\n        *   The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    The reaction produces a mixture of all possible products from both pathways. The unique organic products formed are:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nThese three are distinct chemical compounds (isomers or different molecular formulas). Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThis question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This means we have a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. There is also a hydrogen atom (H) at position 6. Both positions 2 and 6 are *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n```\n      Br (at C1)\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H) (at C6)\n   ||  ||\n   ...\n```\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (Br⁻). There are two possibilities:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C-6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 to form a benzyne intermediate. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is favored and will be the major pathway.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. Let's call this **Benzyne A**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C-2 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1. This pathway is disfavored due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This benzyne does not contain a deuterium atom, as it was removed in this step. Let's call this **Benzyne B**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH₂⁻), will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6, D at C2):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-1. A negative charge develops on C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product has the NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-6. A negative charge develops on C-1, which is protonated. If we number the final product with the NH₂ group at the #1 position, the original C-6 is now C-1, and the original C-2 (where the deuterium is) is now C-3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2, no D):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The NH₂⁻ group can attack either C-1 or C-2 of the benzyne triple bond. Since this benzyne is symmetrical (ignoring the other ring protons) and contains no deuterium, attack at either position, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Organic Products**\nBased on the two possible benzyne intermediates, we have identified three different possible organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers/regioisomers). Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide (like bromobenzene) with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr in this case). The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the H from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains untouched at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne-1**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the D from C2 (this is slower but still occurs).\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C2, which expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. Let's call this **Benzyne-2**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The nucleophile is the amide ion (:NH2-). After the addition, the resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne-1 (asymmetric):**\n        Benzyne-1 is asymmetric because of the deuterium at C2. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 (by NH3) adds an H atom. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**. (**Product 1**)\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 adds an H atom. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C6 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position. For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C1. The deuterium is then at C3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**. (**Product 2**)\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne-2 (symmetric):**\n        Benzyne-2 is the standard, non-substituted benzyne. It is symmetric. Attack of the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 will lead to the same final product after protonation.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to the benzene ring, and an H atom is added to the adjacent carbon. The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**. (**Product 3**)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two atoms at the ortho positions (C2 and C6): a deuterium (D) at C2 and a hydrogen (H) at C6.\n    *   The amide base can abstract either the proton (H) from C6 or the deuteron (D) from C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH2- removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   (This pathway is kinetically favored due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, as the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH2- removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.

This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent and Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** Aryl halides treated with a very strong base like NaNH2 undergo an elimination-addition reaction via a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The strong base, amide ion (:NH2-), can abstract a proton from either of these positions. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        3.  This carbanion rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this pathway. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If we number the triple bond carbons as 1 and 2, the deuterium is on the 3rd carbon).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D+) from C2.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n    In the second step, the nucleophile (:NH2-) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If the :NH2- group adds to C1, a carbanion forms at C6. After protonation (with H from NH3), the final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If the :NH2- group adds to C6, a carbanion forms at C1. After protonation, the final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the D atom at C2. The relative positions are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Pathway A yields **two** distinct products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack by :NH2- at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) leads to the same carbanion intermediate, which upon protonation gives the same final product.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2), with no deuterium.\n        *   Pathway B yields only **one** product.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    Since both elimination pathways are possible (even though one is faster than the other), we must consider the products from both benzyne intermediates. The possible organic products are:\n    1.  2-Deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-Deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    These three products are all structurally distinct molecules. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The two ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a positive ion from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate where a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, this is the major pathway.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C2**\n        *   The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2, which then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, this intermediate is the normal, **undeuterated benzyne**.\n        *   This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the KIE, so it's the minor pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider it.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (⁻NH₂), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate I (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2. The two ends of the triple bond (C1 and C6) are not equivalent.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway A leads to **two** different products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate II (Undeuterated Benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of the ⁻NH₂ nucleophile on either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields the same single product.\n        *   The product is normal, undeuterated **aniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway B leads to **one** product.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n    1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\n    Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis is an organic chemistry question that involves the benzyne mechanism, a type of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition pathway.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d) at position 2. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. The active species is the amide anion (:NH₂⁻).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism (Elimination-Addition)**\nThe strong amide base will initiate an elimination reaction to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne. This is followed by an addition reaction where the amide anion acts as a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide base abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6:** has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract from either position, leading to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from carbon C-6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C-6 attacks C-1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is not involved in this step and remains in the molecule. We can call this intermediate **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *Note: This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).*\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2**\n    1.

This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSince both pathways are possible, we will have a mixture of two different benzyne intermediates: **2-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 4: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack**\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 2-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃.

A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3.

Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, it is easier and faster to break the C-H bond. However, breaking the C-D bond is also possible. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new strained triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n        4.  **Intermediate I:** 2-deuteriobenzyne (with the triple bond between C1 and C6).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.

This is a slower process than abstracting H⁺ but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2, making them *meta* to each other).\n        *   So, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation gives a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B yields one product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   Combining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n        1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    *   These are three structurally distinct organic molecules. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   The C6 position, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, both reactions are possible. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway)**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This elimination results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where a new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway)**\n    *   Less frequently, the amide ion can remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   The resulting benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**. The removed deuterium ends up forming deuterated ammonia (NH₂D).\n\n     \n\n5.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n6.  **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. Numbering the ring starting from the -NH₂ group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces two distinct isomers: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n     \n\n7.  **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne)**\n    *   The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same initial carbanion (o-aminophenyl anion).\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n    *   The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   (Note: The aminophenyl anion could also be deuterated by the NH₂D formed in this pathway, which would lead to 2-deuterioaniline. However, this is a product already accounted for in Pathway A. The new, unique product from this pathway is aniline.)\n\n     \n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of three structurally distinct organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    *   Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, which means we must consider all chemically viable pathways, even those that are slower.\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with no activating groups, very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base, abstracting an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and is cleaved more readily than the C-D bond. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Consequently, Pathway A (H abstraction) will be significantly faster and thus the major pathway, while Pathway B (D abstraction) will be slower and the minor pathway. However, since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all chemically feasible pathways, even the minor ones.\n\nTherefore, **two different benzyne intermediates** are formed in the reaction: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and unlabeled benzyne (minor).\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the newly formed benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) can also act as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields a product with an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. To name this compound, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, so C6 becomes C1'. In this new numbering, the deuterium is at C3'. The product is **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) gives **two distinct products**.\n\n*   **Attack on unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. It is symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **1-aminobenzene** (or aniline).\n    *   Thus, the minor intermediate (benzyne) gives only **one product**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three unique organic molecules:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  1-aminobenzene (aniline)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis is a classic problem involving the benzyne mechanism in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine (Br) at position C1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions: C6 (bearing a hydrogen, H) and C2 (bearing a deuterium, D). This leads to two competing pathways for the initial elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a **3-deuteriobenzyne** intermediate. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at position C2.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ attacks C1. The resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups are adjacent.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ attacks C6. The resulting carbanion is at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups have a meta relationship.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Summary of Products**\nBy considering both pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n    *   The reaction is an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. This is a characteristic reaction of aryl halides with strong bases.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s):**\n    The mechanism begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base to abstract a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to C1: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6.**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ base removes the H atom from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Let's visualize it: The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2.**\n        *   Although slower, it is still possible for the NH₂⁻ base to remove the deuteron from C2.\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C2.\n        *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this pathway, the deuterium atom has been removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is **undeuterated benzyne** (the standard C₆H₄ benzyne).\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and undeuterated benzyne.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃), to yield the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2.\n        *   Attack at C1: If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, the new NH₂ group is adjacent to the deuterium atom at C2. After protonation, the product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, the new NH₂ group is *meta* to the deuterium atom at C2. After protonation, the product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Therefore, the deuterated benzyne intermediate leads to two different, isomeric products.\n\n    *   **Addition to undeuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond, but because of the symmetry, both attacks lead to the same product after protonation: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n        *   Therefore, the undeuterated benzyne intermediate leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    No other isomers, such as 4-deuteroaniline, can be formed through this mechanism.\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents and reactants points to a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The two ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   Position C2 is substituted with deuterium (d).\n*   Position C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also possible and represents a minor pathway. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n**Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by ammonia. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. When numbering the aniline product, the -NH2 group is at position 1, making this **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\nSo, the major pathway (A) leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n**Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate at either C1 or C2.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. The carbanion at C2 is protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH2 group adds to C2. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\nSo, the minor pathway (B) leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This specific set of reactants points to an elimination-addition mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and its isotope, deuterium (d), at position 2. The positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine are C2 and C6. C2 has a deuterium atom, and C6 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base, with the amide anion (:NH2-) being the active species. It is strong enough to deprotonate a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne Mechanism)**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-) acts as a base and removes a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In our starting material, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n        *   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n        The C-H bond is weaker and is broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways.\n\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion at C6 then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(H+ removal from C6)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> 3-Deuterobenzyne\n            ```\n\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(D+ removal from C2)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n            ```\n        So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-), which also acts as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n        *   **Reaction of 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n            The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either C1 or C6. These two attacks are not equivalent and lead to different products.\n            1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n            2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n            Thus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate yields two distinct products.\n\n        *   **Reaction of Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n            This is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Attack by NH2- can occur at C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n3.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nThis question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction under conditions that favor a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (via Benzyne)**\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step mechanism: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, followed by the addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium (D).\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen (H).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Crucially, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this pathway. Let's call this **Benzyne-I**. This intermediate has only hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. (Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the lighter proton is faster than the heavier deuteron, so this pathway is favored, but both occur).\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  This intermediate expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. Let's call this **Benzyne-II**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). It will attack the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-I (No Deuterium):**\n    *   Benzyne-I has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The NH₂⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetric (unsubstituted benzyne), attack at either carbon followed by protonation leads to the same product.\n    *   **Product 1:** Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-II (Deuterium at C2):**\n    *   Benzyne-II has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6. These are no longer equivalent positions because of the nearby deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Product 2:** 2-deuteroaniline (or *ortho*-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-NH₂). Thus, C6 becomes the new C1, and the original C2 (with the deuterium) becomes the new C3.\n        *   **Product 3:** 3-deuteroaniline (or *meta*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through two different benzyne intermediates, which in turn lead to three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism (an elimination-addition reaction) and the effect of isotopic labeling.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. The other ortho position, C6, has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The strong base, amide anion (:NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   C2, which is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6, which is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.**\n        *   The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   `C6H5(Br at C1, D at C2) + :NH2- → [C6H4(Br at C1, D at C2, anion at C6)]- + NH3`\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C6 then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   `[C6H4(Br,D,-)]- → Intermediate I + Br-`\n        *   **Intermediate I** is a benzyne molecule where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.**\n        *   The base abstracts the deuteron (D+) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A.\n        *   `C6H5(Br at C1, D at C2) + :NH2- → [C6H4(Br at C1, anion at C2)]- + NH2D`\n        *   The deuterium is removed from the ring and becomes part of an aminodeuterium molecule (NH2D).\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   `[C6H4(Br,-)]- → Intermediate II + Br-`\n        *   **Intermediate II** is a benzyne molecule where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was abstracted in its formation, this is a normal, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then immediately protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate I (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The D is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **aniline-2-d** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 at C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2. If we number the final product starting from the -NH2 group as position 1, the D is at position 3. This is **aniline-3-d** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Thus, Intermediate I produces two distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate II (Benzyne):**\n        *   This is a normal benzyne intermediate with no deuterium. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n        *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2. Both attacks lead to an anilide anion, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        *   Regardless of whether the attack is at C1 or C2, the final product is normal, unlabeled **aniline**.\n        *   Thus, Intermediate II produces one organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    Combining the products from both pathways, we have three chemically distinct organic molecules that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline-2-d (from Pathway A)\n    2.  Aniline-3-d (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the hydrogen atom (H) from C6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is faster.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n        3.  The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n        1.  Although slower, it is also possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron (d) from C2.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuteriobenzyne and regular benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Attack by Nucleophile)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to 2-deuteriobenzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate (triple bond between C1-C6, D at C2) is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C1 and the deuterium at the original C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C6 and the deuterium at the original C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium atom is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Addition to benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n        *   Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by the solvent (NH3), the same single product is formed: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n    1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C1)\n    2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C6)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem asks for the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH2). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### **2. Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's draw it and number the carbons:\n\n```\n      D(2)\n     /\nBr(1)-C===C\n    |   |\n  H(6)-C---C-H(3)\n     \\  /\n      C==C\n      |  |\n      H(5) H(4)\n```\n\nThe positions ortho to the bromine at C-1 are C-2 and C-6.\n*   C-2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   C-6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe amide base can abstract a cation from either of these positions, leading to two different elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6**\n    The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, and subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major pathway**.\n    The elimination of H from C-6 and Br from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium at C-2 is unaffected. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2**\n    The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C-1. This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond but still occurs. This is the **minor pathway**.\n    When the deuteron is abstracted from C-2, it is removed from the molecule. The resulting triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The intermediate is the normal, undeuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n### **3. Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which will add to the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium is at C-2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. The resulting carbanion at C-6 is protonated by NH₃. The product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6. The resulting carbanion at C-1 is protonated. This places the -NH₂ group at C-6 relative to the deuterium at C-2. After renumbering to give the substituent the lowest number, this is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The intermediate is the symmetrical, undeuterated benzyne.\n    1.  **Attack at the triple bond:** The nucleophile NH₂⁻ adds to one of the carbons of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. Due to symmetry, the attack at either carbon leads to the same single product: **aniline** (undeuterated).\n\n### **4. Summary of Products**\n\nCombining all the possible products from both pathways:\n1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible, chemically distinct organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide anion (`NH2-`) abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position holds a deuterium atom (d).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The `NH2-` base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 attacks the C1-Br bond, causing the bromide ion (Br-) to be eliminated.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected and remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**. This pathway is favored due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, as a C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than a C-D bond.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (d+) from C2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 attacks the C1-Br bond, eliminating the bromide ion (Br-).\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (`NH2-`), which attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3) to yield the final aniline product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The `NH2-` can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The `NH2` group adds to C1. The subsequent protonation occurs at C6. The final product has the `-NH2` group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or *o*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The `NH2` group adds to C6. The subsequent protonation occurs at C1. The final product has the `-NH2` group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. The relationship between a substituent at C6 and one at C2 is *meta* (1,3 relationship). This product is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *m*-deuterioaniline).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (standard benzyne):**\n        This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this benzyne, attack by `NH2-` at C1 or C2 leads to the same product after protonation. The product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2), with no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering both possible reaction pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all structurally distinct molecules that can be formed, even if they are produced in different amounts. Therefore, there are three possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a source of the very strong base, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction conditions (an aryl halide with a strong base and no strongly electron-withdrawing groups) are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine at C1).\n    *   There are two *ortho* positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the deuteron from C2 or the proton from C6.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. A lone pair is formed on C6. This lone pair then forms a triple bond between C6 and C1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n        *   This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect, KIE). This will be the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The base can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. A lone pair forms on C2, which then forms a triple bond between C2 and C1, expelling the bromide ion.\n        *   The resulting intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** (C₆H₄).\n        *   This pathway is slower due to the KIE, but it is still a possible reaction, so it contributes to the pool of possible products.\n\n    *   Conclusion of Step 1: Two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deutero-benzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Reaction of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The highly reactive benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile. In this reaction, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻) also acts as the nucleophile. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Reaction of 3-deutero-benzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2.\n        *   The nucleophile (:NH₂⁻) can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. This carbanion is protonated by an ammonia molecule (NH₃). The product has an -NH₂ group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. This carbanion is protonated by NH₃. The product has an -NH₂ group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3.

NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (:NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    *   The base can abstract either the hydrogen from C6 or the deuterium from C2.\n        *   The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C6 will be the faster, major pathway.\n        *   However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also a possible, albeit slower, pathway.\n\n    *   This leads to the formation of **two different benzyne intermediates**:\n\n        *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n            1.  The amide ion removes H+ from C6.\n            2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n            3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a \"triple bond\" between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n             \n\n        *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n            1.  The amide ion removes D+ from C2.\n            2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n            3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a \"triple bond\" between C1 and C2.

The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D atom is at C2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 gives the final product. The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D atom is at C2. The NH2 and D groups are *meta* (in a 1,3 relationship) to each other.

The NH2- base removes the deuteron (D+) from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        3.  The result is the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The intermediate is benzyne. Since the deuterium was removed, the resulting benzyne has only hydrogen atoms attached to the ring carbons not involved in the triple bond.\n        4.  This pathway involves breaking a C-D bond, which is stronger than a C-H bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), this pathway is slower than the alternative.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.

This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with deuterium (d), an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne Mechanism)**\n\nThis reaction proceeds via a two-step mechanism:\n*   **Step 1: Elimination:** The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon. This is an E2-like elimination that forms a highly reactive intermediate called \"benzyne\".\n*   **Step 2: Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, another NH₂⁻ anion or the NH₃ solvent) attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's \"triple bond\". This is followed by protonation to yield the final product.\n\n**3. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nIn our starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two positions *ortho* to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position holds a regular hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This is generally faster than abstracting a deuteron (D⁺) because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    3.  The resulting carbanion at C6 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, it is still possible for the NH₂⁻ base to abstract the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, unsubstituted **benzyne**.\n\n**4. Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, we must consider the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to both of these intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The product has the NH₂ group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is protonated. The product has the NH₂ group at C6 and the D atom at C2. If we renumber the ring so the NH₂ group is at position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *Pathway A yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Products from Pathway B (from unsubstituted benzyne)**\n    The intermediate is symmetrical benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to symmetry, attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated. The resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), with no deuterium.\n    *Pathway B yields one distinct product.*\n\n**5. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we find three unique organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in total.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThis is a classic problem in organic chemistry involving an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.

The other ortho position (C-6) has a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction conditions (a substituted halobenzene with a very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via an **elimination-addition** mechanism, forming a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which holds a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which holds a hydrogen (H).\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstracting the proton (H) from C-6 is faster than abstracting the deuteron (D) from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. We must consider both pathways since the question asks for all *possible* products.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes H⁺ from C-6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you number the benzyne triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at position 3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes D⁺ from C-2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C-2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process. This intermediate is the parent, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1, and a carbanion forms at C-6. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6, and a carbanion forms at C-1. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion.\n        *   Protonation by the solvent (NH₃) gives a product with no deuterium. This product is simply **aniline**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline\n    3.  Aniline (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "This is a question in organic chemistry involving the reaction of an isotopically labeled aryl halide with a very strong base. To determine the most consistent answer, I will first synthesize a consensus reasoning based on the provided solutions, and then evaluate the final conclusions.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of the Reaction Mechanism:** All 60 provided answers correctly identify the reaction conditions: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is an aryl halide treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via a two-step **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. This core identification is completely consistent across all solutions.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The Elimination Step - Formation of Intermediates:**\n    *   All solutions correctly state that the strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   They all identify the two distinct ortho positions in 1-bromobenzene-2-d: C6 (which has a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (which has a deuterium atom, D).\n    *   Every solution correctly deduces that this leads to two competing elimination pathways, resulting in two different benzyne intermediates:\n        *   **Pathway A:** Abstraction of H from C6 leads to a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in this intermediate (**3-deuterobenzyne**).\n        *   **Pathway B:** Abstraction of D from C2 leads to a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the ring in this process, resulting in a standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n    *   This analysis, acknowledging the formation of two distinct intermediates, is perfectly consistent across all 60 examples. Many also correctly mention that Pathway A is kinetically favored due to the Kinetic Isotope Effect, but both pathways are possible.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The Addition Step - Formation of Products:**\n    *   All solutions correctly identify that the nucleophile (also the amide ion, NH₂⁻) then attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   For the intermediate from **Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**, every solution correctly notes that it is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to **two distinct deuterated products**: **2-deuteroaniline** and **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   For the intermediate from **Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne)**, every solution correctly notes that it is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to only **one product**: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Number of Products:**\n    *   Based on the perfectly consistent reasoning outlined above, all 60 candidate answers correctly conclude that the reaction produces a total of **three** unique organic molecules:\n        1.  Aniline\n        2.  2-deuteroaniline\n        3.  3-deuteroaniline\n    *   Therefore, the chemically correct answer is 3.\n\n### Selection of the Most Consistent Answer\n\nThe reasoning in all 60 provided answers is identical and leads to the same conclusion: there are 3 possible organic products. This represents an exceptionally high degree of consistency in the logical analysis. The inconsistencies appear only in the final tag (e.g., <<<D>>>, <<<A>>>), which seems to be a noisy artifact.\n\nSince the task is to select the *most consistent answer*, and the scientific reasoning is the core of the answer, the choice must reflect the unanimous conclusion of that reasoning.\n\nThe numerical answer is 3.

This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) from NaNH2 acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Because there are two different atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom is unaffected and remains at position C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (Note: If we number the triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -H⁺   (d)C-------C\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate A: 3-deuterobenzyne)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing a proton due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n        ```\n           Br              (triple bond)\n          / \\               /     \\\n        (d)C--C(H)  -d⁺   (H)C-------C(H)\n         ||  ||   ----->    ||       ||\n        (H)C--C(H)  -Br⁻    (H)C-------C(H)\n          \\ /                 \\     /\n           C(H)                  C(H)\n        (Reactant)       (Benzyne Intermediate B: benzyne)\n        ```\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        So, Pathway A leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne B (benzyne):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical.

These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide anion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are weaker and break more quickly than C-D bonds).\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this pathway and remains in the molecule.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    *   Although slower, it is still possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile, the amide anion (:NH2-), to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The -NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position).\n    *   So, this pathway produces two distinct products.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This creates a carbanion at C2. Protonation by NH3 yields **aniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C2:** This creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 also yields **aniline**.\n    *   So, this pathway produces only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Products**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified the following unique organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.

This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2.

The deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product where the -NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium in this intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n    *   Pathway B yields one product: aniline.\n    *   Since all three of these molecules are structurally different, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.

This is a very strong base.\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide that lacks activating groups with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C2**, which bears a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   **Position C6**, which bears a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2 is also possible, although slower. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 (Minor Pathway)**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is formed between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This intermediate is simply **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n         \n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Amination of the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to form the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the -D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the -D at C2. When we re-number the ring to give the -NH2 group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Thus, Pathway A leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n        *   Thus, Pathway B leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Unique Products**\n    *   Combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we have three structurally distinct (isotopically different) organic products:\n        1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n        2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Conditions:**\n    *   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the amide ion (:NH2-) acting as the active species.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The first step is the abstraction of a proton from a carbon *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon.

This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is kinetically favored over removing a deuteron because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        *   This is followed by the rapid elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The resulting intermediate is a benzyne where the deuterium atom is still attached at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne A (2-deuterio-1,6-didehydrobenzene)**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C2. This process is slower than abstracting a proton but is still possible with a strong base like NaNH2.\n        *   A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        *   This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2.

The resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **Benzyne B (1,2-didehydrobenzene)**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The second step is the nucleophilic attack of another amide ion (:NH2-) on the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne A (deuterated)**\n        *   The benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, with a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile :NH2- can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields a product with -NH2 at C1 and -D at C2. This is **aniline-2-d**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 yields a product with -NH2 at C6, -H at C1, and -D at C2. If we renumber this molecule starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1', the deuterium atom is at position C3'. This product is **aniline-3-d**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A yields two distinct products: aniline-2-d and aniline-3-d.\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne B (non-deuterated)**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium. The nucleophile :NH2- can attack either C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C2.

This is an aryl halide with a deuterium label at an ortho position.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    5.  This creates an unsymmetrical benzyne intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this step.\n    5.  This creates a symmetrical benzyne intermediate: **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**3. Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the nucleophilic attack of another amide ion (NH2⁻) on the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C2, no D).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to a carbanion at C2, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Attack at C2 leads to a carbanion at C1, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway A (3-Deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C6, with a D at C2).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to different products.\n    *   **Attack at C1:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1.\n        2.  A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        3.  The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        4.  **Product 2: 2-deuteroaniline**\n    *   **Attack at C6:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6.\n        2.

To name this molecule, we number the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1. In this case, the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        5.  **Product 3: 3-deuteroaniline**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2. The other ortho position to the bromine, C6, has a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide anion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia serves as the solvent.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Elimination to form benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions: C2 (with a deuterium, D) and C6 (with a hydrogen, H).\n    *   This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, breaking a C-H bond is significantly faster than breaking an equivalent C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n        *   This is the **minor** pathway due to the slower rate of C-D bond cleavage.\n\n*   **Stage 2: Addition of the nucleophile to the benzyne intermediates.**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. A negative charge develops on C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6. A negative charge develops on C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different deuterated anilines.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is standard benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to either C1 or C2. The adjacent carbon becomes negatively charged and is protonated by NH3. In both cases, the final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, the minor pathway produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n**3. Summary of Possible Products:**\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we get three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of *possible* organic products, we must consider the products from both the major and minor pathways. Therefore, there are 3 possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction type.**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine (Br) atom, and the adjacent carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium (D) atom. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Elimination-Addition (Benzyne mechanism). The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the strong base to initiate the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe benzyne intermediate is formed by the elimination of HBr (or in this case, HBr or DBr). The amide ion abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n1.  **Position C-2:** This carbon has a deuterium (D) atom.\n2.  **Position C-6:** This carbon has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C-6 or the deuteron from C-2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The resulting intermediate is a benzyne molecule where the deuterium atom is still at position C-2. This is called **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-H bond, which is generally faster than breaking a C-D bond (due to the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this is the **major** pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, creating a carbanion at this position.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   This pathway involves breaking a C-D bond, which is slower than breaking a C-H bond. This is the **minor** pathway, but it is still possible and will lead to a product.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic addition to the benzyne intermediate(s).**\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (2-deuterobenzyne, from Pathway A):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium is at C-2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2 group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2 group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C-1', so the original C-2 (with D) is now C-3'. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne, from Pathway B):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack by NH2⁻ can occur at either C-1 or C-2 of the triple bond, but since the molecule is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by NH3.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 (or C-2):** The NH2 group attaches, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbanion, which is then protonated. The final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of possible organic products.**\nBy considering both the major and minor pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (C6H5NH2)\n2.  2-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D ortho to NH2)\n3.  3-Deuterioaniline (C6H4DNH2, with D meta to NH2)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must count all chemically distinct molecules that can be formed, even those from minor pathways. Therefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂), a very strong base, in liquid ammonia (NH₃). The amide ion (⁻NH₂) will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from one of the positions ortho to the bromine atom.\n\nThe structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is:\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H)\n   ||  ||\n  (H)C--C(H)\n     \\ /\n      C\n     (H)\n```\nThe positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n*   C2 is substituted with deuterium (D).\n*   C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion (⁻NH₂) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction is still possible. The question asks for all *possible* products.\n2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a normal, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, we have two different benzyne intermediates formed in the first step.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (⁻NH₂). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n**Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The two carbons of the triple bond, C1 and C6, are not equivalent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6:** The ⁻NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nThus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n**Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of ⁻NH₂ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbon, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify all the unique organic products that can be formed.\n\n1.  From Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):\n    *   2-deuterioaniline\n    *   3-deuterioaniline\n2.  From Pathway B (via benzyne):\n    *   Aniline\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we find there are three distinct possible organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n    *   This reaction condition (an aryl halide with a very strong base) is characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The base can abstract a proton from either position, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing H due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed, so the resulting benzyne is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C6. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C1. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway A yields **two** distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via standard benzyne):**\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne at C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C2. The product is **aniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C1. The product is also **aniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway B yields only **one** non-deuterated product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three unique organic products:\n        1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH₂ is a classic benzyne reaction. It occurs in two main steps:\n    *   **Elimination:** The strong base abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the halide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n    *   **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, the amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Elimination Step for 1-bromobenzene-2-d:**\n    The bromine atom is at C1. The *ortho* positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these *ortho* positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, so this pathway is kinetically less favorable due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible reaction).\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, unlabeled **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Analyze the Addition Step for each Benzyne Intermediate:**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ will now attack the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a negative charge develops at C6. Protonation of C6 by the solvent (NH₃) yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a negative charge develops at C1. Protonation of C1 by the solvent yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A leads to two distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Addition to unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C2. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B leads to one organic product.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    Combining the products from both possible pathways, we have:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.

Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an isotopically labeled aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents is a classic condition for the reaction to proceed via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d), an isotope of hydrogen, is at position 2. A normal hydrogen atom (H) is at position 6.\n    *   Reagents: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH2-) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds via a two-step elimination-addition mechanism.\n    *   **Step 1 (Elimination):** The strong base, NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The amide base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is retained in this intermediate.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-HBr)--> 3-d-benzyne` (The deuterium is at position 3 relative to the new triple bond).\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br- from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium.\n        `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(-DBr)--> benzyne` (non-deuterated).\n    *   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and will be the major pathway. However, Pathway B (abstraction of D) is still possible and will occur to a lesser extent. Consequently, **two different benzyne intermediates** will be formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Addition Step for Each Intermediate:**\n    *   **Step 2 (Addition):** The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-d-benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2- attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2, which are ortho to each other).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2- attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2; relative to the NH2 group, the D is in the meta position).\n        *   So, Pathway A produces two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2- at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B produces one non-deuterated product.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we get a mixture of three different organic molecules:\n        1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n        2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a substituted halobenzene with sodium amide in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH₂⁻).\n\n**2. The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates):**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base and abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6:**\n    The C6 position has a hydrogen atom. The amide ion can abstract this proton (H⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] + NH₃`\n    This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a benzyne intermediate. The new triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, D at C2, - at C6)] → 3-deuterobenzyne + Br⁻`\n    The intermediate is named 3-deuterobenzyne because the deuterium is at position 3 relative to the benzyne triple bond (C1-C6).\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2:**\n    The C2 position has a deuterium atom. The amide ion can also abstract this deuteron (D⁺).\n    `C₆H₅(Br at C1, D at C2) + NH₂⁻ → [C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] + NH₂D`\n    This is kinetically slower than abstracting a proton due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond). However, it is still a possible pathway.\n    Following the abstraction, the bromide ion is eliminated, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n    `[C₆H₄(Br at C1, - at C2)] → benzyne + Br⁻`\n    In this case, the deuterium atom has been removed from the ring, so the intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Path A) and **benzyne** (from Path B).\n\n**3. The Addition Step (Formation of Products):**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has -NH₂ at C1 and D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has -NH₂ at C6 and D at C2. This molecule is **3-deuteroaniline** (the -NH₂ and D are in a 1,3 relationship).\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by NH₃, the resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4.

This set of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine all possible products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), a powerful base, abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. This leads to two distinct pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of the proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n    2.  This carbanion then triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(H+ removal from C6)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> 3-deuterobenzyne\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible reaction).\n    2.  This carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(D+ removal from C2)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n    ```\n\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium atom at C2. Therefore, the attack of NH2⁻ can occur at two different sites, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C6 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the -D group at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the -D group at C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature (where the -NH2 group defines C1), this is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2 of a symmetrical C6H4 ring. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbanion, leads to the same single product. Since the deuterium was lost in the formation of this intermediate, the product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from the benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species). Liquid ammonia acts as the solvent and also as a proton source in the final step of the reaction.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, the abstraction of the proton from C6 will be faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is kinetically favored.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C6 (Major Pathway)**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the adjacent C1 position.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where a triple bond exists between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C2 (Minor Pathway)**\n        1.

The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, another amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This creates a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 2-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline**.

Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by its isotope, deuterium (D). Bromine (Br) is at position 1.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH2⁻). Liquid ammonia acts as the solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step elimination-addition mechanism involving a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe base can abstract a particle from either position, leading to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Abstraction of H from C6):**\n    *   The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Abstraction of D from C2):**\n    *   Although less likely, it is still possible for the NH2⁻ base to abstract the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (NH2⁻). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to give the final product.\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne:**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The D is at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2. Protonation of the C6 carbanion gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. Protonation of the C1 carbanion gives a product which, when numbered systematically (with the -NH2 group at position 1), is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne:**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the minor benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from the major 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from the major 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, regardless of their yield. Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which is a classic example of a reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate. This is an elimination-addition reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine atom is the leaving group. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n\n    ```\n        Br\n       / \\\n    (D)C--C(H)\n     //  \\\\\n   (H)C--C(H)\n       \\ /\n        C\n       (H)\n    ```\n    The positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n2.  **Two Possible Elimination Pathways:** The amide ion can abstract either the hydrogen from C6 or the deuterium from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than abstracting a deuteron (D⁺) due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This abstraction is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), will now attack the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n1.  **Products from Intermediate 1 (2-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical because of the deuterium at C2. The triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the amino group attaches to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by ammonia. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group as C1, the deuterium is at the C3 position. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n2.  **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is the standard, symmetrical benzyne with no deuterium. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to symmetry, the attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same product. After protonation, the product is simply **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction produces three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2), which proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

The intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n        *   (Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the lighter isotope (H) is faster than the heavier one (D). So, this pathway is expected to be the major one, but the other pathway is still possible).\n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2.**\n        *   The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.

This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a negative charge forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at the original C6 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position. When naming this as a substituted aniline, the carbon bearing the -NH2 group is C1. The original C2 is now three carbons away, at position C3.

Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (Br), and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism has two main steps:\n    1.  **Elimination:** The strong base (amide ion, NH2-) abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n    2.  **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, another amide ion, NH2-) attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia) to give the final product.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-) can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of the two positions ortho to the bromine atom at C1: C2 (which has a deuterium) or C6 (which has a hydrogen). This leads to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the deuteron (D+) from the C2 position.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    5.  Crucially, since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting benzyne intermediate contains only hydrogen atoms (C6H4). Let's call this **Benzyne-H**.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes D+ at C2)--> Benzyne-H (C6H4)`\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2- base removes the proton (H+) from the C6 position. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    5.  In this pathway, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. The resulting benzyne intermediate is therefore deuterated. Let's call this **Benzyne-D**. Relative to the triple bond (C1-C6), the deuterium is at the C2 position.\n\n    `1-bromo-2-d-benzene --(NH2- removes H+ at C6)--> Benzyne-D (C6H3D)`\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, the nucleophile (NH2-) attacks each of these benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-H (from Pathway A):**\n    1.  Benzyne-H (C6H4) is symmetrical. The NH2- can attack either C1 or C2 of the benzyne triple bond. Both attacks lead to the same carbanion.\n    2.  The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent (NH3), which donates a proton (H+).\n    3.  The final product is **aniline (C6H5NH2)**. Since the starting benzyne had no deuterium, the final product has no deuterium.\n\n    `Benzyne-H + NH2- --> Aryl anion --> +NH3 --> Aniline`\n    This gives **Product 1: Aniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne-D (from Pathway B):**\n    1.  Benzyne-D is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    2.  **Attack at C1:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C6.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium (D) at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    3.  **Attack at C6:**\n        *   The NH2- group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1.\n        *   This carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3). An H atom adds to C1.\n        *   The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium (D) at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium is at the #3 position. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    `Benzyne-D + NH2- --> two possible aryl anions --> +NH3 --> 2-deuteroaniline + 3-deuteroaniline`\n    This gives **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline** and **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   C-2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C-6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C-1 position.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C-2.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-2.\n    3.  This intermediate eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C-1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Importantly, since the deuterium atom was abstracted, this benzyne intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne** (it contains no deuterium).\n\nSo, we have two distinct benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deuteriobenzyne and unlabeled benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.

Protonation of C-6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6, creating a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2, which are meta to each other).\n\n*   **Products from unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetric benzyne. Attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 then loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2-), which is also a good nucleophile, attacks one of the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond.

The NH2- nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. A negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by ammonia (NH3) yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. A negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by ammonia yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium atom is at position 3.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This forms a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This forms a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate** (regular benzyne).\n\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and occurs faster than Pathway B (abstraction of D). However, both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n**4. Step 2: Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon atom of the benzyne \"triple bond\".\n\n*   **Addition to the Deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A negative charge forms on C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A negative charge forms on C1, which is protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces **two different deuterated products**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    *   This intermediate is simply benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. Regardless of where it attacks, the subsequent protonation results in the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B produces **one non-deuterated product**.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial elimination pathways, we identify three unique organic products that can be formed:\n\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n        *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the proton from C-6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  The carbanion intermediate quickly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you renumber the benzyne so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, the deuterium is on C3).\n\n        *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2.** Although slower than H-abstraction, this pathway is still possible.\n            1.  NH2⁻ removes the deuteron from C-2, creating a carbanion at that position.\n            2.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n            3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is simply **benzyne**, with no deuterium atom.\n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are possible: **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Pathway A) and **benzyne** (from Pathway B).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final product.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the products from each intermediate:\n\n        *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Intermediate from Pathway A):**\n            *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6 (original numbering), and the deuterium is at C-2.\n            *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This places a negative charge on C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the -D is at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This places a negative charge on C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the -D is at C-2. Relative to the new -NH2 group, the deuterium is three carbons away. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n            *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two** different organic products.\n\n        *   **Products from benzyne (Intermediate from Pathway B):**\n            *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n            *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n            *   Thus, Pathway B leads to **one** organic product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible, chemically reasonable pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n        1.  Aniline\n        2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n        3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n    The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. Sodium amide is a very strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving a benzyne intermediate. Aromatic halides that lack strong electron-withdrawing groups do not undergo standard nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr). Instead, in the presence of a very strong base like NaNH2, they undergo elimination followed by addition.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the elimination step (formation of benzyne).**\n    The amide ion (:NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    Both D at C2 and H at C6 can be abstracted by the amide ion, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2.**\n        The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard benzyne (C6H4), which has no deuterium.\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -D+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate A) Benzyne\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6.**\n        The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br-) from C1. This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the benzene ring. The resulting intermediate is a deuterated benzyne, specifically 3-deuterobenzyne (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 2 relative to C1, which is position 3 on the new benzyne ring system).\n\n        (Reactant) 1-bromobenzene-2-d --(NaNH2, -H+, -Br-)--> (Intermediate B) 3-Deuterobenzyne\n\n    *Note on Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):* The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so abstraction of the proton from C6 (Pathway B) is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 (Pathway A). However, the question asks for the number of *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is favored.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the addition step for each benzyne intermediate.**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (Benzyne):**\n        Benzyne is symmetrical. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond. Both attacks, after protonation, lead to the same product: aniline.\n\n        Benzyne + NH2- -> Anion -> +NH3 -> **Product 1: Aniline (C6H5NH2)**\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (3-Deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is not symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The amide ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields 2-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are ortho to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C1; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 2: 2-Deuteroaniline**\n\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 at C1 yields 3-deuteroaniline (the NH2 and D groups are meta to each other).\n\n            3-Deuterobenzyne --(1. NH2- attacks C6; 2. Protonation)--> **Product 3: 3-Deuteroaniline**\n\n*   **Step 5: Count the total number of unique organic products.**\n    From the two possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H⁺) from C6 than the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This phenomenon is known as a **primary kinetic isotope effect**.\n    *   However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction from C6):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the H⁺ from C6.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected.\n        5.  This forms **Intermediate I: 3-deuteriobenzyne**. (The benzyne triple bond is between C1-C6, and the D is at C2, which is position 3 relative to the new C1=C6 double bond if we renumber). This is the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction from C2):**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the D⁺ from C2.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule.\n        5.  This forms **Intermediate II: Benzyne** (with no deuterium). This is the minor pathway.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, NH2⁻, now attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate I (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the benzyne triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This places the NH2 group at C1 and creates a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives the final product where NH2 is at C1 and D is at C2. This is **Product 1: 2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This places the NH2 group at C6 and creates a carbanion at C1.

Let's call this **Intermediate A**.\n\n4.  **Pathway B: Removal of Deuteron from C2**\n    *   The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. This is a slower process due to the stronger C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), but it is still a possible pathway.\n    *   A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    *   The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

The most acidic protons are those *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's label the carbons for clarity: Bromine is on C1, and Deuterium (d or D) is on C2.\n        ```\n             Br\n            / \\\n          (C1)-(C2)D\n         //   \\\\\n       H(C6)   (C3)H\n        |     |\n       H(C5)---(C4)H\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        ```\n    *   The positions ortho to the bromine at C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   There are two possible protons (one is actually a deuteron) that can be removed by the base:\n        *   **Path A: Abstraction of the hydrogen (H) at C6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this abstraction is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). The base removes H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6. This anion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Path B: Abstraction of the deuterium (D) at C2.** Although slower than Path A, this pathway is still possible. The base removes D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. This anion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.

This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks the carbon that was originally C6, the new C-N bond forms there. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is now at position 3.

Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide that has a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent (ortho) to the halogen-bearing carbon with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, commonly known as the **benzyne mechanism**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Mechanism**\n\n#### **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from one of the ortho positions (C-2 or C-6) to the bromine atom. This is the elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a proton (H⁺) from the C-6 position.\n    2.  This is generally the faster process due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, as the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-6. This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  The result is the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called a benzyne. In this case, a triple bond forms between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH2⁻) removes a deuteron (D⁺) from the C-2 position.\n    2.  This process is slower than H⁺ abstraction but is still possible.\n    3.  A carbanion is formed at C-2, which then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. Since the deuterium was abstracted from C-2, the resulting benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atom. This is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the solution, the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the electrophilic carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is the addition step. After the attack, the resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. These two positions are not equivalent because of the adjacent deuterium at C-2.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-1. This creates a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH2⁻ group adds to C-6. This creates a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2. By IUPAC nomenclature (numbering from the -NH2 group), this is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n\n     \n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate B (benzyne)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2, and there is no deuterium.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation by NH3, leads to the same single product. This product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n     \n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the two possible initial elimination pathways and the subsequent addition reactions, we find three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nLet's break down the reaction mechanism step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d\nThe structure has a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.\n\n```\n      Br\n     /\n    (1)C--C(2)-D\n   //    \\\\\n(6)C-H    C(3)-H\n  |       |\n(5)C-H--C(4)-H\n```\n\n**Reagent:** NaNH2 in liquid NH3. The active species is the strong base, amide anion (NH2⁻).\n\n**Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this process and remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway A)\n      ...H at C6 abstracted... --> [3-deuteriobenzyne]\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide anion (NH2⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion attacks C1, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n      (Pathway B)\n      ...D at C2 abstracted... --> [benzyne]\n    ```\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The 3-deuteriobenzyne intermediate is asymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. These groups are ortho to each other. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. These groups are meta to each other. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The standard benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same product.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH2 group attaches to one carbon, and a proton from NH3 attaches to the other. Since there is no deuterium on this intermediate, the final product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find that three different organic products can be formed:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, including the effect of isotopic labeling.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3) is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide anion (NH2-) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The positions ortho to the bromine atom at C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base abstracts the proton (H+) from C6. This is kinetically favored over abstracting a deuteron (D+) because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   Abstraction of H+ from C6 creates a carbanion at C6.\n        *   This carbanion then expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base abstracts the deuteron (D+) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n        *   Abstraction of D+ from C2 creates a carbanion at C2.\n        *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br-) from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    *   Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile in the reaction is the amide anion (NH2-). It attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C6, with a D at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2- attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2- attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. Relative to the -NH2 group at C6 (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) leads to two different products.\n\n    *   **Products from benzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated benzyne.\n        *   Attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2 of the benzyne, followed by protonation, leads to the same product: **aniline**.\n        *   So, the minor intermediate (benzyne) leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    The question asks for the number of *possible* organic products. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we have identified three distinct products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nSince all three products are mechanistically possible, even though they will be formed in different amounts, the total number of possible organic products is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium (D).\n    *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    The base can abstract either H or D, leading to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this process is kinetically favored (faster). This is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE).\n        *   Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6 followed by the loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**. This is the **major** intermediate.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. This is slower due to the stronger C-D bond but still possible because NaNH₂ is a very strong base.\n        *   Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2 followed by the loss of Br⁻ from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-2.\n        *   The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. This is the **minor** intermediate.\n        *   A byproduct of this pathway is deuterated ammonia (NH₂D), which will be present in the solvent mixture.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻) or ammonia (NH₃), then attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃) to give the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from major Pathway A):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-1, a carbanion is formed at C-6. This anion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C-6, a carbanion is formed at C-1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. When we renumber the ring to place the -NH₂ group at position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the major pathway produces two different products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n    *   **Addition to non-deuterated benzyne (from minor Pathway B):**\n        This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium on the ring. The NH₂⁻ group attacks the benzyne, and the resulting carbanion is quenched by an acidic species in the solvent. The solvent contains a large amount of NH₃ and a small amount of NH₂D (formed during Pathway B).\n        *   **Protonation by NH₃:** The carbanion abstracts a proton from the abundant NH₃ solvent. The final product has no deuterium. This product is **aniline**.\n        *   **Deuteronation by NH₂D:** The carbanion could abstract a deuteron from the NH₂D present. This would place a deuterium atom on the ring ortho to the -NH₂ group. This product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Tally of Unique Products:**\n    Let's list all the distinct organic molecules produced from all possible pathways:\n    1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A and Pathway B)\n    2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\n    Combining the products from both the major and minor pathways, we find a total of three unique organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine atom is at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2⁻).\n    *   This combination of a substituted benzene with a leaving group (Br) and a very strong base points to an **elimination-addition reaction mechanism**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The strong base, :NH2⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H).\n\n    *   This leads to two possible, parallel elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Removal of H⁺ from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored (faster).\n        *   The electron pair from the C-H bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Removal of D⁺ from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond. However, it is still a possible reaction.\n        *   The electron pair from the C-D bond shifts to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) is expelled from C1.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate has no deuterium atoms. It is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n         \n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Amide to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2⁻) now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

The unique organic products formed are:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nThese three are distinct chemical compounds (isomers or different molecular formulas). Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThis question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This means we have a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. There is also a hydrogen atom (H) at position 6. Both positions 2 and 6 are *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n```\n      Br (at C1)\n     / \\\n  (D)C--C(H) (at C6)\n   ||  ||\n   ...\n```\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (Br⁻). There are two possibilities:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C-6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 to form a benzyne intermediate. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is favored and will be the major pathway.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. Let's call this **Benzyne A**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C-2 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C-1. This pathway is disfavored due to the stronger C-D bond but is still possible.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This benzyne does not contain a deuterium atom, as it was removed in this step. Let's call this **Benzyne B**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH₂⁻), will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product(s).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne A (triple bond C1-C6, D at C2):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-1. A negative charge develops on C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product has the NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks C-6. A negative charge develops on C-1, which is protonated. If we number the final product with the NH₂ group at the #1 position, the original C-6 is now C-1, and the original C-2 (where the deuterium is) is now C-3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne B (triple bond C1-C2, no D):**\n    1.  **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The NH₂⁻ group can attack either C-1 or C-2 of the benzyne triple bond. Since this benzyne is symmetrical (ignoring the other ring protons) and contains no deuterium, attack at either position, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Organic Products**\nBased on the two possible benzyne intermediates, we have identified three different possible organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nThese three molecules are distinct chemical compounds (isotopomers/regioisomers).

The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, :NH2-), and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide (like bromobenzene) with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr in this case). The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton (H+) from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron (D+) from C2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the H from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains untouched at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne-1**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the D from C2 (this is slower but still occurs).\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C2, which expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. Let's call this **Benzyne-2**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\n    The second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The nucleophile is the amide ion (:NH2-). After the addition, the resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne-1 (asymmetric):**\n        Benzyne-1 is asymmetric because of the deuterium at C2. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 (by NH3) adds an H atom. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**. (**Product 1**)\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 adds an H atom. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C6 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position. For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -NH2 group is numbered C1. The deuterium is then at C3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**. (**Product 2**)\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne-2 (symmetric):**\n        Benzyne-2 is the standard, non-substituted benzyne. It is symmetric. Attack of the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 will lead to the same final product after protonation.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The -NH2 group adds to the benzene ring, and an H atom is added to the adjacent carbon. The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**. (**Product 3**)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2-), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two atoms at the ortho positions (C2 and C6): a deuterium (D) at C2 and a hydrogen (H) at C6.\n    *   The amide base can abstract either the proton (H) from C6 or the deuteron (D) from C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH2- removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   (This pathway is kinetically favored due to the **kinetic isotope effect**, as the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH2- removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting benzyne molecule has no deuterium atoms. This is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n        *   (This pathway is possible, although slower than Pathway A).\n\n         \n\n    *   Since both pathways are possible, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2-), then attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is subsequently protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The NH2- can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** Forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (also called ortho-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** Forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (also called meta-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2 (a meta relationship).\n        *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two distinct products**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical.

This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent and Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** Aryl halides treated with a very strong base like NaNH2 undergo an elimination-addition reaction via a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The strong base, amide ion (:NH2-), can abstract a proton from either of these positions. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        3.  This carbanion rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this pathway. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If we number the triple bond carbons as 1 and 2, the deuterium is on the 3rd carbon).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  Although slower, the amide ion can also remove the deuteron (D+) from C2.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n    In the second step, the nucleophile (:NH2-) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to give the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If the :NH2- group adds to C1, a carbanion forms at C6. After protonation (with H from NH3), the final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If the :NH2- group adds to C6, a carbanion forms at C1. After protonation, the final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the D atom at C2. The relative positions are meta (1,3).

The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, this is the major pathway.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C2**\n        *   The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2, which then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, this intermediate is the normal, **undeuterated benzyne**.\n        *   This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the KIE, so it's the minor pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider it.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (⁻NH₂), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent to yield the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate I (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2. The two ends of the triple bond (C1 and C6) are not equivalent.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃.

The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 2-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH₃.

A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3.

This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is bonded to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are bonded to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3).

Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, it is easier and faster to break the C-H bond. However, breaking the C-D bond is also possible. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new strained triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n        4.  **Intermediate I:** 2-deuteriobenzyne (with the triple bond between C1 and C6).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.

Protonation of C1 by ammonia gives the final product. The product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. For naming, if we number the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1', this puts the deuterium on C3'.

Due to the symmetry of the rest of the ring, these attacks lead to the same product.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C2. Protonation of C2 gives **aniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The -NH2 group adds to C2, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 also gives **aniline**.\n        *   Thus, Pathway B leads to only one product: aniline (C6H5NH2).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we get a mixture of three different organic molecules:\n        1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n        2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    *   These three molecules are structurally distinct (aniline has a different molecular formula, and 2- and 3-deuterioaniline are constitutional isomers).\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** An aryl halide reacting with a strong base like sodium amide proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism. The intermediate in this reaction is a highly reactive species called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step):**\n    The amide anion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Since both positions are ortho to the bromine, abstraction from either is possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. This benzyne still contains the deuterium atom at C2. Let's call this **Benzyne I**.\n        *(Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this pathway is kinetically favored and will be the major route, but the question asks for all *possible* products).*\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n        2.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a different benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. Let's call this **Benzyne II**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step):**\n    The benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne I (Deuterated):**\n        This benzyne is unsymmetrical. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When we re-number this molecule according to IUPAC rules (starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        So, Benzyne I leads to two distinct, deuterated products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Attack on Benzyne II (Non-deuterated):**\n        This benzyne also has a triple bond between C1 and C2, but no deuterium. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation of C2 by the solvent NH₃ adds a regular hydrogen atom. The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C2. A carbanion forms at C1, which is protonated by NH₃. The product is also **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        So, Benzyne II leads to only one distinct product.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C1)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A, attack at C6)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (d). The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (like NaNH₂) proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, specifically involving a **benzyne** (or aryne) intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions to C1 (which has Br) are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. These two possibilities lead to two different reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This is a slower process than abstracting H⁺ but is still a possible reaction pathway.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2. This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this benzyne intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), now attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6. The intermediate is unsymmetrical due to the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C1 and the D is at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**. (The NH₂ group is at C6 and the D is at C2, making them *meta* to each other).\n        *   So, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**:\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation gives a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        *   So, Pathway B yields one product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   Combining the products from all possible pathways, we have:\n        1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    *   These are three structurally distinct organic molecules.

This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   The C6 position, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of a proton (H⁺) is significantly faster than the abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺). However, both reactions are possible. This leads to two competing elimination pathways.\n\n3.  **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway)**\n    *   The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   This elimination results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate where a new triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway)**\n    *   Less frequently, the amide ion can remove the deuteron from C2.\n    *   This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    *   This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    *   The resulting benzyne intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium atom was removed in this process, the resulting intermediate is a **non-deuterated benzyne**. The removed deuterium ends up forming deuterated ammonia (NH₂D).\n\n     \n\n5.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n6.  **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH₃ gives a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. Numbering the ring starting from the -NH₂ group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces two distinct isomers: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n     \n\n7.  **Products from Pathway B (from non-deuterated benzyne)**\n    *   The intermediate is a symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2, but since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same initial carbanion (o-aminophenyl anion).\n    *   This carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n    *   The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   (Note: The aminophenyl anion could also be deuterated by the NH₂D formed in this pathway, which would lead to 2-deuterioaniline. However, this is a product already accounted for in Pathway A. The new, unique product from this pathway is aniline.)\n\n     \n\n8.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The reaction produces a mixture of three structurally distinct organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    *   Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* products, which means we must consider all chemically viable pathways, even those that are slower.\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem involves an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at the adjacent position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH3, is ~38).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (aryl halide with no activating groups, very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base, abstracting an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne**.\n\n**Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is weaker and is cleaved more readily than the C-D bond. This phenomenon is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Consequently, Pathway A (H abstraction) will be significantly faster and thus the major pathway, while Pathway B (D abstraction) will be slower and the minor pathway. However, since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider all chemically feasible pathways, even the minor ones.\n\nTherefore, **two different benzyne intermediates** are formed in the reaction: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and unlabeled benzyne (minor).\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the newly formed benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) can also act as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with an -NH2 group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields a product with an -NH2 group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. To name this compound, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, so C6 becomes C1'. In this new numbering, the deuterium is at C3'. The product is **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) gives **two distinct products**.\n\n*   **Attack on unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium label. It is symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same product: **1-aminobenzene** (or aniline).\n    *   Thus, the minor intermediate (benzyne) gives only **one product**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three unique organic molecules:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  1-aminobenzene (aniline)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis is a classic problem involving the benzyne mechanism in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction to determine the number of possible products.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine (Br) at position C1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions: C6 (bearing a hydrogen, H) and C2 (bearing a deuterium, D). This leads to two competing pathways for the initial elimination step.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major Pathway): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a **3-deuteriobenzyne** intermediate. The deuterium atom remains on the ring at position C2.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor Pathway): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. This pathway is slower but still occurs.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **3-deuteriobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** NH2⁻ attacks C1. The resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups are adjacent.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** NH2⁻ attacks C6. The resulting carbanion is at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline), where the -NH2 and -D groups have a meta relationship.\n\n*   **Attack on Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of NH2⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Summary of Products**\nBy considering both pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (*o*-deuterioaniline)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (*m*-deuterioaniline)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br) and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are attached to hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n    *   The reaction is an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. This is a characteristic reaction of aryl halides with strong bases.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s):**\n    The mechanism begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base to abstract a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to C1: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6.**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ base removes the H atom from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n        *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   Let's visualize it: The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2.**\n        *   Although slower, it is still possible for the NH₂⁻ base to remove the deuteron from C2.\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C2.\n        *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this pathway, the deuterium atom has been removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is **undeuterated benzyne** (the standard C₆H₄ benzyne).\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and undeuterated benzyne.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃), to yield the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2.\n        *   Attack at C1: If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, the new NH₂ group is adjacent to the deuterium atom at C2. After protonation, the product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, the new NH₂ group is *meta* to the deuterium atom at C2. After protonation, the product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Therefore, the deuterated benzyne intermediate leads to two different, isomeric products.\n\n    *   **Addition to undeuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond, but because of the symmetry, both attacks lead to the same product after protonation: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n        *   Therefore, the undeuterated benzyne intermediate leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    No other isomers, such as 4-deuteroaniline, can be formed through this mechanism.\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents and reactants points to a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate through an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The two ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n*   Position C2 is substituted with deuterium (d).\n*   Position C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n\nThe C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster and thus the major pathway. However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also possible and represents a minor pathway. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n**Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2.\n2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 leads to the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n**Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by ammonia. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. When numbering the aniline product, the -NH2 group is at position 1, making this **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\nSo, the major pathway (A) leads to two distinct products: 2-deuteroaniline and 3-deuteroaniline.\n\n**Products from Pathway B (via benzyne)**\n\nThe nucleophile NH2⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate at either C1 or C2.\n\n1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1. The carbanion at C2 is protonated. The product is **aniline**.\n2.  **Attack at C2:** The -NH2 group adds to C2. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. The product is also **aniline**.\n\nSo, the minor pathway (B) leads to only one product: aniline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we have three unique organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This specific set of reactants points to an elimination-addition mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and its isotope, deuterium (d), at position 2. The positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine are C2 and C6. C2 has a deuterium atom, and C6 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base, with the amide anion (:NH2-) being the active species. It is strong enough to deprotonate a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne Mechanism)**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-) acts as a base and removes a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In our starting material, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n        *   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n        The C-H bond is weaker and is broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways.\n\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion at C6 then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(H+ removal from C6)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> 3-Deuterobenzyne\n            ```\n\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(D+ removal from C2)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n            ```\n        So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-), which also acts as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n        *   **Reaction of 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n            The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either C1 or C6. These two attacks are not equivalent and lead to different products.\n            1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n            2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n            Thus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate yields two distinct products.\n\n        *   **Reaction of Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n            This is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Attack by NH2- can occur at C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n3.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nThis question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction under conditions that favor a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (via Benzyne)**\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step mechanism: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, followed by the addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium (D).\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen (H).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Crucially, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this pathway. Let's call this **Benzyne-I**. This intermediate has only hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. (Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the lighter proton is faster than the heavier deuteron, so this pathway is favored, but both occur).\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  This intermediate expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. Let's call this **Benzyne-II**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). It will attack the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-I (No Deuterium):**\n    *   Benzyne-I has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The NH₂⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetric (unsubstituted benzyne), attack at either carbon followed by protonation leads to the same product.\n    *   **Product 1:** Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-II (Deuterium at C2):**\n    *   Benzyne-II has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6. These are no longer equivalent positions because of the nearby deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Product 2:** 2-deuteroaniline (or *ortho*-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-NH₂). Thus, C6 becomes the new C1, and the original C2 (with the deuterium) becomes the new C3.\n        *   **Product 3:** 3-deuteroaniline (or *meta*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through two different benzyne intermediates, which in turn lead to three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism (an elimination-addition reaction) and the effect of isotopic labeling.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

The other ortho position, C6, has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The strong base, amide anion (:NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   C2, which is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6, which is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.**\n        *   The base abstracts the proton from C6. This is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   `C6H5(Br at C1, D at C2) + :NH2- → [C6H4(Br at C1, D at C2, anion at C6)]- + NH3`\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C6 then eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   `[C6H4(Br,D,-)]- → Intermediate I + Br-`\n        *   **Intermediate I** is a benzyne molecule where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.**\n        *   The base abstracts the deuteron (D+) from C2. This pathway is slower than Pathway A.\n        *   `C6H5(Br at C1, D at C2) + :NH2- → [C6H4(Br at C1, anion at C2)]- + NH2D`\n        *   The deuterium is removed from the ring and becomes part of an aminodeuterium molecule (NH2D).\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   `[C6H4(Br,-)]- → Intermediate II + Br-`\n        *   **Intermediate II** is a benzyne molecule where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was abstracted in its formation, this is a normal, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then immediately protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate I (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The D is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This forms a carbanion at C6. Protonation by NH3 at C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **aniline-2-d** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This forms a carbanion at C1. Protonation by NH3 at C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2. If we number the final product starting from the -NH2 group as position 1, the D is at position 3. This is **aniline-3-d** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Thus, Intermediate I produces two distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Reaction of Intermediate II (Benzyne):**\n        *   This is a normal benzyne intermediate with no deuterium.

This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the hydrogen atom (H) from C6. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect), so this pathway is faster.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n        3.  The carbanion intermediate is unstable and immediately loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n        1.  Although slower, it is also possible for the amide ion to remove the deuteron (d) from C2.\n        2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion intermediate loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 2-deuteriobenzyne and regular benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Attack by Nucleophile)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Addition to 2-deuteriobenzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate (triple bond between C1-C6, D at C2) is unsymmetrical. The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C6, leading to two different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C1 and the deuterium at the original C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at the original C6 and the deuterium at the original C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the #1 position, the deuterium atom is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Addition to benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   This benzyne intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   The NH2⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n        *   Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by the solvent (NH3), the same single product is formed: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n    1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C1)\n    2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Path A, attack at C6)\n    3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem asks for the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia.\n\n### **1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH2). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n### **2. Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that will abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's draw it and number the carbons:\n\n```\n      D(2)\n     /\nBr(1)-C===C\n    |   |\n  H(6)-C---C-H(3)\n     \\  /\n      C==C\n      |  |\n      H(5) H(4)\n```\n\nThe positions ortho to the bromine at C-1 are C-2 and C-6.\n*   C-2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   C-6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe amide base can abstract a cation from either of these positions, leading to two different elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H⁺ from C-6**\n    The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6, and subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. Therefore, this is the **major pathway**.\n    The elimination of H from C-6 and Br from C-1 results in a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium at C-2 is unaffected. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D⁺ from C-2**\n    The base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C-1. This pathway is slower than Pathway A due to the stronger C-D bond but still occurs. This is the **minor pathway**.\n    When the deuteron is abstracted from C-2, it is removed from the molecule. The resulting triple bond forms between C-1 and C-2. The intermediate is the normal, undeuterated **benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n### **3. Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which will add to the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium is at C-2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1. The resulting carbanion at C-6 is protonated by NH₃. The product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6. The resulting carbanion at C-1 is protonated. This places the -NH₂ group at C-6 relative to the deuterium at C-2. After renumbering to give the substituent the lowest number, this is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    Thus, the major intermediate (3-deuterobenzyne) yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The intermediate is the symmetrical, undeuterated benzyne.\n    1.  **Attack at the triple bond:** The nucleophile NH₂⁻ adds to one of the carbons of the triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. Due to symmetry, the attack at either carbon leads to the same single product: **aniline** (undeuterated).\n\n### **4. Summary of Products**\n\nCombining all the possible products from both pathways:\n1.  **2-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-Deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are three possible, chemically distinct organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted as 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide anion (`NH2-`) abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C2:** This position holds a deuterium atom (d).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position holds a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The `NH2-` base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 attacks the C1-Br bond, causing the bromide ion (Br-) to be eliminated.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected and remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**. This pathway is favored due to the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, as a C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than a C-D bond.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (d+) from C2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 attacks the C1-Br bond, eliminating the bromide ion (Br-).\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**. This pathway is slower than Pathway A but is still possible.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (`NH2-`), which attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3) to yield the final aniline product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The `NH2-` can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The `NH2` group adds to C1. The subsequent protonation occurs at C6. The final product has the `-NH2` group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or *o*-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The `NH2` group adds to C6. The subsequent protonation occurs at C1. The final product has the `-NH2` group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. The relationship between a substituent at C6 and one at C2 is *meta* (1,3 relationship). This product is **3-deuterioaniline** (or *m*-deuterioaniline).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (standard benzyne):**\n        This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium. Due to the symmetry of this benzyne, attack by `NH2-` at C1 or C2 leads to the same product after protonation. The product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2), with no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering both possible reaction pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all structurally distinct molecules that can be formed, even if they are produced in different amounts. Therefore, there are three possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a source of the very strong base, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻).\n    *   The reaction conditions (an aryl halide with a strong base and no strongly electron-withdrawing groups) are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine at C1).\n    *   There are two *ortho* positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the deuteron from C2 or the proton from C6.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. A lone pair is formed on C6. This lone pair then forms a triple bond between C6 and C1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        *   The resulting intermediate is a benzyne where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n        *   This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect, KIE). This will be the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The base can also remove the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. A lone pair forms on C2, which then forms a triple bond between C2 and C1, expelling the bromide ion.\n        *   The resulting intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** (C₆H₄).\n        *   This pathway is slower due to the KIE, but it is still a possible reaction, so it contributes to the pool of possible products.\n\n    *   Conclusion of Step 1: Two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deutero-benzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Reaction of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The highly reactive benzyne intermediates are then attacked by a nucleophile. In this reaction, the amide ion (:NH₂⁻) also acts as the nucleophile. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Reaction of 3-deutero-benzyne:**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2.\n        *   The nucleophile (:NH₂⁻) can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. This carbanion is protonated by an ammonia molecule (NH₃). The product has an -NH₂ group at C1 and a deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. This carbanion is protonated by NH₃. The product has an -NH₂ group at C6 and a deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the #1 position, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Reaction of Benzyne (non-deuterated):**\n        *   This intermediate (C₆H₄) is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack by :NH₂⁻ on either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation by NH₃, leads to the same single product.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), with no deuterium.\n\n4.  **Final Count of Possible Products:**\n    *   Let's list all the unique organic products formed from all possible pathways:\n        1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\n    *   These three molecules are structurally distinct isomers.

NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (:NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    *   The base can abstract either the hydrogen from C6 or the deuterium from C2.\n        *   The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C6 will be the faster, major pathway.\n        *   However, the abstraction of the deuteron from C2 is also a possible, albeit slower, pathway.\n\n    *   This leads to the formation of **two different benzyne intermediates**:\n\n        *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n            1.  The amide ion removes H+ from C6.\n            2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 induces the elimination of the bromide ion from C1.\n            3.

The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack C1 or C2.\n        *   Attack at C1 (followed by protonation at C2) gives aniline.\n        *   Attack at C2 (followed by protonation at C1) also gives aniline.\n        *   Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same single product.\n        *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n         \n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The benzyne triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. This intermediate is not symmetrical. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack C1 or C6, leading to different products.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Product 2: 2-deuterioaniline**\n\n         \n\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. To name this compound systematically, we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group as position 1. In this new numbering, the old C6 is now C1, and the old C2 is now C3. Thus, the product is **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Product 3: 3-deuterioaniline**\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The reaction yields three distinct organic products which are isotopomers (molecules that differ only in their isotopic composition):\n    1.  Aniline (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThis problem describes a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction involving a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with deuterium (d), an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide anion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne Mechanism)**\n\nThis reaction proceeds via a two-step mechanism:\n*   **Step 1: Elimination:** The strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine-bearing carbon. This is an E2-like elimination that forms a highly reactive intermediate called \"benzyne\".\n*   **Step 2: Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, another NH₂⁻ anion or the NH₃ solvent) attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's \"triple bond\". This is followed by protonation to yield the final product.\n\n**3. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nIn our starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two positions *ortho* to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position holds a regular hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  This is generally faster than abstracting a deuteron (D⁺) because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    3.  The resulting carbanion at C6 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  Although slower, it is still possible for the NH₂⁻ base to abstract the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, unsubstituted **benzyne**.\n\n**4. Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, we must consider the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to both of these intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (from 3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    The intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The product has the NH₂ group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is protonated. The product has the NH₂ group at C6 and the D atom at C2. If we renumber the ring so the NH₂ group is at position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *Pathway A yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Products from Pathway B (from unsubstituted benzyne)**\n    The intermediate is symmetrical benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to symmetry, attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated. The resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), with no deuterium.\n    *Pathway B yields one distinct product.*\n\n**5. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both possible pathways, we find three unique organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in total.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThis is a classic problem in organic chemistry involving an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and, ortho to it, a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen). The other ortho position (C-6) has a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is the active species.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction conditions (a substituted halobenzene with a very strong base) are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via an **elimination-addition** mechanism, forming a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which holds a deuterium (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which holds a hydrogen (H).\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect, abstracting the proton (H) from C-6 is faster than abstracting the deuteron (D) from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur. We must consider both pathways since the question asks for all *possible* products.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes H⁺ from C-6, forming a carbanion.\n        2.  The carbanion's lone pair expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you number the benzyne triple bond as C1-C2, the deuterium is at position 3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes D⁺ from C-2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion at C-2 expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  This forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process. This intermediate is the parent, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-1, and a carbanion forms at C-6. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group attaches to C-6, and a carbanion forms at C-1. This anion is protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion.\n        *   Protonation by the solvent (NH₃) gives a product with no deuterium. This product is simply **aniline**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline\n    3.  Aniline (non-deuterated)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
