However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?\n\nA) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\nC) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\nD) λ2 < λ1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The scenario involves two different mean free paths (MFP), λ1 and λ2, within the same TEM sample compartment.\n    *   The physical conditions (pressure, temperature, gas composition, and therefore number density 'n' of gas molecules) are identical for both measurements.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules*. This is the standard definition of MFP in kinetic gas theory.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*. This is the MFP for a beam of particles passing through a target gas.\n    *   The question asks to compare the values of λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** In a gas where all particles are moving randomly, we must account for their relative motion. The standard formula from kinetic theory applies:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` = the collision cross-section for one gas molecule with another. This is related to the physical size of the molecules. In a simple hard-sphere model, σ_gas-gas = πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n        *   The `√2` factor is crucial and arises from averaging over all possible relative velocities of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** In this case, we have a high-energy, directional beam of electrons traveling through a gas of comparatively stationary molecules. (The electron velocity at 1000 keV is a significant fraction of the speed of light, while the gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities). Therefore, we can use the simpler formula for a beam hitting a stationary target:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (same as before).\n        *   `σ_e-gas` = the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gas-gas` represents the effective area for a physical collision between two molecules. It's determined by their size (e.g., van der Waals radius).\n    *   `σ_e-gas` represents the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. An electron is essentially a point particle. The scattering is an electrostatic interaction with the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus.\n    *   Crucially, for a high-energy electron (1000 kV), the probability of interaction is much lower than for two bulky molecules hitting each other. The electron can pass through the atomic structure without interaction much more easily. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules.\n    *   So, we can conclude: **σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas and the Cross-Section Comparison:**\n    *   We have:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Let's look at the denominators:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gas-gas\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_e-gas\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is smaller than σ_gas-gas, and √2 is greater than 1, the entire denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n        (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) > (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator means a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **λ2 > λ1**.\n\n5.  **Perform a Quantitative Estimate:**\n    *   Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n    *   We already established that σ_gas-gas > σ_e-gas, which means the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore: λ2 / λ1 > √2\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414, we have **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  --> This means 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22. This is incorrect because our physics-based derivation shows λ2/λ1 must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1 --> This is incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 --> This means λ2/λ1 >= 1.22. This statement is consistent with our finding that λ2/λ1 > 1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation --> This is incorrect. There is a clear physical reason for the mean free paths to be different.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules among themselves (λ1). This is due to two factors: (1) the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section, and (2) the formula for gas-gas MFP includes a √2 factor in the denominator that is absent in the beam-gas formula. Both effects make λ2 larger than λ1. Our calculation shows λ2 is at least 1.414 times larger than λ1. Option C is the only one that reflects this reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment. It is determined by collisions between the gas molecules themselves. The formula for this MFP is given by kinetic theory:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules, which are all moving at thermal speeds.\n\n    *   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules. The formula for this MFP is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent here because the electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n2.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective cross-sections, σ_gg and σ_eg.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision between two neutral gas molecules. These collisions are governed by short-range intermolecular forces. For a typical small molecule like nitrogen (N2), this cross-section is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulomb force) between the electron and the atom's nucleus and electron cloud. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV is highly relativistic), the interaction time with any single gas molecule is extremely short. The electron zips past so quickly that the probability of it being significantly deflected (scattered) is low unless it passes very close to the nucleus. This results in a very small scattering cross-section. For 1000 keV electrons on a light gas molecule, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻²³ m² or even smaller.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Cross-Sections:**\n    Comparing the typical values:\n    *   σ_gg ≈ 10⁻¹⁹ m²\n    *   σ_eg ≈ 10⁻²³ m²\n\n    It is clear that the gas-gas kinetic cross-section is much larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n    **σ_gg >> σ_eg**\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now we can compare λ1 and λ2.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n    Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, and σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, it follows that λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n\n    **λ2 >> λ1**\n\n    This conclusion makes physical sense. For a Transmission Electron Microscope to function, the electrons must be able to travel through the column with a very low probability of being scattered by residual gas. This requires the electron's mean free path (λ2) to be very long, much longer than the dimensions of the microscope column. The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1) is a different quantity and is expected to be much shorter under the same vacuum conditions.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1\n\n    Our derived relationship is λ2 >> λ1.\n    *   Option D is incorrect.\n    *   Option C is incorrect.\n    *   Option B states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). Our analysis shows the difference is many orders of magnitude, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   Option A states that λ2 is at least 1.22 times larger than λ1. Since our analysis shows λ2 is vastly larger than λ1 (e.g., thousands of times larger), this condition is comfortably met. The number 1.22 simply serves as a threshold greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion consistent with the physics of the scenario is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   **n:** The number of target particles per unit volume. In this scenario, the gas pressure and temperature are constant, so the number density 'n' of residual gas molecules is the same for both cases.\n*   **σ:** The collision cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of the target for a collision to occur. This is the key parameter that differs between the two situations.\n\n**2. Analyze λ1: Gas Molecule MFP**\n\n*   λ1 is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this case, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are moving with thermal velocities. This movement of the targets increases the probability of collision compared to a situation with stationary targets.\n*   Kinetic theory accounts for this with a factor of √2 (approximately 1.414).\n*   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   where σ_gg is the gas-kinetic cross-section (i.e., the effective area of one gas molecule for collision with another).\n\n**3. Analyze λ2: Electron MFP**\n\n*   λ2 is the mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the 1000 kV beam) colliding with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the projectile is a very fast electron (moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light), and the targets are the relatively slow-moving (quasi-stationary) gas molecules.\n*   Because the targets are effectively stationary compared to the electron's high speed, the √2 factor is not present in the formula.\n*   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   where σ_eg is the scattering cross-section of a gas molecule for a high-energy electron.\n\n**4. Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the reasoning.\n*   **σ_gg:** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the electron shells of the gas molecule. It's the cross-section for a \"hard-sphere\" like collision between two molecules.\n*   **σ_eg:** This is the scattering cross-section for a 1000 keV (1 MeV) electron. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that is highly penetrating. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. For such a high energy, the electron can often pass straight through the diffuse electron cloud of a light gas molecule (like N₂, O₂, H₂O) without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered out of the beam). The probability of a collision is much lower.\n*   Therefore, the effective area for collision as seen by the high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section between two gas molecules.\n*   Conclusion: **σ_eg < σ_gg**\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n\nNow we can find the relationship between λ2 and λ1 by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**6. Draw the Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   Since we established that σ_eg < σ_gg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than √2.\n*   **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n**7. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This contradicts λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The physics of the two collision types are different.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the electron has a larger collision cross-section, which is physically wrong for a high-energy electron.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1. This is the only option consistent with the physical reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n### **1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\n`λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction between two electrically neutral gas molecules is governed by short-range forces (like van der Waals forces). For a \"collision\" to happen, the molecules must get very close to each other.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ1):** The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gg` (gas-gas), is related to the physical, kinetic size of the molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** An electron from the beam.\n*   **Target Particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction is between a charged particle (the electron) and a gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons). This is a long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) interaction. The incoming electron can be deflected (scattered) by the atom's electric field even from a considerable distance, without needing to physically \"hit\" it.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ2):** The collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule, let's call it `σ_eg` (electron-gas), is determined by this long-range Coulomb interaction.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n### **4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The number density `n` of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios because the pressure and temperature inside the chamber have not changed.\n*   The crucial difference lies in the cross-sections. The effective area for a long-range Coulomb interaction (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the effective area for a short-range, kinetic-theory-based collision (`σ_gg`). An electron is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule's electric field than two gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n*   Therefore, we can conclude: `σ_eg > σ_gg`\n\n### **5. Concluding the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\nSince the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, and we have established that `σ_eg > σ_gg`:\n\n*   A larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n*   Because `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the corresponding mean free path `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n\n`λ2 < λ1`\n\nThis means an electron traveling through the residual gas in the vacuum chamber will, on average, travel a shorter distance before being scattered than a gas molecule will travel before colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Expression for λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor a gas molecule moving through other identical, moving gas molecules, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the particles.\nThe formula for λ1 is:\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Expression for λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor an electron moving through the gas, the situation is different. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them relativistic and extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Velocity of a 1000 keV electron is ~0.94c (where c is the speed of light).\n*   Thermal velocity of a gas molecule (e.g., N₂) at room temperature is ~500 m/s.\n\nSince the electrons are vastly faster, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not needed.\nThe formula for λ2 is:\nλ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### **5. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nNow, we need to compare the two cross-sections. We can use a simple hard-sphere model for a first-order approximation.\n*   Let the diameter of a gas molecule be `d_gas` and its radius be `r_gas = d_gas / 2`.\n*   An electron can be considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible in this context).\n\n*   **σ_gg (Molecule-Molecule):** When two identical spheres of radius `r_gas` collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2 * r_gas = d_gas`. The effective target area is a circle of radius `d_gas`.\n    σ_gg = π * (d_gas)² = π * (2 * r_gas)² = 4π(r_gas)²\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Molecule):** When a point-like electron collides with a spherical molecule of radius `r_gas`, a collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r_gas` of the molecule's center. The effective target area is the geometric cross-section of the molecule.\n    σ_eg = π * (r_gas)²\n\n*   **Ratio of Cross-Sections:**\n    σ_gg / σ_eg = [4π(r_gas)²] / [π(r_gas)²] = 4\n\nThis simple model shows that the collision cross-section for two molecules is about 4 times larger than that for an electron and a molecule.\n\n### **6. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths**\n\nNow substitute the cross-section ratio back into our equation for the MFP ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4 = 4√2\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\nThis indicates that the mean free path for an electron is significantly *longer* than the mean free path for a gas molecule under the same conditions. This is due to two factors:\n1.  The absence of the √2 factor for electron collisions (a factor of ~1.41 increase).\n2.  The smaller collision cross-section for the electron (a factor of 4 increase in the hard-sphere model).\n\n### **7. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have concluded that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1). Let's review the given options:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\nB) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result is much larger)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct)\n\nOur calculated result, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1, satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Even if we only consider the √2 factor and assume the cross-sections are equal (which is physically an underestimate), we would get λ2 ≈ 1.41 * λ1, which also satisfies λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Therefore, option D is the only logical conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons*. It represents the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is determined by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area a target particle presents for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**: The projectile is a gas molecule, and the targets are other gas molecules. The number density of targets is `n`. The collision cross-section is for gas-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_gg`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**: The projectile is an electron, and the targets are the gas molecules. The number density of targets is the same `n`. The collision cross-section is for electron-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_eg`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    To find the relationship between λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg\n\n    This shows that the ratio of the mean free paths is inversely proportional to the ratio of their respective collision cross-sections. To know how λ2 compares to λ1, we must compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. It is also moving at extremely high, relativistic speeds (due to the 1000 kV acceleration). The gas molecules are essentially stationary targets from the electron's perspective. The effective target area (`σ_eg`) is determined by the size of the gas molecule. In a simple model, this cross-section is approximately the physical area of the molecule, σ_eg ≈ π * r², where `r` is the radius of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Here, a gas molecule is colliding with another gas molecule. Both particles have a significant size (`r`), and both are moving. The fact that the target molecules are also moving increases the likelihood of a collision compared to if they were stationary. Standard kinetic theory shows that this effect introduces a factor of √2. The cross-section is larger because it depends on the radii of *both* colliding particles. The collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2r`.\n        Therefore, the cross-section for gas-gas collisions is larger than for electron-gas collisions. A standard result from kinetic theory is:\n        σ_gg ≈ √2 * σ_eg\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now substitute the relationship between the cross-sections back into the ratio for λ:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg ≈ (√2 * σ_eg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n\n    Since √2 is approximately 1.414, we have:\n    λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    Based on our finding that λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, let's check the given choices:\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. (Correct, as 1.414 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1. (Incorrect, λ2 is larger than λ1)\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. (Incorrect, as 1.414 is not less than 1.22)\n\nThe core principle is that an electron, being much smaller and faster, can travel further on average than a gas molecule before hitting another gas molecule. Therefore, the electron's mean free path (λ2) is longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ1). Option B correctly captures this physical reality and provides a reasonable quantitative boundary.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other* before the electron beam is activated.\n*   **Moving Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particle:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** This is the density of the residual gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum. Let's call it `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** This is the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. In the kinetic theory of gases, for identical molecules of diameter `d`, this is often expressed as σ_kinetic = πd². To account for the relative motion of all particles, a factor of √2 is introduced. So, the effective cross-section is σ₁ = √2 * π * d². This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud.\n\nSo, the formula for λ1 is:\n**λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁) = 1 / (n_gas * √2 * π * d²)**\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This is the mean free path of electrons from the beam scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n*   **Moving Particle:** A high-energy electron (accelerated by 1000 kV).\n*   **Target Particle:** The same residual gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The number density of the target gas molecules is unchanged, so it's the same `n_gas` as before.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule. An electron is a fundamental point-like particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the electromagnetic force (Coulomb interaction). The collision is not a \"hard-sphere\" physical contact.\n\nSo, the formula for λ2 is:\n**λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)**\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n\nThe relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relative sizes of σ₁ and σ₂.\n\n*   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. For a small molecule like nitrogen (N₂), the diameter is about 0.37 nm (3.7 Å). The cross-section is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n*   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas):** A 1000 kV electron is highly relativistic and moving at over 94% of the speed of light. At such high energies, the electron interacts very weakly with the atom's electron cloud unless it's a direct hit. The scattering cross-section for high-energy electrons on atoms is known to be **much smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section. The electron essentially \"sees\" the atom as a much smaller target than another atom does. The cross-section for this type of interaction is typically on the order of 10⁻²² m² or even smaller.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state that:\n**σ₁ >> σ₂**\n\n### **5. Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\nSince the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ` (i.e., λ = 1 / (nσ)), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path.\n\nBecause **σ₁ > σ₂**, it must be that:\n**λ1 < λ2**\n\nFurthermore, since σ₁ is several orders of magnitude larger than σ₂, λ2 will be several orders of magnitude larger than λ1.\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. It suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1, but our analysis shows it should be much larger.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as it implies the cross-sections are equal, which they are not.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states that λ2 is larger than λ1. The factor 1.22 is a very conservative lower bound; given that λ2 is likely thousands of times larger than λ1, this inequality is certainly true. It is the only option that reflects the correct physical relationship.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: This is the opposite of our conclusion.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the high-energy electron (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) represents the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision. A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In this problem, the environment (pressure, temperature, volume, and thus the number density `n` of gas molecules) is the same for both λ1 and λ2. The only difference is the nature of the colliding particles, which directly affects the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n        *   This describes a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n        *   The collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) and is often modeled as a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n        *   The collision cross-section, let's call it **σ1**, is related to the physical size (the kinetic diameter) of the gas molecules.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n        *   This describes a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   This collision is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons) via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n        *   An electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule to be scattered or deflected. It can be influenced by the molecule's electric field from a significant distance.\n        *   This long-range interaction means the effective target area the gas molecule presents to the electron is much larger than its physical size.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron-gas interaction, let's call it **σ2**, is significantly larger than the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas interaction (σ1).\n\n3.  **Comparing the Mean Free Paths**\n    *   We have established that the collision cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger than for gas-gas scattering: **σ2 > σ1**.\n    *   The formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ). This shows an inverse relationship between λ and σ.\n    *   Since `n` is constant and σ2 > σ1, it must be true that the corresponding mean free path for the electron (λ2) is smaller than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ1).\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    An electron traveling through the residual gas is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule than a gas molecule is to be scattered by another gas molecule. This means the average distance an electron travels between collisions (λ2) will be shorter than the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** This is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n*   **λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Since the target molecules are also moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the denominator.\n    *   Formula: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of gas molecules, and σ_gg is the gas-gas collision cross-section (the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them extremely fast (relativistic speeds, close to the speed of light). Compared to this, the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   Formula: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the same number density of gas molecules, and σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section (the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event).\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ1 and λ2, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThis equation reveals two key differences that determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1:\n1.  **The √2 Factor:** This factor is present simply because λ1 describes collisions between moving particles of similar mass, while λ2 describes a very fast particle hitting stationary targets. This factor alone means that if the cross-sections were identical (σ_gg = σ_eg), then λ2 would be √2 times λ1 (λ2 = 1.414 * λ1).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg** is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules. It's the area presented by one molecule to another in a \"billiard ball\" type collision.\n    *   **σ_eg** is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. An electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field. Because an atom is mostly empty space, a high-energy electron can often pass through without a significant interaction (scattering). Therefore, the effective target area for an electron (σ_eg) is generally considered to be *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (σ_gg).\n    *   If σ_eg < σ_gg, then the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n\n### **3. Synthesize the Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two points above:\n\n*   The ratio λ2 / λ1 has a baseline factor of √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   This factor is multiplied by (σ_gg / σ_eg), which is also expected to be greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be significantly greater than √2. A common approximation in vacuum technology textbooks suggests this ratio can be as high as 4√2 ≈ 5.66.\n\nIn any physically realistic scenario for this problem, **λ2 > √2 * λ1**, which means **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's look at the given choices:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer, not shorter.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1. The upper bound of 1.22*λ1 is too low.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. This ignores both the relative motion factor (√2) and the difference in collision cross-sections.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly also greater than 1.22 * λ1. This statement is a robustly true conclusion based on the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths measured under the same conditions of temperature, pressure, and volume, which means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ1):** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. The moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for a molecule-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ1`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam. The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for an electron-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ2`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\n3.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths:**\n    To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (n * σ1)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    This equation shows that the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections, `σ1` and `σ2`.\n    *   If `σ2 > σ1`, then `λ2 < λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 < σ1`, then `λ2 > λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 = σ1`, then `λ2 = λ1`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the difference between `σ1` and `σ2`.\n\n    *   **σ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This is the \"gas-kinetic\" cross-section. It describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is governed by very short-range forces (like van der Waals forces) and is closely related to the physical size of the molecules. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" collision.\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be scattered by the electric field of the nucleus or the molecule's electron cloud. It can also lose energy and ionize or excite the molecule. Because the electromagnetic force is long-range, the electron can be significantly deflected (a \"collision\" event) even when passing the molecule at a distance much larger than its physical radius.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    The long-range electromagnetic interaction between an electron and a molecule results in a much larger effective target area than the short-range interaction between two neutral molecules. Therefore, the electron-molecule collision cross-section is significantly larger than the molecule-molecule collision cross-section.\n    σ2 > σ1\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 < 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 < λ1\n\n    The mean free path of the electrons with respect to the gas molecules is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules with respect to each other. Mike's observation of a different mean free path is physically correct, and the new mean free path `λ2` is smaller than `λ1`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect. The cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This also implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 - Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n\n(Note: The factor of 1.22 in options B and C is likely a distractor, possibly borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for resolution in optics and microscopy, and is not relevant to the comparison of these two types of mean free paths.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same gaseous environment within a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) sample chamber.\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical gas molecules. This is the standard definition of MFP in a gas.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the TEM beam) colliding with one of the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the gas molecules in this case).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n    *   The targets are other gas molecules, which are also in motion.\n    *   Because the target molecules are moving, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section (σ_gg) is related to the physical size of the molecules. If 'd' is the diameter of a gas molecule, the cross-section is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV = 1 MeV).\n    *   The targets are gas molecules.\n    *   The electron's speed is relativistic, extremely close to the speed of light (v ≈ 0.94c for a 1 MeV electron). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   The formula for λ2 does not have the √2 factor: λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 now hinges on the comparison between their respective effective cross-sections: (√2 * π * d²) for λ1 and (σ_eg) for λ2.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (for λ1):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. It's a relatively large value. For a typical gas like N₂, it's on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (for λ2):** This is determined by the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the molecule. For a very high-energy (1 MeV) electron, the interaction is very different from a simple \"physical collision\". The electron travels so fast that the time it spends near any given gas molecule is incredibly short. This leads to a very low probability of significant interaction (scattering). In high-energy physics, it's a well-established principle that scattering cross-sections decrease significantly as the energy of the incident particle increases.\n    *   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron on a gas molecule (σ_eg) is *much smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of that molecule (πd²).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   We have established that σ_eg is much smaller than πd².\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the MFP formulas:\n        *   Denominator for λ1: (√2 * n * π * d²)\n        *   Denominator for λ2: (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Since σ_eg << πd², it is certain that (n * σ_eg) << (√2 * n * π * d²).\n    *   The denominator for λ2 is much smaller than the denominator for λ1.\n    *   Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the denominator (λ = 1 / denominator), a much smaller denominator results in a much larger mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can strongly conclude that **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so it will not be bounded by a small factor like 1.22.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option that reflects the fact that λ2 is larger than λ1. The value 1.22 is a lower bound which is easily satisfied, as our physical reasoning indicates the ratio λ2/λ1 is very large. (Even a highly simplified and incorrect model assuming σ_eg = πd² would give λ2/λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies this inequality).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths (MFPs):\n\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam. This is the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\nThe general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles**: Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume. This value is constant for both scenarios since the vacuum state and temperature are fixed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd'. When two such molecules collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance 'd' of each other. The effective target area is therefore σ_gg = πd².\n*   **Formula**: For a gas of identical particles in thermal motion, the relative velocity is higher than the average velocity. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: An electron from the beam. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at near the speed of light.\n*   **Target Particles**: The stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The same 'n' as before.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule. An electron is, for scattering purposes, essentially a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). It collides with a gas molecule of diameter 'd' (and radius r = d/2). The effective target area is determined by the size of the molecule alone: σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd².\n*   **Formula**: Because the electrons are moving so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary. The √2 factor, which accounts for the relative motion of targets, is not needed.\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (1/4)πd²) = 4 / (nπd²)\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1 using the formulas derived above.\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (nπd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * πd²) ]\n\nThe terms 'n', 'π', and 'd²' cancel out:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\nThe result of our analysis is that the mean free path of an electron (λ2) is approximately 5.66 times larger than the mean free path of a gas molecule (λ1). Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result 5.66 is not in this range)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, since 5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical reason for this difference is that the collision cross-section is much smaller for a point-like electron hitting a molecule than for two molecules of significant size hitting each other. A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path. Our calculation, based on a standard hard-sphere model, shows λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. The inequality λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is therefore the correct conclusion. More advanced physics models show that for high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section is even smaller, making the ratio λ2/λ1 even larger, which further strengthens this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ1):** This describes the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   Moving particle: Gas molecule.\n        *   Target particles: Other gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of gas molecules is `n`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is σ1. This is the **gas-kinetic cross-section**. It's determined by the physical size of the molecules. For two identical molecules of diameter `d`, the cross-section is roughly σ1 ≈ πd². This type of collision is like two billiard balls hitting each other.\n        *   Therefore, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1).\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This describes the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   Moving particle: Electron.\n        *   Target particles: Gas molecules.\n        *   The number density `n` of the target gas molecules is the same as in Scenario 1, since the temperature and pressure are constant.\n        *   The collision cross-section is σ2. This is the **electron scattering cross-section**.\n        *   Therefore, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   The crucial difference lies in the nature of the collision.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ1):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is very short-range, essentially a \"hard-sphere\" or physical contact collision. The effective area (σ1) is based on the physical radii of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Collision (σ2):** An electron is a charged particle. A gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the nucleus or an orbital electron to be deflected (scattered). It can be scattered by the atom's electric field from a much larger distance.\n    *   Because of this long-range interaction, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly larger than the physical target area it presents to another neutral gas molecule (σ1).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude: **σ2 > σ1**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and we have established that σ2 > σ1, it must follow that λ2 < λ1.\n    *   A larger collision cross-section (σ2) means a higher probability of collision per unit distance, which results in a shorter average distance traveled between collisions (a smaller mean free path, λ2).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section. Mike's observation is consistent with fundamental physics.\n\nThe options are:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect.\nB) λ2 < λ1 - Correct.\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\n\nThe value `1.22` in options C and D is a distractor, likely borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, and is not relevant to this problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its fundamental formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of target gas molecules is `n`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** When considering collisions between identical molecules moving with thermal velocities, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` to account for the relative motion. The cross-section itself is related to the physical size of the molecules. Let's call the molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section `σ_gg` (often approximated as `πd²`, where `d` is the molecular diameter).\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of the target gas molecules is the same `n`, as the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_eg`). The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (1000 kV is a relativistic energy), while the gas molecules are essentially stationary in comparison. Therefore, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### 4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n\n*   **Molecule-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For a typical gas molecule like N₂, the diameter is a few Angstroms (e.g., ~3.6 x 10⁻¹⁰ m), leading to a cross-section on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n*   **Electron-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This describes the interaction of a tiny, point-like electron with the electromagnetic field of a molecule. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is very brief as it speeds past the molecule. In high-energy physics, it's a general principle that scattering cross-sections decrease as the energy of the projectile particle increases. The gas molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the highly energetic electron. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the molecule to the fast electron is much smaller than its physical size presented to another, slower molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    σ_eg << σ_gg\n\n### 5. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2)\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas. Let's look at their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\nTherefore:\nλ2 / λ1 >> sqrt(2)\nSince `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414, we can definitively conclude that:\nλ2 / λ1 > 1.414\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's check which option matches our conclusion `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2/λ1 is between 1 and 1.22, which contradicts our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option consistent with the conclusion that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (and specifically, greater than 1.414 * λ1).\n\nThe electrons, being very fast and small, are much less likely to collide with the residual gas molecules than the gas molecules are with each other. This results in a much longer mean free path for the electrons.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂**\n\n*   **λ₁ (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The key factors are the number density of gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (σ₁).\n*   **λ₂ (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*. The key factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ₂).\n\n### **2. The Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   For λ₁, which involves collisions between identical, moving gas molecules, a correction factor for relative motion (√2) is typically included:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n\n*   For λ₂, the projectile is a very high-speed electron (1000 kV is relativistic), and the target gas molecules are comparatively stationary. Therefore, the correction factor is not used:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nThe number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same in both scenarios because the vacuum conditions and temperature do not change.\n\n### **3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the two cross-sections:\n\n*   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section):** This is essentially a \"hard-sphere\" collision. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the electron clouds of the gas molecules. Two molecules collide when their electron clouds get close enough to repel each other. This area, σ₁, is relatively large and is related to the kinetic diameter of the molecule (σ₁ ≈ πd²).\n\n*   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is a completely different interaction. An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. A high-energy (1 MeV) electron interacts with the gas molecule via the electrostatic force (Coulomb interaction). Because of its high speed and small size, the electron can easily pass through the \"empty space\" within the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction. A \"collision\" or scattering event only occurs if it passes very close to the nucleus or one of the molecule's own electrons.\n\n**Conclusion:** The effective area that a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron (σ₂) is much, much smaller than the area it presents to another gas molecule (σ₁).\n\nTherefore: **σ₂ << σ₁**\n\n### **4. Determine the Relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths using the formulas and our conclusion about the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nSince σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, the denominator for λ₂ (n * σ₂) is much smaller than the denominator for λ₁ (√2 * n * σ₁). A smaller denominator results in a larger value.\n\nTherefore: **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\nThe electron will travel, on average, a significantly longer distance before scattering than a gas molecule will before colliding with another molecule.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's look at the options in light of our conclusion that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁.\n\n*   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. This is incorrect; the difference should be substantial.\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This states that λ₂ is larger than λ₁ by at least a factor of 1.22. Since we concluded that λ₂ >> λ₁, this statement is consistent with our physical reasoning. Even in a very conservative estimate where σ₂ was equal to σ₁, the ratio λ₂/λ₁ would be √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies the condition. Since σ₂ is actually much smaller than σ₁, the ratio will be much larger, making this statement definitively true.\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the collision physics are fundamentally different.\n*   D) λ₂ < λ₁: This is the opposite of what the physics predicts.\n\nThe only option that correctly reflects the physical reality is B. The factor 1.22 is likely included as a distractor or a very conservative lower bound, but the inequality is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In both scenarios described, the conditions of the residual gas in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same. This means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant. The only difference between the calculation of λ1 and λ2 is the nature of the collision, which affects the collision cross-section `σ`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering a gas molecule moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a radius `r`. A collision occurs when the center of one molecule comes within a distance of `2r` (the sum of the radii of the two identical molecules) of the center of another molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ1, is the area of a circle with radius `2r`.\n        *   σ1 = π * (2r)² = 4πr²\n        *   So, the mean free path for gas-gas collisions is: **λ1 = 1 / (n * 4πr²)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering an electron from the beam moving and colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   The size of an electron is negligible compared to the size of a gas molecule. We can treat the electron as a point particle.\n        *   A collision occurs when the electron comes within a distance of `r` (the radius of the gas molecule) of the center of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ2, is the area of a circle with radius `r`.\n        *   σ2 = π * r²\n        *   So, the mean free path for electron-gas collisions is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * πr²)**\n\n3.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * πr²)] / [1 / (n * 4πr²)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (n * 4πr²) / (n * πr²)\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4\n\n    This means **λ2 = 4 * λ1**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The mean free path for an electron scattering with gas molecules (λ2) is approximately four times longer than the mean free path for gas molecules scattering with each other (λ1). This is because the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is about four times smaller than that for two molecules hitting each other.\n\n    Let's evaluate the given options based on our result λ2 = 4 * λ1:\n    A) λ2 < λ1: False.\n    B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False.\n    C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True, since 4 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False, since 4 is not less than 1.22.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWe have two scenarios to compare:\n*   **λ1**: The MFP of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2**: The MFP of high-energy electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nThe number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases. The temperature is also the same, but this primarily affects the speed of the gas molecules, which we will account for. The key differences lie in the collision dynamics and the cross-sectional area of the interaction.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn a gas, all molecules are in constant, random motion. When calculating the collision frequency for a single molecule, we must consider the relative velocity with respect to other moving molecules. For a gas in thermal equilibrium (with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds), this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the MFP formula.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, the cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d` (the minimum distance between centers for a collision), so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn this case, we have a beam of very high-energy electrons (1000 kV) traveling through the gas.\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (~0.94c for 1000kV electrons). The residual gas molecules, with thermal velocities of a few hundred m/s, are essentially stationary by comparison. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not needed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The electron is considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). A collision occurs if this point particle passes within the radius (`r`) of the target molecule.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of an electron in a gas is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. In the same hard-sphere model, a point-like electron collides with a molecule of radius `r = d/2`. The cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4**.\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, we substitute the cross-sections from our hard-sphere model:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (πd² / (πd²/4))\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4√2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, based on this standard model, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\n### **5. Considering Simpler Models and Conclusion**\n\nEven if we use a highly simplified model where we ignore the difference in geometric cross-section and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, the ratio would still be:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nIn either a standard or a simplified physical model, the mean free path of the electron (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). The ratio is at least √2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as our calculated ratios of ~1.414 and ~5.66 are both greater than 1.22)\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, as our calculated ratio is greater than 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n\nThe physics robustly indicates that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. The value 1.22 in the options is a threshold that is clearly surpassed. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an ultra-high vacuum.\n    *   **Key Players:**\n        *   Residual gas molecules in the vacuum.\n        *   High-energy electrons (from a 1000 kV accelerating voltage) forming a beam.\n    *   **Two Scenarios & Mean Free Paths:**\n        *   **λ1:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   **λ2:** The mean free path of the electrons from the beam. This is determined by electrons scattering off the stationary gas molecules.\n    *   **Goal:** Compare λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` is the scattering cross-section (the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision).\n    *   A crucial detail from the kinetic theory of gases: When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule within its own gas (like for λ1), the target molecules are also moving. This constant motion increases the likelihood of collision compared to if the targets were stationary. To account for this, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n    *   Therefore, the two specific formulas we need are:\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components of the Formulas:**\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The problem states the conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) remain the same. Therefore, the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant for both calculations.\n    *   **Velocity Factor (`√2`):**\n        *   For λ1, the target gas molecules are moving with thermal velocities, similar to the probe molecule. The `√2` factor is necessary.\n        *   For λ2, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV. Their speed is extremely high (relativistic, near the speed of light). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Thus, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The `√2` factor is *not* present for λ2.\n    *   **Cross-Section (`σ`):** This is the most complex part, but we can analyze it using a simplified \"hard-sphere\" model.\n        *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Imagine two spherical gas molecules of diameter `d`. A collision occurs if their centers get closer than the distance `d`. The effective target area, or cross-section, is therefore σ_gg = π * d².\n        *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** Now imagine a point-like electron (its physical size is negligible) approaching a spherical gas molecule of radius `r = d/2`. A collision occurs if the electron passes within the radius of the molecule. The effective target area is σ_eg = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4.\n        *   **Comparing Cross-Sections:** From this model, we see that σ_eg = σ_gg / 4. The target area for an electron is four times smaller than the effective target area for another molecule.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Let's write down the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n    *   The `n` terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    *   Now substitute the relationship we found for the cross-sections (σ_eg = σ_gg / 4):\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / (σ_gg / 4)\n    *   The σ_gg terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    *   Calculate the numerical value: √2 is approximately 1.414.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n5.  **Alternative Simplified Approach:**\n    *   What if the question intends for an even simpler model where we ignore the difference in cross-section size and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg? This isolates the effect of the target motion.\n    *   In this case, the ratio would be:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg ≈ √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   So, under this simplification, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The options are:\n        A) λ2 = λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n        D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   Our first, more detailed calculation gave λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. This satisfies option D, as 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   Our second, simplified calculation gave λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1. This also satisfies option D, as 1.414 is greater than 1.22.\n    *   Both plausible physical models lead to the same conclusion. The mean free path for the electron (λ2) is larger than the mean free path for a gas molecule (λ1). The factor is at least √2, which is greater than 1.22.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The physical reasoning robustly supports the conclusion that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. Therefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.

Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n*   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n*   The collision involves two particles of similar mass and speed (determined by temperature). Kinetic theory for a gas of identical molecules shows that the relative motion introduces a factor of `√2`.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_gg`, is determined by the size of the molecules. If we model a molecule as a hard sphere with diameter `d`, a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules approach within a distance `d`. The effective target area is thus a circle of radius `d`, so `σ_gg = π * d²`.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * π * d²)`.\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are high-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n*   The target particles are the gas molecules, with the same number density `n_gas`.\n*   The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The `√2` factor does not apply in this case.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Let's analyze the factors determining `σ_eg`:\n    *   **Size:** The electron is a point-like particle compared to the gas molecule (diameter `d`). In a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model, a collision occurs if the electron hits the molecule. The target area is a circle of radius `r = d/2`. So, `σ_eg ≈ π * r² = π * (d/2)² = π * d² / 4`.\n    *   **Energy:** The electrons are highly energetic (1 MeV). The scattering cross-section for high-energy charged particles (described by Rutherford or Mott scattering) is inversely related to the energy of the particle. A high-energy electron is very \"penetrating\" and less likely to be scattered than a slow-moving particle. This means the actual `σ_eg` is much smaller than the geometric cross-section.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)`.\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nWe need to compare `λ1` and `λ2`. Let's form the ratio `λ2 / λ1`:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]`\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\nNow, let's compare the cross-sections `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`:\n*   From the hard-sphere size argument alone: `σ_gg = π * d²` and `σ_eg = π * d² / 4`. This gives `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n*   The high energy of the electron further reduces `σ_eg`, making the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` even larger than 4.\n\nSo, `σ_gg` is significantly larger than `σ_eg`. Let's denote this as `σ_gg >> σ_eg`.\n\nPlugging this into our ratio for λ:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n\nSince `√2 ≈ 1.414` and `σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1`, it is clear that the ratio `λ2 / λ1` will be significantly greater than 1.\n\nUsing the simple hard-sphere model as a conservative estimate:\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4 = 4√2 ≈ 5.66`\n\nThis means `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. More realistic physics (considering the high energy) would yield an even larger ratio.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** Our calculation shows `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. Since 5.66 is greater than 1.22, this option is consistent with our physical analysis.\n*   **B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This option implies that `λ2` is only slightly larger than `λ1` (less than 22% larger). This contradicts our finding that `λ2` is several times larger than `λ1`.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is incorrect, as the projectile and its energy are different, leading to different cross-sections.\n*   **D) λ2 < λ1:** This would imply `σ_eg > σ_gg`, which is physically incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical principles governing particle collisions dictate that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (`λ2`) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`). Our quantitative estimate shows `λ2` is about 5 to 6 times larger than `λ1`, and possibly much more. Therefore, the only option that correctly describes this relationship is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample compartment under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **Constant:** The number density and type of residual gas molecules, and the temperature of the compartment, are constant throughout the scenario.\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of the electrons from the TEM's beam. This describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   **Question:** How does λ₂ compare to λ₁?\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a moving particle sees for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **For λ₁ (molecule-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n        *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a molecule hitting another molecule, let's call it `σ_molecule-molecule` or `σ₁`.\n        *   So, `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`. (Note: A more precise formula includes a √2 factor, `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ₁)`, to account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving. However, this factor doesn't change the fundamental comparison).\n\n    *   **For λ₂ (electron-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are electrons.\n        *   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is the same `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a molecule, let's call it `σ_electron-molecule` or `σ₂`.\n        *   So, `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    *   This is the critical part of the problem. The relationship between λ₁ and λ₂ is inversely determined by the relationship between σ₁ and σ₂.\n    *   `σ₁` (molecule-molecule): This collision is essentially a \"billiard ball\" type of interaction. It's governed by the physical size of the molecules and the short-range van der Waals forces. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must come within a distance roughly equal to the sum of their radii. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecule, approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ₂` (electron-molecule): This is not a simple physical collision. The electron is a point-like charged particle. The gas molecule, while electrically neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. This creates an electric field around the molecule. The incoming beam electron interacts with this electric field via the long-range Coulomb force. The electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes quite far from the \"physical edge\" of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the Coulomb interaction is long-range, an electron is \"aware\" of the molecule's presence from a much larger distance compared to another neutral molecule. This means the effective target area the molecule presents to an electron (`σ₂`) is significantly larger than the effective target area it presents to another molecule (`σ₁`).\n    *   Therefore, `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:**\n    *   We have the two equations:\n        *   `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`\n        *   `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`\n    *   We have established that the number density `n_gas` is the same in both cases.\n    *   We have deduced that `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the cross-section `σ`, a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Because `σ₂` is larger than `σ₁`, it must follow that `λ₂` is smaller than `λ₁`.\n    *   `λ₂ < λ₁`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: This matches our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics predicts a difference.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** The average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ ∝ 1/(nσ).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron colliding with the gas molecules.\n    *   **Given:** The number density (n) of gas molecules and the temperature are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, both the projectile particle (a gas molecule) and the target particles (other gas molecules) are in random thermal motion.\n    *   The standard formula for the mean free path from the kinetic theory of gases, which accounts for the relative motion of all particles, is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ₁` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. The factor `√2` is crucial and arises because the target particles are also moving.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron from a 1000 kV beam. These electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, vastly greater than the thermal velocities of the residual gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electrons are so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered essentially stationary targets.\n    *   The mean free path for a fast particle moving through a field of stationary targets is given by:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n    *   Notice the absence of the `√2` factor. Here, `σ₂` is the total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n    *   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the effective physical size of the gas molecules. It's the \"kinetic diameter\" that matters for low-energy collisions governed by intermolecular forces.\n    *   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is quite different. The electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom (both the nucleus and the atomic electrons). Due to its high energy, the electron can penetrate the electron cloud easily. High-energy scattering cross-sections are generally *smaller* than the low-energy kinetic cross-sections of the molecules themselves. An electron traveling at such a high velocity is less likely to be deflected by a gas molecule than two slow-moving gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ₁ > σ₂**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n    *   Let's divide the equation for λ₂ by the equation for λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ₂)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)]\n    *   Simplifying the expression by canceling `n`:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ₁) / σ₂\n    *   λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ₁ / σ₂)\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have two factors contributing to the ratio:\n        1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** `√2` (which is approximately 1.414). This factor alone, which comes from the gas molecules being stationary targets for the electrons, makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n        2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** `(σ₁ / σ₂)`. Since we established that σ₁ > σ₂, this ratio is greater than 1.\n    *   Combining these, the total ratio λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number greater than 1).\n    *   This means that **λ₂ / λ₁ > √2 ≈ 1.414**.\n    *   Therefore, we must have λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ : This is false, because λ₂ is greater than 1.414 * λ₁.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : This is false.\n    *   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false, as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : This is true. Since our calculation shows that λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁, it is necessarily true that λ₂ is also greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. This option correctly identifies that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda-1):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases. The system is in thermal equilibrium, and all particles (the gas molecules) are of similar mass and are moving.\n*   **λ2 (Lambda-2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. The \"collision\" event here is an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Formula for Mean Free Path (λ)**\n\nThe general concept for mean free path is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective \"area\" a target presents for a collision).\n\nHowever, a crucial refinement is needed when the target particles are also in motion, as is the case for λ1.\n\n### **3. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion, we must account for their relative velocities. The standard formula from the Boltzmann kinetic theory is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with diameter `d`, then `σ_gg = πd²`.\n*   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, which increases the probability of collision compared to a stationary target scenario.\n\n### **4. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor the electrons in the beam, the situation is different:\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic and extremely fast. Their velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. When targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is not used.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The collision is between a tiny, point-like electron and a gas molecule. The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is primarily determined by the size of the gas molecule. Using the same hard-sphere model, a point projectile hitting a sphere of radius `r = d/2` gives a cross-section of `σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4`.\n*   **High Energy Effect:** In reality, the scattering of very high-energy electrons is a quantum mechanical and relativistic process (Mott scattering). The effective cross-section for high-energy electrons (`σ_eg`) is known to be significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two neutral molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\nCombining these points, the formula for the electron's mean free path is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### **5. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nLet's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, let's analyze the two factors in this ratio:\n1.  **The √2 factor:** This is approximately 1.414. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1. It means that even if an electron had the same collision cross-section as a gas molecule, its mean free path would be about 41% longer simply because its targets are stationary.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   From our simple hard-sphere model: `σ_gg = πd²` and `σ_eg = πd²/4`. This gives a ratio of `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n    *   From more advanced physics, the high energy of the electron makes its scattering cross-section `σ_eg` even smaller relative to `σ_gg`. So the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is expected to be significantly greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the total ratio is:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number greater than 1)\n\nAt a minimum, even if we incorrectly assumed `σ_gg = σ_eg`, we would have:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nThis means that λ2 must be at least 1.414 times larger than λ1.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nWe have firmly established that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. Since λ2 is at least 1.414*λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1)\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect. This sets an upper bound that is violated by the physics)\n\nThe physical reality dictates that the electron mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the molecule-molecule mean free path (λ1). Option C is the only one consistent with this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision and thus a shorter mean free path.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: The MFP of Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   In the kinetic theory of gases, when considering the motion of all particles, the formula is slightly modified to account for the relative motion between the colliding molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is essentially determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules. For example, σ_gg ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: The MFP of Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the gas molecules can be considered almost stationary compared to the extremely high-speed electrons (accelerated at 1000 kV, their speed is close to the speed of light). Therefore, the √2 factor (which accounts for target motion) is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The crucial difference between λ₁ and λ₂ lies in their respective collision cross-sections.\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is a \"kinetic\" or \"geometric\" cross-section. It's relatively large because it's based on the physical size of the electron shells of the molecules.\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is a \"scattering\" cross-section. An electron is a fundamental point-like particle. A \"collision\" in this context is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) that significantly deflects the electron from its path. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV), the probability of such an interaction with a light gas atom (like N₂ or O₂) is very low. The electron is moving so fast that it often passes through the atomic electron cloud with negligible interaction. The effective target for the electron is much, much smaller than the physical size of the gas molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **5. Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   We have:\n    *   λ₁ ∝ 1 / (√2 * σ_gg)\n    *   λ₂ ∝ 1 / σ_eg\n*   Since `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg`.\n*   Therefore, λ₂ will be much larger than λ₁.\n    *   **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation:** Incorrect. The physics dictates they must be different.\n*   **B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁:** Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows λ₂ should be *much* larger.\n*   **C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁:** This is the only option that aligns with our conclusion that **λ₂ > λ₁**. Although the actual ratio λ₂/λ₁ is expected to be much greater than 1.22, this statement is mathematically and physically correct because it establishes the correct relationship (λ₂ is larger than λ₁) and provides a lower bound.\n*   **D) λ₂ < λ₁:** Incorrect. This would imply that an electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is contrary to the physics of high-energy scattering.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ₁).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with **other gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is a gas molecule, and the target is also a gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with **gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Components of the MFP Formula:**\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same for both calculations. Therefore, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant in both scenarios.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** This is the key difference.\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules. This represents the effective area for two relatively large, slow-moving molecules to collide. A more precise formula for MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁), where the √2 accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₂, describes the scattering of a high-energy electron by a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, and it is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (accelerated by 1000 kV). It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom. The probability of such a high-energy, small projectile being significantly scattered by the sparse electric field of a single atom is much lower than the probability of two bulky gas molecules physically colliding. Therefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ₂) is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ₁).\n        *   So, we have **σ₂ << σ₁**.\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, it follows that λ₂ must be **much larger** than λ₁.\n    *   λ₂ >> λ₁\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This contradicts our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This statement asserts that λ₂ is at least 22% larger than λ₁. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ₂ is *much* larger than λ₁, this inequality is definitely true.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests that λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows the difference should be orders of magnitude, not a mere 22%.\n    *   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. There is a fundamental physical difference between the two types of collisions, so the mean free paths are expected to be different.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path for a high-energy electron traveling through a gas (λ₂) is significantly greater than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ₁). Option B is the only one that correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual *gas molecules* in the vacuum. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The primary factors are the number density of the gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two molecules (σ_gg, the gas-kinetic cross-section).\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons* traveling through the residual gas. It represents the average distance a 1000 keV electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule. The primary factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section between an electron and a gas molecule (σ_eg).\n\n2.  **Formulate the equations for MFP:**\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a particle in a gas of similar particles is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target gas molecules are also moving, not stationary.\n\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a very fast projectile (like a high-energy electron) moving through a gas of relatively slow-moving molecules is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Here, the √2 factor is omitted because the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary compared to the relativistic speed of the 1000 keV electrons.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. It describes the effective area for a \"billiard ball\" type collision between two neutral molecules. For a typical gas like N2, this is on the order of 10⁻¹⁵ cm².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulombic). The magnitude of this cross-section is highly dependent on the electron's energy.\n        *   For *low-energy* electrons (a few eV), the interaction time is long, and the cross-section can be quite large, sometimes larger than the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n        *   For *high-energy* electrons, such as the 1000 keV (1 MeV) electrons in this TEM, the situation is reversed. The electron is moving at nearly the speed of light. It passes by the gas molecules so quickly that the probability of an interaction (scattering event) is very low. Consequently, the scattering cross-section, σ_eg, for high-energy electrons is *much smaller* than the gas-kinetic cross-section, σ_gg. For 1 MeV electrons, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁸ to 10⁻²⁰ cm², which is orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gg.\n\n4.  **Analyze the relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have established that for this high-energy scenario: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n    *   Let's look at the denominators of the MFP equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg (by several orders of magnitude), the denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n    *   The mean free path is *inversely* proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, since the denominator for λ1 is much larger than for λ2, the resulting MFP λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n    *   Conclusion: **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect. The underlying physics is different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1, which is correct. However, it puts a very small upper bound on the ratio (λ2/λ1 < 1.22). Our analysis showed that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least 1.22. Since our physical analysis showed that λ2 is orders of magnitude larger than λ1 (i.e., λ2 >> λ1), it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1. This statement is consistent with our conclusion.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect. This would only be true if σ_eg were significantly larger than σ_gg, which happens for low-energy electrons, not the 1000 keV electrons in a TEM.\n\nThe physical reality is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons in the residual gas is extremely long (hundreds or thousands of kilometers), which is precisely why the electron beam can travel through the microscope column without significant unwanted scattering. The mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other is also long due to the vacuum, but significantly shorter than that of the electrons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the two scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (determines λ1):** This involves the mean free path of gas molecules within the vacuum chamber before the electron beam is on. The particles colliding are the gas molecules themselves. They are all in random thermal motion.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (determines λ2):** This involves the mean free path of high-energy electrons from the electron beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules. Here, the projectiles are electrons, and the targets are gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general concept for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective area of the target for a collision).\n\n3.  **Calculate λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of its peers, all particles are moving. We need to consider their average *relative* velocity. This introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` into the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n    Therefore, the mean free path for the gas molecules is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n    where `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Calculate λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    When a beam of high-energy particles (electrons) is fired into a gas, the velocity of the electrons is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, meaning the electrons are highly relativistic (moving at over 90% the speed of light). In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered stationary.\n    Because the targets are stationary, the `sqrt(2)` correction factor is not used. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n6.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the effective size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular (van der Waals) forces.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. A high-energy electron (1000 keV) is a tiny, fast-moving charged particle. To it, a neutral gas molecule is mostly empty space. Significant interaction (scattering) only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the atomic electrons. This means the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the high-energy electron is very small.\n    *   Therefore, it is physically certain that the electron-gas scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion on the Ratio:**\n    Since σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1, the ratio λ2 / λ1 becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (a number much larger than 1)\n    This means λ2 / λ1 must be a value much larger than sqrt(2) (which is ≈ 1.414).\n\n    Even in the most conservative and simplified model where we might incorrectly assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, we would get:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.\n    So, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect because our analysis shows λ2 > 1.414*λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Our result, λ2 > 1.414*λ1, satisfies this condition because 1.414 is greater than 1.22. This option correctly captures that the electron's mean free path is significantly longer.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which contradicts the physics of high-energy particle interactions.\n\nThus, the electron beam travels a much longer average distance between collisions than the gas molecules do, meaning λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\nFirst, we need to clearly define the two mean free paths mentioned in the problem:\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. This value describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas-gas collision. This is essentially the effective \"area\" that one molecule presents to another for a collision. It's related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that both the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path related to *electron scattering*. This value describes the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a *gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas collision. This is the effective \"area\" a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron for a scattering event.\n    *   Note: The `√2` factor is not present here because the gas molecules are essentially stationary compared to the extremely high-velocity electrons (accelerated by 1000 kV).\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to compare the two cross-sections: `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules' electron clouds. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. When the electron clouds of two molecules get close enough, they repel and \"collide\".\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a point-like particle, and it's moving at extremely high speed (relativistic speeds at 1000 kV). To this fast electron, an atom or molecule is mostly empty space. A scattering event only happens if the electron passes very close to the dense, positively charged nucleus or interacts with one of the orbital electrons. The probability of such a close encounter is low. Therefore, the effective target area for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is **much smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\n    In summary: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **3. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ)**\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas and our understanding of the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gg.\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_eg.\n\nSince `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg` (`1/σ_gg`). This means λ2 will be much larger than λ1.\n\nLet's look at the ratio to be more precise:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number much greater than 1.\nTherefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be much greater than √2 (which is approximately 1.414).\n\nOur conclusion is: **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options is consistent with our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`):\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** This statement is true. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 times λ1, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.\n*   **B) λ2 < λ1:** This is false.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is false.\n*   **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This is false. Our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`) directly contradicts the upper limit in this option (`λ2 < 1.22*λ1`).\n\nTherefore, the only logically sound conclusion among the choices is A. The electron travels, on average, a much farther distance than a gas molecule before an interaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to compare two different types of mean free paths (MFP) inside a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) vacuum chamber.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This depends on the size of the gas molecules and their concentration (pressure and temperature).\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons (from the microscope's beam) colliding/scattering with the *gas molecules*. This depends on the concentration of gas molecules and the electron-molecule scattering cross-section.\n    *   The key conditions are: high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), high electron energy (1000 kV = 1 MeV), and constant temperature. The constant temperature and pressure mean the number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where *n* is the number density of target particles and *σ* is the collision cross-section.\n    *   For **λ1** (molecule-molecule collisions), the formula is more specifically λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where σ_gg is the gas kinetic cross-section (roughly πd², with *d* being the molecule's diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the gas molecules. σ_gg represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by another molecule. This is like two billiard balls colliding.\n    *   For **λ2** (electron-molecule collisions), the formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by an electron.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" type collision. The size is determined by the electron clouds of the molecules repelling each other. The cross-section is relatively large, on the order of the geometric size of the molecule (e.g., ~10⁻¹⁹ m²).\n    *   **Electron-Molecule (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a tiny, point-like particle. The \"collision\" is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) with the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. A 1000 kV electron is extremely energetic and fast-moving. An atom is mostly empty space to such a particle. The probability of a significant scattering event is much lower than for a molecule-molecule collision. Therefore, the effective target size, σ_eg, is much, much *smaller* than the gas kinetic cross-section, σ_gg.\n    *   **Conclusion:** σ_gg >> σ_eg.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 ∝ 1/σ_gg and λ2 ∝ 1/σ_eg.\n    *   Since the cross-section σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n    *   An electron can travel, on average, a much longer distance than a gas molecule before an interaction occurs. This is precisely why high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy—to make λ2 extremely long so electrons can travel unimpeded from the source to the detector.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The underlying physics and cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states λ2 > λ1, but it puts a very restrictive upper bound on λ2. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* greater than λ1, not just slightly greater. For example, the ratio λ2/λ1 can be on the order of 10³ to 10⁴. So, this statement is false because λ2 will be larger than 1.22*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons are more likely to hit gas molecules than gas molecules are to hit each other, which is physically wrong for high-energy electrons.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly captures the relationship λ2 > λ1. The factor of 1.22 simply sets a lower bound. Since our analysis concludes that λ2 is vastly larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical reality of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor, and the core of the question is the qualitative relationship between the two mean free paths.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). Therefore, λ2 >> λ1, which satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Define λ1\n\n*   **Scenario:** The system initially contains only residual gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) inside a TEM sample compartment.\n*   **λ1:** This is the mean free path (MFP) of these gas molecules colliding *with each other*.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** The standard formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical molecules is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic scattering cross-section for gas-gas collisions (related to the molecule's physical size).\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n*   **Magnitude of λ1:** In an ultra-high vacuum, the number density `n` is extremely low. This means that collisions between gas molecules are very rare, and consequently, λ1 is a very large distance (often hundreds of meters or even kilometers).\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Second State and Define λ2\n\n*   **Scenario:** An electron beam is initiated. The system now contains the residual gas molecules plus a beam of high-energy (1000 kV) electrons.\n*   **The \"Intriguing Observation\":** Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, which is different from λ1. The term \"intriguing\" suggests a non-obvious physical phenomenon.\n*   **Interpreting λ2:** The phrase \"mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules\" is crucial. There are two possible interpretations:\n    1.  λ2 is the MFP of the *beam electrons* as they travel through the gas.\n    2.  λ2 is the new MFP of the *gas molecules*, which are now being constantly bombarded by the electron beam.\n\n    Let's analyze which interpretation makes the observation \"intriguing.\"\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** For a TEM to work, the MFP of beam electrons must be very long to allow them to reach the sample without scattering. Discovering that the electron MFP is very long would be expected, not intriguing.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** The idea that turning on the beam profoundly changes the environment for the gas molecules themselves, altering their behavior and MFP, is a much more subtle and \"intriguing\" physical consequence. This interpretation is more likely the intended meaning.\n\n    Therefore, we will proceed with **λ2 as the mean free path of a gas molecule in the presence of the electron beam.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the New Collision Environment for a Gas Molecule\n\n*   With the beam on, a gas molecule can now collide with two types of particles:\n    1.  Other gas molecules (as before).\n    2.  Electrons from the beam.\n*   The total collision rate (ν_total) for a gas molecule is the sum of the rates of these two types of collisions:\n    ν_total = ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron\n*   The new mean free path, λ2, is the average velocity of the gas molecule divided by this new total collision rate:\n    λ₂ = v_gas / ν_total = v_gas / (ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron)\n*   Since the original MFP was λ₁ = v_gas / ν_gas-gas, we can see that if ν_gas-electron > 0, then ν_total > ν_gas-gas, which directly implies that **λ₂ < λ₁**.\n\n### 4. Quantify the Collision Rates to Confirm the Conclusion\n\nTo be certain, let's compare the magnitude of the two collision rates.\n*   **Gas-Gas collision rate:** ν_gas-gas = n * σ_gg * v_relative_gg ≈ n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2\n*   **Gas-Electron collision rate:** ν_gas-electron = ρ_e * σ_ge * v_relative_ge\n    *   `ρ_e` is the number density of electrons in the beam.\n    *   `σ_ge` is the cross-section for a gas molecule-electron collision.\n    *   `v_relative_ge` is the relative velocity. Since the electrons are relativistic (~0.94c) and the gas molecules are slow (thermal velocities, ~500 m/s), the relative velocity is completely dominated by the electron's velocity: `v_relative_ge ≈ v_electron`.\n\nLet's compare ν_gas-electron with ν_gas-gas.\nThe ratio is (ρ_e * σ_ge * v_electron) / (n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2).\n\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n*   **Densities (ρ_e vs. n):** Even in UHV (n ≈ 10¹³ molecules/m³), the density of electrons in a focused TEM beam is extremely high (ρ_e can be > 10¹⁸ electrons/m³). So, **ρ_e >> n**.\n*   **Velocities (v_electron vs. v_gas):** A 1 MeV electron has a velocity of ~2.8 x 10⁸ m/s, while a gas molecule has a thermal velocity of ~5 x 10² m/s. So, **v_electron >> v_gas**.\n*   **Cross-Sections (σ_ge vs. σ_gg):** The cross-section for a high-energy electron to scatter off a molecule (σ_ge) is generally *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of two molecules colliding (σ_gg), because the atom is mostly empty space to a tiny, fast electron. However, this difference is completely overwhelmed by the vast differences in density and velocity.\n\nThe product (ρ_e * v_electron) is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the product (n * v_gas). This means:\n**ν_gas-electron >> ν_gas-gas**\n\nThe total collision rate is almost entirely determined by the collisions with the beam electrons (ν_total ≈ ν_gas-electron). Since this rate is vastly higher than the original gas-gas collision rate, the mean free path of the gas molecules must be drastically reduced.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe original mean free path λ1 was very large. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules are subjected to a massive bombardment by high-density, high-velocity electrons. This introduces a new, dominant collision mechanism that dramatically increases the total collision frequency for each gas molecule. A higher collision frequency means a shorter average distance traveled between collisions.\n\nTherefore, the new mean free path, λ2, is significantly smaller than the original mean free path, λ1.\n\nλ₂ < λ₁\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem requires a comparison of two different types of mean free paths within the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each one.\n\n**1. Defining the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to an incoming projectile for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the scenario described, the sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature remain constant. This means the number density of gas molecules, `n`, is the same in both situations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n**2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   λ1 is the mean free path for a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n*   The target is a gas molecule.\n*   The relevant cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is the kinetic cross-section. This is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of radius `r`, the cross-section is approximately σ = π * (2r)² = 4πr². It's a measure of the geometric \"target size\".\n\nSo, **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n**3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Scattering**\n\n*   λ2 is the mean free path for a high-energy electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   The projectile is a high-energy electron.\n*   The target is a gas molecule.\n*   The relevant cross-section, let's call it `σ_e-gas`, is the scattering cross-section for an electron-atom/molecule interaction.\n\nThis interaction is fundamentally different. An electron is a charged point particle. The gas molecule consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud. The dominant interaction is the electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n\nCrucially, the Coulomb force is a long-range force. An incoming electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the gas molecule in a geometric sense to be scattered. It can be deflected by the atom's electric field even when passing at a considerable distance. Any such deflection, however small, counts as a scattering event because it removes the electron from the primary beam, affecting the quality of a high-resolution image.\n\nThis means the effective \"target area\" (`σ_e-gas`) that a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than its physical, geometric area (`σ_gas-gas`). The long reach of the Coulomb field makes the atom a much bigger target for a charged particle like an electron than for a neutral particle like another gas molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state:\n\n**σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**\n\n**4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\nSince `n` is the same for both, and `σ_e-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the expression for λ2 is larger than the denominator in the expression for λ1.\n\nA larger denominator results in a smaller value. Consequently:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mean free path of the electrons with respect to scattering by residual gas molecules (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules with respect to each other (λ1). This is because the gas molecules present a much larger effective scattering cross-section to the charged electrons than they do to each other. Mike's observation that the mean free path changed upon initiating the electron beam is correct and expected.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This type of collision is governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path of the *electrons* from the TEM's beam as they travel through the residual gas. It represents the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   A simplified general formula is: `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):**\n    *   **Particles:** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Targets:** Other gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The number of gas molecules per unit volume. This is determined by the vacuum conditions (pressure and temperature) and is constant for both scenarios.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is the effective area that one gas molecule presents to another for a collision. For neutral molecules, this is primarily determined by their physical size (their kinetic diameter). The interaction is a short-range \"billiard ball\" type collision. Because the target molecules are also moving, the formula is refined: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Components for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):**\n    *   **Particles:** High-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n    *   **Targets:** The stationary (relative to the fast electrons) gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** Same as before, as the gas conditions haven't changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event. This is fundamentally different from σ_gg. An electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be scattered by both the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud of the gas molecule. It doesn't need to make \"physical contact\"; it only needs to pass close enough for its trajectory to be significantly deflected.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** Represents a short-range interaction between two neutral bodies. It's related to the molecule's physical radius.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** Represents a long-range Coulomb interaction between a charge (electron) and a neutral (but polarizable) body.\n    *   The long-range nature of the Coulomb force means that an electron can be scattered from a much greater distance than the physical radius of the gas molecule. Therefore, the effective target area for an electron-gas collision is significantly **larger** than the target area for a gas-gas collision.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_eg > σ_gg**. In fact, it's typically much larger.\n\n6.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   `λ1 ≈ 1 / (n * σ_gg)` (ignoring the √2 for a direct comparison of the primary factors)\n    *   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, and we have established that **σ_eg > σ_gg**, it follows logically that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics of the two types of collisions are different, so their MFPs cannot be equal.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: Correct. An electron is more likely to interact with a gas molecule over a given distance than another gas molecule is. This results in a larger interaction cross-section and, consequently, a shorter mean free path for the electron.\n\nThe core principle is that the \"target\" presented by a gas molecule is much larger to an incoming charged electron than it is to another neutral gas molecule. A bigger target means more frequent collisions/scatterings, which means a shorter average distance between them.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem requires us to compare two different mean free paths (MFPs) in the same environment: λ1, the MFP of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules, and λ2, the MFP of a high-energy electron colliding with those same gas molecules.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Mean Free Path (MFP) for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For a gas molecule moving among other identical, moving molecules, the formula is:\n\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with radius `r`, a collision occurs if their centers get within a distance of `2r`. The cross-section is therefore the area of a circle with this radius: σ_gg = π(2r)² = 4πr².\n*   The `√2` factor is included to account for the fact that both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random thermal motion.\n\nSubstituting the cross-section into the formula, we get:\n\n**λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr²)**\n\n### **2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n\nNow we consider a high-energy electron from the beam traveling through the same gas.\n\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n*   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Since an electron's physical radius is negligible compared to a molecule's radius `r`, the effective target radius is just `r`. The cross-section is: σ_eg = πr².\n*   Crucially, the electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning its velocity is extremely high, approaching the speed of light. This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the \"slow-moving\" gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. When the targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is omitted from the MFP formula.\n\nSubstituting the cross-section into the formula, we get:\n\n**λ₂ = 1 / (n * πr²)**\n\n### **3. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * πr²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr²) ]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * 4πr²) / (n * πr²)\n\nBy canceling the common terms (`n`, `π`, and `r²`), we are left with:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4√2\n\nThe Python code calculated this value to be approximately 5.66.\n\nSo, **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mean free path of the electron (λ₂) is about 5.66 times *longer* than the mean free path of a gas molecule (λ₁). This is because the electron presents a much smaller cross-section for collision, and its high speed relative to the gas molecules means it \"sees\" them as stationary targets, further reducing the statistical probability of a collision over a given distance.\n\nBased on our finding that λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁, we can evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁ (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ (Correct, as 5.66 is indeed greater than 1.22)\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n*   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the electron is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n**2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2. Let's apply the formula to both.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n    *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Let `n_gas` be the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   Let `σ_gas-gas` be the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Scattering (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n    *   The moving particles are high-energy electrons.\n    *   The target particles are the same gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of the target gas molecules, `n_gas`, remains the same because the temperature and pressure in the sample compartment have not changed.\n    *   Let `σ_electron-gas` be the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision cross-sections, `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*. Gas molecules are electrically neutral. Collisions between them are primarily short-range interactions, similar to billiard balls colliding. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **`σ_electron-gas`**: This is the *electron scattering cross-section*. The electron is a charged particle, and the gas molecule is composed of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron from the beam interacts with the entire atom/molecule via the long-range **electromagnetic (Coulomb) force**.\n\n**4. The Critical Difference**\n\nThe Coulomb force has a much longer range than the short-range forces governing gas-molecule collisions. An incoming electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or effectively \"collided with\") by the electric field of a gas molecule even when passing at a distance much greater than the molecule's physical radius.\n\nThis means that a gas molecule presents a much larger effective target area to an incoming electron than it does to another neutral gas molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n**`σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion about λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free path equations:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_gas-gas`)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_electron-gas`)\n\nSince `n_gas` is the same for both, and `σ_electron-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the equation for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1. A larger denominator results in a smaller value.\n\nThus, we must have:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being more likely to interact with the residual gas molecules due to its charge, will have a shorter average distance between collisions than the gas molecules will have with each other.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a scenario in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).\n    *   There are two different mean free paths being considered:\n        *   **λ1**: The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard definition of mean free path in a gas.\n        *   **λ2**: The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*.\n    *   The conditions are constant: ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) and the same temperature.\n    *   The question asks for the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   A general formula for MFP is:  `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n        *   The target is another gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is `n`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_gg`. This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces).\n        *   So, `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV).\n        *   The target is a gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is the *same* `n` as before, because the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_eg`.\n        *   So, `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   To compare λ1 and λ2, we need to compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`, since `n` is the same for both.\n    *   The relationship is inverse: if `σ` is larger, `λ` is smaller (more frequent collisions mean shorter travel distance between them).\n    *   So, the core question is: **How does the collision cross-section of a gas-gas collision (`σ_gg`) compare to that of an electron-gas collision (`σ_eg`)?**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gg` vs. `σ_eg`):**\n    *   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Gas):** This is a \"hard-sphere-like\" collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged. The collision effectively happens only when the molecules get very close to each other, on the order of their physical diameters.\n    *   **`σ_eg` (Electron-Gas):** This is a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral, but polarizable, particle (the gas molecule). The interaction is governed by the long-range Coulomb force. The electron is deflected by the electric field of the atom's nucleus (which is positive) and its surrounding electron cloud (which is negative).\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided with\") even when it is far from the gas molecule's center. This makes the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron much larger than its physical size.\n    *   Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   Conclusion: `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Final Derivation:**\n    *   We established `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n    *   We have `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)` and `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is in the denominator for `λ2`, and `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the value of `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n    *   Thus, **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The \"1.22\" factor is a distractor, likely from the non-relativistic de Broglie wavelength formula.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. This would imply the collision cross-sections are the same, which is physically untrue for these two different types of interactions.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for electrons in the residual gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for a particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that the particle presents for a collision.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule moving through other identical gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile and the target molecules are moving. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the gas-gas kinetic collision cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a high-energy electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they have very high kinetic energy (1 MeV) and travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% of the speed of light).\n    *   Compared to these ultra-fast electrons, the gas molecules (at room temperature) are essentially stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not used.\n    *   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n**3. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare the two mean free paths, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is determined by the physical radius of the gas molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. This value is relatively constant and independent of energy in this context.\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is not a physical contact collision. It's an interaction between the electric field of the incoming electron and the electric field of the atom (its nucleus and electron cloud). The cross-section for this interaction is highly dependent on the energy of the incoming electron.\n    *   For low-energy electrons (around 100 eV), the interaction probability is high, and `σ_eg` is at its maximum.\n    *   However, the problem specifies a **1000 kV (1 MeV)** accelerating voltage. At such extremely high, relativistic energies, the electron travels past the gas molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of the electron being significantly scattered. For high-energy charged particles, the scattering cross-section generally decreases as energy increases (roughly proportional to 1/E²).\n    *   Therefore, for the 1000 keV electrons in the TEM, the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (>> 1).\n\nLet's plug this back into our ratio formula:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a large number)\nλ2 / λ1 >> √2\nλ2 >> 1.414 * λ1\n\nThis means that the mean free path of the high-energy electrons (`λ2`) is significantly **longer** than the mean free path of the gas molecules (`λ1`). The electrons travel much farther, on average, before being scattered.\n\n**6. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 -> False.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **True**. Our analysis shows that λ2 is much larger than λ1, so it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> False.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 -> False. This would only be true if the electrons had low energy.\n\nThe number 1.22 is a specific value, but the general physical principle for high-energy electrons provides a clear conclusion that only aligns with option B. Even a simplified model where one might mistakenly assume the cross-sections are equal (`σ_gg ≈ σ_eg`) would yield λ2 ≈ √2 * λ1 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, which also satisfies the condition in B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem requires a conceptual understanding of the mean free path and how it depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n1.  **Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are other gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of gas molecules is `n_gas`.\n    *   The collision is a physical one, governed by short-range van der Waals forces. The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules.\n    *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the moving particles are the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam.\n    *   The target particles are the same residual gas molecules as before. Therefore, their number density `n_gas` is the same as in the first scenario, since the vacuum conditions (pressure, temperature) have not changed.\n    *   The collision, however, is fundamentally different. It is an electrostatic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas atom/molecule (composed of the positive nucleus and the negative electron cloud). This is a long-range Coulomb interaction.\n    *   An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided\") even when passing at a considerable distance from the gas molecule, a distance much larger than the molecule's physical radius.\n    *   This means the effective area for an electron to interact with a gas molecule, `σ_electron-gas`, is much larger than the physical cross-section for two gas molecules to collide, `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Therefore, we have `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   The mean free path for the electrons is λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas).\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n    Since `n_gas` is the same in both equations and we have established that `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, we can compare the two expressions. Because the cross-section `σ` is in the denominator, a larger cross-section leads to a smaller mean free path.\n\n    Given `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, it must be true that:\n    1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) < 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n\n    Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability of an electron scattering off a residual gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding with each other. This is because the electron interacts via the long-range Coulomb force, giving the gas molecule a much larger effective collision cross-section from the electron's perspective. A higher collision probability (larger cross-section) means the average distance between collisions (the mean free path) is shorter. Thus, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). This is a critical reason why an ultra-high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is the standard definition of the mean free path in gas kinetics. The formula is given by:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur, roughly related to its physical size (πd², where d is the molecular diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This refers to the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. The formula is given by:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" like collision. For a collision to occur, the two neutral gas molecules must get very close to each other, such that their electron clouds repel. The interaction is short-range. The cross-section is determined by the kinetic diameter of the molecules.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering (σ_eg):** This is a fundamentally different interaction. The electron is a fast-moving charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud.\n    *   The electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n    *   An electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It only needs to pass close enough for its trajectory to be significantly deflected (scattered) by the electric field of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud.\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to the incoming electron is much larger than its physical size. An electron passing quite far from the molecule can still be scattered.\n\n**3. Conclusion about Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n*   Since the electron-gas interaction is long-range and the gas-gas interaction is short-range, the effective cross-section for electron-gas scattering is significantly larger than the cross-section for gas-gas collision.\n    *   **σ_eg > σ_gg**\n\n*   Now, let's look at the formulas for the mean free path:\n    *   λ is inversely proportional to σ (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n    *   This means that a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path (i.e., collisions are more frequent).\n\n*   Since σ_eg > σ_gg, it follows directly that:\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being a charged particle, is more likely to interact with a residual gas molecule than another gas molecule is. Therefore, its average travel distance between interactions (λ2) will be shorter than the average travel distance for a gas molecule (λ1). The other options, which introduce specific numerical factors or suggest λ2 is larger, contradict this fundamental physical principle.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are comparing two mean free paths in a TEM vacuum chamber.\n    *   $\\lambda_1$: The mean free path of residual gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   $\\lambda_2$: The mean free path of high-energy electrons (from the beam) colliding with the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The conditions (temperature, pressure, gas density) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mean Free Paths ($\\lambda$):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path (MFP) is $\\lambda = 1/(n\\sigma)$, where $n$ is the number density of target particles and $\\sigma$ is the collision cross-section.\n    *   A correction factor is needed when the target particles are also in motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze $\\lambda_1$ (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   This is the standard case from the kinetic theory of gases. The particles (projectiles) and targets are from the same population of gas molecules, all moving with thermal velocities.\n    *   The formula includes a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ to account for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n    *   The collision cross-section, $\\sigma_{gg}$, is determined by the effective size of the molecules. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter $d$, two molecules collide if their centers get within distance $d$. The cross-section is the area of a circle with this radius, so $\\sigma_{gg} = \\pi d^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze $\\lambda_2$ (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the projectiles are high-energy (1000 kV) electrons, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   **Relative Velocity:** The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets. When targets are stationary, the $\\sqrt{2}$ factor is not used.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section ($\\sigma_{eg}$):** This is the critical part of the problem and involves comparing the nature of electron-molecule vs. molecule-molecule interactions.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections ($\\sigma_{eg}$ vs. $\\sigma_{gg}$):**\n    *   **Argument 1 (Simple Geometric Model):** This model is often presented in introductory texts. It treats the particles like billiard balls.\n        *   Molecule-Molecule: A molecule of radius $r$ collides with another of radius $r$. The effective collision radius is $r+r = 2r = d$. The cross-section is $\\sigma_{gg} = \\pi d^2$.\n        *   Electron-Molecule: An electron's physical size is negligible (radius $\\approx 0$). It collides with a molecule of radius $r$. The effective collision radius is $r+0 = r$. The cross-section is $\\sigma_{eg} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (d/2)^2 = (\\pi d^2)/4 = \\sigma_{gg}/4$.\n        *   *If this model were correct*, it would imply $\\sigma_{eg}$ is *smaller* than $\\sigma_{gg}$.\n\n    *   **Argument 2 (Force-Based Model):** This model considers the fundamental forces involved, which is more physically accurate.\n        *   Molecule-Molecule Interaction: Two neutral molecules interact via the very short-range van der Waals force. They must get very close to \"collide\". This results in the standard kinetic cross-section, $\\sigma_{gg}$.\n        *   Electron-Molecule Interaction: An electron is a charged particle. It interacts with a neutral gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic force. The electron's electric field polarizes the molecule (creating a temporary dipole), leading to an attractive force. This interaction can deflect the electron's path from a much greater distance than the physical \"touching\" distance required for molecule-molecule collisions.\n        *   In the context of an electron beam, especially in a high-resolution microscope, any scattering event that causes a deflection can be considered a \"collision\" as it can degrade the image. Because the electrostatic force is long-range, the effective \"target area\" for causing *some* deflection is much larger than the physical size of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, this reasoning suggests the effective electron-gas cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section: $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sigma_{gg}$.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Compare $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$:**\n    *   We have the two formulas:\n        *   $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}$\n        *   $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_{eg}}$\n    *   Let's find the ratio:\n        *   $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1 / (n \\sigma_{eg})}{1 / (\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}{n \\sigma_{eg}} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}}$\n    *   Using the more physically robust force-based model (Argument 2), we concluded that $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sigma_{gg}$. This means the fraction $\\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}}$ is less than 1.\n    *   For $\\lambda_2$ to be less than $\\lambda_1$, we need $\\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}} < 1$, which means $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{gg}$.\n    *   Given that the electrostatic interaction is fundamentally stronger and longer-ranged than the van der Waals interaction, it is plausible that the electron-scattering cross-section is indeed larger than the gas-kinetic cross-section by more than a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section.\n    *   The long-range electrostatic interaction between an electron and a gas molecule leads to a larger effective collision cross-section ($\\sigma_{eg}$) than the short-range interaction between two neutral gas molecules ($\\sigma_{gg}$).\n    *   A larger cross-section for the electrons leads to a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that $\\lambda_2 < \\lambda_1$. The \"intriguing observation\" by Mike is that the tiny electron has a *shorter* mean free path than the much larger gas molecules, which is counter to the simple geometric (\"billiard ball\") intuition but consistent with an understanding of the underlying forces.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   This is the standard definition of mean free path in the kinetic theory of gases. The interaction is between two relatively large, neutral particles (the gas molecules). The collisions are governed by their physical size and short-range intermolecular forces.\n    *   The formula is:  `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * π * d² * n)`\n        *   `d` = kinetic diameter of the gas molecule.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   The term `√2 * π * d²` represents the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   This refers to the average distance an electron from the microscope's beam travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*.\n    *   This interaction is fundamentally different. It involves a very small, point-like charged particle (the electron) interacting with the electrostatic field of a much larger, complex particle (the gas molecule, which consists of a positive nucleus and a negative electron cloud).\n    *   The formula is: `λ₂ = 1 / (σ * n)`\n        *   `σ` = total scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule interaction.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as in the case for λ1).\n\n### **2. Compare the Nature of the Collisions (Cross-Sections)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision/scattering cross-sections. The cross-section (`σ`) is essentially the \"effective target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section (`√2 * π * d²`)**: This is based on the physical size of the molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" model. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must approach each other within a distance equal to their diameter `d`.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (`σ`)**: This is not a simple physical collision. The electron interacts with the long-range electric (Coulomb) field of the gas molecule. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule's nucleus or its electrons. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) just by passing through the atom's electric field, which extends well beyond its physical radius `d`.\n\n### **3. Conclusion on Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n1.  Because the electron interacts via the long-range electrostatic force, the effective target area it \"sees\" (`σ`) is much larger than the physical target area seen by another gas molecule (`√2 * π * d²`).\n2.  Therefore, the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule is significantly larger than the collision cross-section for two gas molecules: `σ > √2 * π * d²`.\n3.  The mean free path is *inversely proportional* to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ). A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely to happen over a given distance, which results in a shorter average path between collisions.\n4.  Since the cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger, the corresponding mean free path (λ2) must be **smaller** than the mean free path for gas-gas collisions (λ1).\n\nThus, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**. Mike's observation is not a discrepancy but a direct consequence of the different physics governing the two types of interactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules colliding with each other*. In this scenario, all particles (the colliding particle and the target particle) are of the same type (gas molecules) and are in thermal motion.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons colliding (scattering) with the residual gas molecules*. In this scenario, the colliding particles (electrons) are very different from the target particles (gas molecules).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   For gas molecules colliding with each other, all particles are moving. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for the relative motion of the particles. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the standard formula.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules. The `√2` (approximately 1.414) factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by a 1000 kV potential. This gives them extremely high kinetic energy, and their velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, far exceeding the thermal velocities of the gas molecules.\n    *   From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets.\n    *   When the colliding particle is much faster than the target particles, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a fast electron moving through a gas is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n6.  **Analyze the Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size (van der Waals diameter, `d`) of the molecules. It is typically modeled as σ_gg ≈ πd².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. It's more complex as it involves the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus. However, for a high-energy electron, the interaction is only significant for very close passes. A simple hard-sphere model would treat the electron as a point particle and the gas molecule as a sphere of radius r = d/2. In this case, the cross-section would be σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4 = σ_gg/4. Other models for high-energy scattering also suggest that σ_eg can be smaller than σ_gg.\n    *   However, for a first-order approximation, it is common to assume the cross-sections are of the same order of magnitude (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio and Conclude**\n    *   **Case 1: Assume similar cross-sections (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg)**. This is the most straightforward comparison based on the kinetic theory models.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n        λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n    *   **Case 2: Use the hard-sphere model (σ_eg ≈ σ_gg/4)**.\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / (σ_gg/4)) = 4√2\n        λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1\n\n    In either case, and in any physically realistic scenario, the removal of the `√2` from the denominator due to the high electron speed is the dominant factor. This means **λ2 is significantly greater than λ1**.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    Our primary estimate is `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1`.\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our estimate of 1.414 is not less than 1.22.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1...: Incorrect. The physics is different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Our calculated value of `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1` satisfies this condition. The number `1.22` is simply a value that is less than the theoretical lower bound of `√2`, making this the only valid choice.\n\nThe key insight is that electrons, being much faster than gas molecules, effectively \"see\" a field of stationary targets, allowing them to travel a longer average distance between collisions compared to a gas molecule moving amongst other moving gas molecules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths in the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each one.\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the sample compartment's vacuum state, volume, and temperature are constant (before and after the beam is on). According to the ideal gas law (P = nkT), the number density of the gas molecules (`n_gas`) remains the same in both scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections (σ).\n\n### 2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ1 represents the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The particles are of similar size and mass, and their collisions are primarily governed by their kinetic size (van der Waals radius). This can be modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or hard-sphere collision.\n*   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ1, is therefore related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter d, the cross-section is σ1 = πd².\n*   A more precise formula for MFP in a gas of identical particles includes a factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the target particles, so λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ1). However, the key component is σ1, the geometric cross-section.\n\n### 3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ2 is defined based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. Here, the moving particle is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target particles are the stationary (in comparison) gas molecules.\n*   The collision here is not a simple physical impact. It is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n*   The range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than the physical size of the molecule. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes at a distance much larger than the molecule's radius.\n*   This means the effective area for an interaction, the electron scattering cross-section (σ2), is significantly **larger** than the geometric collision cross-section of the gas molecules (σ1). The gas molecule presents a much \"bigger target\" to an incoming electron than it does to another gas molecule.\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nWe have:\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ1 (gas-gas geometric cross-section).\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ2 (electron-gas scattering cross-section).\n*   The number density `n_gas` is the same for both calculations.\n\nFrom our analysis, we concluded that the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section:\n\nσ2 > σ1\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n\nTherefore, it must be that:\n\nλ2 < λ1\n\nThe electron, experiencing a larger effective target area for each gas molecule, is much more likely to interact (scatter) and thus travels a shorter average distance between these interactions compared to a gas molecule traveling amongst its peers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path based on electron scattering (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of gas-gas collisions (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas geometric cross-section.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   'n' is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   'σ' (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, within the same sample compartment. Since the compartment volume, temperature, and pressure are constant (before the beam is on), the number density 'n' of the residual gas molecules is the same for both scenarios.\n\n    *   **λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction σ1.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n        (Note: For identical particles in thermal motion, a factor of √2 is often included, i.e., λ = 1/(√2*n*σ), but this detail doesn't change the final comparison.)\n        σ1 is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*, which is related to the physical size (diameter, d) of the gas molecules. The interaction is like a \"billiard ball\" collision. σ1 is approximately πd².\n\n    *   **λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the high-energy beam colliding (or more accurately, scattering) with the stationary gas molecules. Let's call the scattering cross-section for this interaction σ2.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n        σ2 is the *electron scattering cross-section*. This is not determined by the physical size in the same way. It's determined by the electromagnetic interaction between the high-energy electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 boils down to the comparison between σ1 and σ2. From the formulas above:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Kinetic):** Molecules are neutral and interact via short-range forces. The cross-section is determined by their physical size. For a typical gas like N2, the kinetic diameter is about 0.37 nm, leading to a cross-section σ1 of roughly 4 x 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron Scattering):** The electron in the TEM has a very high energy (1000 keV = 1 MeV). High-energy charged particles are extremely penetrating. They can pass very close to or even through an atom without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered significantly). The probability of an interaction, and thus the scattering cross-section σ2, is very small for such energetic electrons. The cross-section for scattering decreases significantly as the electron's energy increases. For a 1 MeV electron scattering off a nitrogen atom, the total cross-section (elastic + inelastic) is on the order of 10⁻²² to 10⁻²³ m².\n\n4.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    We have established that the gas-kinetic cross-section (σ1) is much larger than the high-energy electron scattering cross-section (σ2).\n    σ1 >> σ2\n    In fact, σ1 is several orders of magnitude (thousands of times) larger than σ2.\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 >> 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 >> λ1\n\n    This means the mean free path of the electrons in the residual gas is much, much longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). This contradicts our finding that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because the collision types and cross-sections are vastly different.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that the tiny, high-energy electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is physically wrong.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is at least 22% larger than λ1. Since our physical analysis concluded that λ2 is thousands of times larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physics of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely arbitrary, but the inequality holds true.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is defined by the formula:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles. In this problem, the number density of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios since the temperature, pressure, and volume of the sample compartment are constant.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\nThe problem asks to compare two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nSince `n` is constant, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse of the relationship between their respective collision cross-sections (σ1 and σ2):\n\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nWe need to compare the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions (σ1_effective) with the collision cross-section for electron-gas collisions (σ2_effective).\n\n*   **σ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces). The collision occurs when two molecules get very close to each other. The effective cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. For collisions between identical moving molecules of diameter `d`, the formula for the mean free path includes a √2 factor to account for the movement of all particles:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_kinetic)\n    where σ_kinetic = πd². So, σ1_effective = √2 * πd².\n\n*   **σ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This collision involves a high-energy (1000 keV), negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force between the electron and the atom's charged constituents (the positive nucleus and negative electron cloud). The question is, how does the cross-section for this interaction compare to the gas-kinetic cross-section?\n\n### 3. High-Energy Particle Behavior\n\nA common misconception is that a charged particle will always interact more strongly than a neutral one, leading to a larger cross-section. While the Coulomb force is long-range, the outcome depends critically on the projectile's energy.\n\nHigh-energy particles, such as the 1000 kV electrons in this scenario, are highly relativistic and travel at near the speed of light. They pass by the target gas molecules so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short. This short interaction time reduces the impulse transferred to the molecule (or the electron), meaning the electron must pass very close to the nucleus to be significantly deflected.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, this phenomenon is described as the scattering cross-section decreasing with increasing energy. For high energies, the atom becomes increasingly \"transparent\" to the passing electron. Search results from databases of physical data confirm this:\n*   The gas-kinetic cross-section for a typical molecule like N₂ is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n*   The total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (in the keV to MeV range) on N₂ is on the order of 10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻²² m².\n\nTherefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ2) is significantly **smaller** than the effective gas-gas collision cross-section (σ1).\n\nσ2 < σ1\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and we've established that σ2 < σ1, it follows directly that:\n\nλ2 > λ1\n\nThis conclusion eliminates option **D) λ2 < λ1**. It also makes Mike's observation \"intriguing\" because it's counter-intuitive to the naive assumption that charged particles interact more.\n\n### 5. Choosing Between Options B and C\n\nNow we must decide between:\nB) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1\n\nOur analysis showed that σ2 is not just slightly smaller, but *significantly* smaller than σ1. Let's look at the ratio more formally:\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective = (√2 * πd²) / σ2\n\nFrom the data found, the ratio of the cross-sections (σ1/σ2) can be 10 or even more. This means the ratio of the mean free paths (λ2/λ1) will be large (>> 1.414).\n*   Option C suggests a very tight upper bound: λ2 must be less than 1.22 * λ1. This is inconsistent with the physics of high-energy scattering, which predicts a much larger ratio.\n*   Option B provides a lower bound: λ2 is at least 1.22 * λ1. This is fully consistent with our finding that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. If λ2/λ1 is, for example, 20, then the condition λ2/λ1 >= 1.22 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the physics of the scenario strongly supports option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path of a particle is inversely proportional to its collision cross-section. For a high-energy electron (1000 keV), the scattering cross-section with a gas molecule (σ2) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules (σ1). This is because the high-speed electron has a very short interaction time with the target molecule, making it effectively \"see\" a smaller target. Since σ2 < σ1, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be greater than λ1. The expected ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1, making option B the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **λ₁:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules* colliding with each other. This is the standard definition of mean free path in kinetic theory for a single-component gas.\n    *   **λ₂:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons* from the high-energy beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In a gas where all molecules are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. For a single species of gas molecules following a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the standard formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ_gg, for two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n        where `n` is the number density of the gas molecules and `d` is their effective diameter.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy electron (1000 kV) and the target is a gas molecule. The speed of the electron is extremely high, approaching the speed of light, while the gas molecules at room temperature have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 factor (which accounts for relative motion between *two sets* of moving particles) is not applicable here.\n    *   The collision involves an electron (which is, for practical purposes, a point particle in terms of size) and a gas molecule (of diameter `d`). The collision cross-section, σ_eg, is determined by the size of the gas molecule. The effective area for a collision is πr², where `r` is the radius of the molecule (`r = d/2`).\n    *   So, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule is σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₂ is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (πd²/4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n5.  **Compare λ₂ and λ₁:**\n    Now we establish a ratio between λ₂ and λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   We know that √2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   So, λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n    Let's check this result against the given options:\n    *   A) λ₂ = λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁ : Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ₁). This is due to two factors:\n1.  **Stationary Targets:** The electrons are moving so fast that the gas molecules are effectively stationary, which removes the √2 term from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~1.41x).\n2.  **Smaller Collision Cross-Section:** The effective target area for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is smaller than for two molecules hitting each other (increasing MFP by a factor of 4 in the simple hard-sphere model).\n\nBoth effects combined lead to a much larger mean free path for the electrons. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Concept of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for MFP is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem presents two different scenarios for calculating the mean free path in the same sample compartment, meaning the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is the same in both cases.\n\n**Scenario 1: Molecule-Molecule Collisions (λ₁)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Target particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   Since both the moving and target particles are in motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator.\n*   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`). This is related to the physical size of the molecules (their kinetic diameter).\n*   The formula for λ₁ is: **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n**Scenario 2: Electron-Molecule Collisions (λ₂)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** High-energy electrons from the TEM beam (1000 kV).\n*   **Target particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   Since the electrons are extremely fast compared to the relatively slow-moving gas molecules, the gas molecules can be considered stationary. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_electron-gas`).\n*   The formula for λ₂ is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **3. Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n\nSimplifying by canceling `n`:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **σ_gas-gas:** This is the kinetic cross-section, essentially the physical \"target size\" one molecule presents to another. It's on the order of the molecule's geometric area.\n*   **σ_electron-gas:** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. The electron in the TEM has an extremely high energy (1000 keV, or 1 MeV). Such a high-energy particle is highly penetrating. It \"zips\" past the gas molecules with very little time for interaction. The probability of it being significantly deflected (a \"collision\") is very low. This means it has a very small effective collision cross-section.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule's kinetic cross-section:\n\n**σ_electron-gas << σ_gas-gas**\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nNow, let's substitute this finding back into our ratio equation:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\nSince `σ_gas-gas` is much larger than `σ_electron-gas`, the ratio `(σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\n\nThis means:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a large number) >> √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nSo, λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁, and the upper limit is less than the theoretical minimum ratio of √2 (which would occur if the cross-sections were equal).\n*   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: **Correct**. Since we have firmly established that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁ (λ₂ >> 1.414 * λ₁), it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ₁. This is the only statement that aligns with the physical reality.\n*   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics of the two types of collisions are different, so the MFPs must also be different.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the rate of scattering events between electrons and gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. However, a correction factor is needed when the target particles are also in motion.\n\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** The gas molecules are all moving at thermal velocities. To account for their relative motion, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n        `λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (gas-kinetic cross-section).\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them travel at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). This velocity is orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. The `sqrt(2)` factor is not needed.\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as for λ1).\n        *   `σ_eg` = the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gg`: This is the standard gas-kinetic cross-section. It's related to the physical size of the molecules, often modeled as `πd²` where `d` is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ_eg`: This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a molecule. A high-energy (1000 keV) electron is a point-like particle with a very short de Broglie wavelength. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. At such high energies, the electron is more likely to pass through the atomic structure with only a small deflection rather than having a hard \"collision\". The quantum mechanical scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) for such high-energy particles is generally *smaller* than the simple geometric/kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Ratio λ2 / λ1:**\n    We have `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`.\n    *   `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is smaller than `σ_gg`, the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is a value greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the total ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be greater than `sqrt(2) * 1`, which means `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion:**\n    Our analysis shows that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1. Specifically, `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Now we check this against the given options:\n\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our calculated lower bound is ~1.414)\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. If `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, then it is certainly also `>= 1.22 * λ1`)\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n\n    The primary reasons for λ2 being larger than λ1 are:\n    1.  The absence of the `sqrt(2)` factor in the λ2 equation (because the electrons are much faster than the gas molecules).\n    2.  The smaller scattering cross-section of a high-energy electron compared to the kinetic cross-section of a gas molecule.\n\nBoth effects increase the mean free path for the electrons compared to that of the gas molecules. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define λ1:** The problem states that λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves before the electron beam is active. This path is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules. The mean free path (MFP) in this case is given by the formula:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Define λ2:** The problem states that λ2 is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam, which is determined by the electrons scattering off the gas molecules.\n\n3.  **Initial (Naive) Analysis:** A first-level analysis would compare a single electron projectile with a single gas molecule target.\n    *   An electron is a tiny, point-like particle.\n    *   A gas molecule (like N2 or O2) is much larger.\n    *   A high-energy (1000 kV) electron is moving extremely fast and sees the gas molecule as mostly empty space. For the electron to be scattered, it must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron.\n    *   In contrast, two gas molecules are like two large, fluffy balls that collide if their outer electron clouds touch.\n    *   This implies that the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a neutral molecule (σ_e-neutral) is much *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (σ_gg).\n    *   If this were the whole story, since MFP is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section would lead to a longer mean free path. This would mean λ2 >> λ1. However, the problem describes an \"intriguing observation,\" suggesting a more complex phenomenon is at play.\n\n4.  **The Critical Effect of the Electron Beam:** The key to solving this problem lies in understanding what happens \"upon initiating the electron beam.\" A high-energy electron beam is a powerful source of ionization. As the electrons in the beam travel through the sample chamber, they will collide with and strip electrons from the residual gas molecules, creating positive ions.\n    *   **Initial state (beam off):** The chamber contains only neutral gas molecules.\n    *   **Operating state (beam on):** The chamber contains a mixture of neutral gas molecules and positive gas ions. The electron beam is now traveling through this partially ionized gas (a plasma).\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the Cross-Sections:** We must now consider the new composition of the target gas.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ1 (molecule-molecule) remains `σ_gg`, as this is the baseline state.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ2 is now the *effective* cross-section for an electron scattering off the mixture of neutrals and ions.\n    *   The scattering cross-section for a charged particle (the electron) interacting with another charged particle (the gas ion) is governed by the long-range and strong Coulomb force. This electron-ion cross-section (`σ_e-ion`) is vastly *larger* than both the electron-neutral cross-section (`σ_e-neutral`) and the neutral molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n    *   Even if only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized, their enormous scattering cross-section can dominate the overall scattering process for the electron beam. The effective scattering cross-section, `σ_effective`, becomes significantly larger than `σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 is inversely proportional to the kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n    *   λ2 is inversely proportional to the effective cross-section `σ_effective`.\n    *   Since the beam's ionization effect makes `σ_effective` > `σ_gg`, the mean free path for the electrons will be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules.\n    *   A larger cross-section means collisions are more frequent, leading to a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that λ2 < λ1.\n\nThis phenomenon, where the beam itself creates ions that in turn increase the scattering rate and degrade the beam, is a well-known issue in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, often referred to as ion trapping or beam-induced pressure rise.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The ionization of residual gas by the electron beam drastically increases the scattering cross-section encountered by the electrons. This larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The fundamental formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n\n*   **λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **Particle:** A gas molecule.\n    *   **Target:** Other gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules in the chamber.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ1`):** The effective area for two gas molecules to collide. Because both molecules have a significant size, this cross-section is relatively large. From kinetic theory, for identical spheres of diameter `d`, this is `σ1 = πd²`.\n    *   The full formula from kinetic theory for a gas of identical particles is `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`. The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of all molecules (they are all moving targets).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   **Particle:** An electron.\n    *   **Target:** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules, which is the **same** as in the first case, since the vacuum state itself has not changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ2`):** The effective area a gas molecule presents for a collision with an electron.\n    *   The formula is `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`. The `√2` factor is not used here because the electrons are moving at extremely high speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the collision cross-section.\n\n*   **For `σ1` (molecule-molecule):** Imagine two billiard balls of diameter `d` colliding. For a collision to occur, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the center of the other. This gives an effective target area of `πd²`.\n*   **For `σ2` (electron-molecule):** Now imagine a point-like particle (the electron) colliding with a billiard ball of diameter `d`. The electron has a negligible physical radius compared to the molecule. For a collision to occur, the electron must hit the physical area of the molecule, which is `πr²` or `π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`.\n\nTherefore, based on this simple geometric (hard-sphere) model:\n`σ1 = πd²`\n`σ2 = (1/4)πd²`\nThis means `σ1 = 4 * σ2`, or `σ2 = σ1 / 4`.\n\nThe cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (`σ2`) is significantly smaller than the cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (`σ1`).\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths (λ2 / λ1)**\n\nNow, let's substitute the formulas and the relationship between the cross-sections:\n\n*   `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`\n*   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ1)]`\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ1) / (n * σ2)`\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ1 / σ2)`\n\nNow, using our finding that `σ1 ≈ 4 * σ2`:\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4`\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656`\n\nSo, `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the mean free path for an electron in the gas (`λ2`) is significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`), by a factor of approximately 5.66.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`: Our result `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1` fits this condition.\nB) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1`: Our result does not fit this condition.\nC) `λ2 < λ1`: This is the opposite of what we found.\nD) `λ2 = λ1`: This contradicts the fundamental physics.\n\nThe only plausible conclusion is that `λ2` is substantially larger than `λ1`. Option A correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam. It represents the average distance an electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision/scattering cross-section (σ). The general form is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In the case of gas molecules colliding with each other, both the projectile and the target are moving. This requires a correction factor of √2 in the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ_gg (gas-gas), is determined by the effective kinetic diameter of the neutral gas molecules. This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision model.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is an electron accelerated to a very high energy (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively stationary gas molecule (its thermal velocity is negligible compared to the electron's speed). Because the targets are effectively stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n    *   The scattering cross-section, let's call it σ_eg (electron-gas), is fundamentally different from σ_gg. An electron is a point charge, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to \"physically hit\" the molecule. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) by passing through the molecule's electron cloud or near its positively charged nucleus.\n    *   This long-range interaction means the effective \"target area\" that an electron sees (σ_eg) is much larger than the physical \"hard-sphere\" size of the molecule (which determines σ_gg).\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We have established a key physical difference: The scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is much larger than the collision cross-section for two molecules hitting each other. So, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. In fact, σ_eg is significantly larger.\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the two equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1 = √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2 = n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_eg is much larger than σ_gg, it is certain that n * σ_eg is greater than √2 * n * σ_gg.\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Since the denominator of λ2 is larger than the denominator of λ1, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability of an electron interacting (scattering) with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding. This is because the electron's charge allows it to interact with the molecule over a much larger effective area (larger scattering cross-section). A higher probability of interaction means the average distance between interactions (the mean free path) will be shorter. Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) will be less than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis is an excellent question that delves into the physics of particle interactions within a vacuum, specifically comparing collisions between gas molecules and collisions between electrons and gas molecules. Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the MFP of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Mean Free Path λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n        This is the scenario *before* the electron beam is turned on. We are considering a gas molecule moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   The moving particles and target particles are identical (gas molecules).\n        *   The number density of target molecules is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section, `σ1`, is the cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`). This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n        *   Because the target molecules are also moving with a similar range of thermal speeds, kinetic theory adds a factor of `sqrt(2)` to the denominator.\n        *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Mean Free Path λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n        This is the scenario *after* the electron beam is turned on. We are considering an electron from the high-energy beam colliding with a stationary gas molecule.\n        *   The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is the same, `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section, `σ2`, is the cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_e-gas`).\n        *   In this case, the electrons are moving at a very high velocity (at 1000 kV, their speed is close to the speed of light), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can approximate the gas molecules as being stationary targets. Thus, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n        *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)**\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\n\n    This is the core of the problem. We need to compare the effective \"target area\" of a gas molecule as seen by another gas molecule versus as seen by a high-energy electron.\n\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" collision. One neutral molecule has to get very close to another for their electron clouds to repel and cause a collision. The cross-section is determined by the physical radius of the molecules. `σ_gas-gas ≈ π * d²`, where `d` is the molecular diameter.\n\n    *   **`σ_e-gas`**: This is an electromagnetic interaction (Coulomb scattering). The electron is a charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron from the beam can be deflected (scattered) by interacting with this electric field from a much larger distance than the physical radius of the molecule.\n    *   In the context of a TEM, any scattering event, even a very small-angle one, can be detrimental to forming a high-resolution image. Therefore, the \"effective\" cross-section includes all these long-range interactions.\n    *   Because of this long-range Coulomb interaction, the target presented to an electron is much, much larger than the physical target presented to another neutral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **`σ_e-gas` >> `σ_gas-gas`** (the electron-gas cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas cross-section).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion on λ1 vs. λ2**\n\n    Let's compare the two expressions:\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)\n\n    We know that `σ_e-gas` is significantly larger than `σ_gas-gas`. This means the denominator in the expression for λ2 (`n_gas * σ_e-gas`) is much larger than the denominator in the expression for λ1 (`√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas`).\n\n    Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the denominator, a much larger denominator results in a much smaller mean free path.\n\n    Therefore, **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n    Mike's observation is not a discrepancy but a direct consequence of the different nature of electron-gas and gas-gas interactions. The stringent vacuum requirements in electron microscopes exist precisely because electrons are so easily scattered by residual gas molecules (i.e., `λ2` is relatively short and must be maximized by reducing `n_gas` as much as possible).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule-Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ1** represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this scenario, all particles (the projectile molecule and the target molecules) are moving at similar thermal speeds.\n*   Physics accounts for the movement of *all* particles by introducing a factor of √2 in the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_gg** (gas-gas), is the \"effective target area\" for a collision between two molecules. It's related to the physical diameter (d) of the molecules, approximately σ_gg ≈ πd².\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n    **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2: Electron-Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ2** represents the mean free path of a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the electron is the projectile, and the gas molecules are the targets. The electron is moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), which is orders of magnitude faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Because the electron's velocity (v_e) is much greater than the gas molecule's velocity (v_g), we can treat the target molecules as being stationary. This means the √2 factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_eg** (electron-gas), represents the effective target area for an electron to be significantly scattered by a gas molecule. High-energy electrons interact with the electromagnetic fields of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. To a tiny, fast-moving electron, an atom consists of mostly empty space. Therefore, the probability of a scattering event is relatively low, and the scattering cross-section **σ_eg** is significantly *smaller* than the physical collision cross-section **σ_gg**.\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n    **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\n### **4. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nNow we can compare the two expressions by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of this ratio:\n\n1.  **The Velocity Factor (√2):** This factor is approximately 1.41. It arises because the gas molecules are treated as stationary targets for the fast electron, removing the √2 term from the denominator for λ2. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1 (assuming equal cross-sections).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):** As established, the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg) is significantly larger than the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) because an atom is mostly empty space to a high-energy electron. This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the mean free paths is the product of these two factors:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (a number ≈ 1.41) * (a number > 1)\n\nThis definitively means that **λ2 / λ1 > 1.41**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (i.e., ratio = 1). Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (i.e., 1 < ratio < 1.22). Incorrect, as the ratio must be greater than 1.41.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (i.e., ratio >= 1.22). **This is the only option consistent with our finding that the ratio is greater than 1.41.** The value 1.22 is a lower bound that is satisfied by the physics.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (i.e., ratio < 1). Incorrect.\n\nThe electron, being a small and extremely fast particle, experiences far fewer scattering events over a given distance compared to a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Therefore, its mean free path (λ2) will be significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The system consists of randomly moving gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam*. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*. The system consists of a high-velocity, directional electron beam traveling through a sparse medium of relatively stationary gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mean Free Path Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section. This represents the effective area that one particle presents to another for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**:\n        The standard kinetic theory formula for a gas is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   `n` is the density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is roughly based on the physical size of the molecules (like two billiard balls colliding).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**:\n        The formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n        *   `n` is the same density of gas molecules, as they are the targets.\n        *   `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent because the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    This is the core of the problem. We need to compare `σ_gas-gas` with `σ_e-gas`.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gas-gas):** This interaction is largely a \"hard-sphere\" collision, governed by van der Waals forces. The interaction range is short, and the cross-section is related to the physical, geometric size of the molecule.\n\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_e-gas):** This interaction is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron is scattered by both the negatively charged electron cloud and the positively charged nucleus of the gas molecule. Because the Coulomb force has a very long range, an electron can be significantly deflected (which counts as a scattering event) even if it passes relatively far from the \"physical\" boundary of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective area for scattering an electron (due to the long-range Coulomb force) is much larger than the effective area for two neutral gas molecules to collide (which requires them to get very close to each other).\n    Therefore: **σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**\n\n5.  **Final Deduction**\n    *   We have the relationships:\n        *   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gas-gas (and n).\n        *   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_e-gas (and n).\n    *   The number density `n` is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is significantly larger than σ_gas-gas, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be significantly smaller than λ1.\n    *   If σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas, then 1/(n * σ_e-gas) < 1/(n * σ_gas-gas).\n    *   Even accounting for the √2 factor in the λ1 equation, the much larger electrostatic cross-section for the electron ensures this inequality holds.\n    *   Therefore, we can firmly conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\nThis aligns with the practical reason for needing an ultra-high vacuum in an electron microscope: electrons are very easily scattered by residual gas molecules (large cross-section, short mean free path), which would otherwise degrade the beam and the resulting image.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a vacuum chamber with a very low density of gas molecules.\n    *   We need to compare two different \"mean free paths\" (MFP).\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of a gas molecule before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the TEM beam before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*.\n    *   The conditions (temperature, T, and number density of gas molecules, n) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle traveling through a medium of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision):**\n    *   This is the standard case from gas kinetic theory. The particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the targets are also the same gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the projectile and the target are moving with thermal velocities, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   So, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding. This is roughly determined by the physical size of the molecules, approximately σ_gas-gas ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are moving at near the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can therefore consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_electron-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    To compare them, let's take the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_electron-gas):**\n    *   **σ_gas-gas:** This represents a \"hard-sphere\" type collision between two neutral molecules. The interaction forces (van der Waals forces) are short-range. The cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecule, typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **σ_electron-gas:** This describes the scattering of a very high-energy, point-like charged particle (the electron) by the electromagnetic field of an atom/molecule. The electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, making it highly relativistic and extremely fast.\n    *   A key concept in particle physics is that as a particle's energy increases, matter becomes more \"transparent\" to it. The interaction time between the fast-moving electron and the gas molecule is incredibly short. This means the probability of a scattering event (and thus the scattering cross-section, σ_electron-gas) is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section of the molecule. The electron is more likely to zip right past or through the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction than another, slower, bulkier molecule is.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas**. In fact, for 1 MeV electrons, σ_electron-gas is typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gas-gas.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the ratio: λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n    *   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   Since σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas, the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, λ₂ / λ₁ must be greater than √2 * 1, which means:\n        **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n    *   This result shows that the mean free path of the high-energy electron is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules. The electrons travel, on average, a much farther distance before an interaction.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This inequality is satisfied by our derived result (λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁). If a number is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than or equal to 1.22. This is the only physically consistent option.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Our result shows λ₂ is much larger than this upper bound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Define λ1 and λ2 based on the formula:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. The incoming particle is a gas molecule, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_gas-gas`.\n        *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   (Note: The full formula for identical particles includes a √2 factor, λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas), to account for the relative motion of the target particles. However, for this comparison, the core relationship depends on the cross-section, so we can omit the constant factor without changing the conclusion.)\n\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The incoming particle is an electron, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_e-gas`.\n        *   So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states that the conditions in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same when measuring λ1 (before the beam is on) and λ2 (when the beam is on).\n    *   This means the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends solely on the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections (`σ_gas-gas` and `σ_e-gas`).\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 < λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` < `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 > λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` = `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 = λ1.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gas-gas` vs. `σ_e-gas`):**\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas` (Kinetic Cross-Section):** This describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is short-range, primarily occurring when the molecules get physically close enough for their electron clouds to repel each other. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision, and the cross-section is related to the physical diameter of the molecules (σ ≈ πd²).\n\n    *   **`σ_e-gas` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, charged particle (the electron) and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is governed by the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It can be deflected (elastic scattering) or transfer energy to excite or ionize the molecule (inelastic scattering) from a significant distance. Because of this long-range force, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than its physical size.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Due to the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the probability of an electron interacting with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two neutral gas molecules interacting over the same distance.\n    *   This means the electron-gas collision cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section: `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1** is the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2** is the mean free path (MFP) of beam electrons scattering off the same gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both projectile and target populations are identical and moving according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a correction factor of `√2` is introduced to account for their relative motion.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is related to the physical size of the molecules (e.g., their van der Waals radius).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively slow-moving (or effectively stationary) gas molecule.\n    *   Because the electrons are moving much, much faster than the gas molecules, we can consider the gas molecules as stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` correction factor for relative motion of identical particle populations does not apply.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\n    By simplifying the expression, we get:\n    **λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_e-gas**\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\n    *   **σ_gas**: This represents the kinetic cross-section. It's the effective area that one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur. It's related to the physical size of the electron shells.\n    *   **σ_e-gas**: This represents the scattering cross-section. A 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic. It can pass through the electron cloud of an atom without significant deflection. To be scattered, it needs to interact strongly with the nucleus or the inner-shell electrons. This means the effective target area an atom presents to a high-energy electron is generally *smaller* than the kinetic target area it presents to another, much slower molecule.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that **σ_gas > σ_e-gas**. This means the ratio `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas)` is greater than 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas / σ_e-gas).\n    *   We know that `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We also established that `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   This definitively means that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our analysis shows λ2 must be greater than 1.414*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since our result is that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, it certainly satisfies the condition `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`. The number 1.22 is a lower bound that is well within the physically derived result.\n\nIn summary, the mean free path for an electron is longer for two reasons:\n1.  The electron is treated as a fast projectile hitting stationary targets, which removes the `√2` factor from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~41%).\n2.  The high-energy electron has a smaller scattering cross-section than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules, further increasing its mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n*   **Analysis of λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment.\n    *   This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially determined by the physical size (diameter) of the molecules (`σ_gg = π * d²`, where d is the molecular diameter). It represents a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n\n*   **Analysis of λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of the electrons from the high-energy beam.\n    *   This is the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n*   **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    1.  **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged and can be approximated as a physical \"billiard ball\" collision. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecules.\n    2.  **Electron-Gas Collision (σ_eg):** This is a collision between a high-energy charged particle (the electron) and a neutral atom/molecule. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the gas molecule in a billiard-ball sense. Instead, it interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom, which consists of the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud. This is primarily a Coulombic interaction (scattering).\n    3.  **Key Difference:** The range of the Coulomb interaction is much longer than the range of the forces governing hard-sphere collisions between neutral molecules. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even when passing at a relatively large distance from the atom's nucleus. Consequently, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-sectional area it presents to another gas molecule (`σ_gg`).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (`σ_eg > σ_gg`), the denominator in the mean free path formula for electrons is larger.\n    *   `λ1 = 1 / (constant * σ_gg)`\n    *   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Since `σ_eg > σ_gg` and `n` is the same for both scenarios, it follows that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths within the same environment (the TEM sample chamber):\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. This is a standard kinetic theory of gases problem.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formulas:** The formula for mean free path depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n    *   **For gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1):** The particles are all of similar mass and are in thermal motion, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (gas-gas).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n\n    *   **For high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules (λ2):** The electrons are projectiles with a very high, uniform velocity, much greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary. The formula for the MFP simplifies to:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule (electron-gas).\n        *   Note the absence of the `√2` factor because the targets are essentially stationary relative to the projectile.\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio between λ2 and λ1:** We can find the relationship between the two MFPs by dividing the equation for λ2 by the equation for λ1:\n    (λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    The number density `n` cancels out, leaving:\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. For a collision to occur, the two molecules, which are relatively large objects, must come close enough to interact.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This describes the probability of a high-energy (1000 keV) electron scattering off a gas molecule. The electron is a point-like particle moving at nearly the speed of light. Its interaction with the gas molecule is an electromagnetic event (scattering from the nucleus or the electron cloud). For high-energy projectiles, the scattering cross-section is known to decrease significantly with increasing energy. A very fast electron has a low probability of being deflected; it can easily \"zip through\" the atomic structure. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron is much smaller than the target area it presents to another molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The gas-gas kinetic cross-section is significantly larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section. Thus, `σ_gg > σ_eg`, which means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number greater than 1.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg).\n    *   We know `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We know `(σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 must be greater than 1.414 * 1.\n    *   So, we can confidently state: **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**, or **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: This is consistent with our finding that λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1. If a value is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than 1.22. This statement must be true.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1: This is false, as it sets an upper bound of 1.22, while our calculated lower bound is ~1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n\nThe only statement that holds true based on the physics is A. The mean free path of an electron in the gas is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this scenario, all particles (the gas molecules) are in random thermal motion. The standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases for this case is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial. It arises from averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for *all* colliding particles, accounting for their relative motion.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of an Electron**\n    This refers to the average distance an electron from the TEM beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule. In this scenario, we have a very high-speed projectile (the electron) moving through a collection of comparatively slow-moving targets (the gas molecules).\n    *   The electron is accelerated by 1000 kV, giving it extremely high velocity (a significant fraction of the speed of light).\n    *   The gas molecules have only their normal thermal velocities, which are orders of magnitude smaller.\n    *   Because the electron is so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered **stationary targets**.\n\n    When the targets are stationary, the formula for the mean free path simplifies, and the `√2` factor is not present:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n### **3. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nNow we need to consider the relationship between the molecule-molecule cross-section (σ_gg) and the electron-molecule cross-section (σ_eg).\n\n*   **Simplifying Assumption:** In many physics problems of this type, the primary concept being tested is the difference in the physics of motion (the `√2` factor). If we make the simplifying assumption that the effective cross-sections are approximately equal (i.e., σ_gg ≈ σ_eg), then the equation becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n    Since √2 ≈ 1.414, this means λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n*   **Geometric Model:** We can also use a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model.\n    *   **σ_gg:** For two molecules of diameter `d` to collide, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the other. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `d`, so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n    *   **σ_eg:** For a point-like electron to collide with a molecule of diameter `d` (radius `r = d/2`), it must hit the geometric profile of the molecule. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²**.\n    *   Therefore, in this model, σ_gg = 4 * σ_eg.\n    *   Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg) = √2 * (4 * σ_eg / σ_eg) = 4√2\n    *   In this case, λ2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 * λ1 = 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### **4. Draw a Conclusion**\n\nBoth analyses, despite their different assumptions about the cross-section, lead to the same conclusion: **λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.**\n\n*   The first analysis gives λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n*   The second analysis gives λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA) λ2 < λ1  (False)\nB) λ2 = λ1  (False)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (False, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than 1.22)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (True, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nThe fundamental physical difference is that the fast electron travels through a gas of effectively stationary targets, which reduces its collision frequency compared to a gas molecule moving among its peers. This leads to a longer mean free path. Both simple models show that λ2 is at least √2 times λ1. The value 1.22 is chosen to be a threshold that is clearly smaller than √2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at a high voltage (1000 kV) under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** The mean free path of the *remaining gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard gas kinetic definition of the mean free path. This happens *before* the electron beam is active.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** The mean free path related to the *electron beam scattering off the gas molecules*. This is the average distance an electron travels before it interacts with a gas molecule. This is observed *after* the electron beam is turned on.\n    *   **Constant Condition:** The temperature and, by extension, the number density (`n`) of the gas molecules in the chamber remain the same.\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ2 and λ1?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Calculate/Define λ1:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a gas molecule moving through other gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is basically a \"hard sphere\" collision, determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter, `d`) of the molecules. We can approximate σ_gg ≈ πd².\n\n4.  **Calculate/Define λ2:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a high-energy electron moving through the gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The gas molecules, at room temperature, are moving extremely slowly in comparison. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   This is the crucial step. The relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relationship between their respective denominators, specifically `√2 * σ_gg` versus `σ_eg`.\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule Interaction (for σ_gg):** Neutral gas molecules interact via very short-range forces (van der Waals forces). The collision is like two billiard balls hitting. The cross-section `σ_gg` is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Molecule Interaction (for σ_eg):** An electron is a charged particle. It interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. The electron is repelled by the molecule's electron cloud and attracted by its atomic nuclei. Because this force has a much longer range than the van der Waals force, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\") even when it passes quite far from the molecule's physical boundary.\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective target area that a molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-section it presents to another molecule (`σ_gg`). Therefore, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. It is also much larger than `√2 * σ_gg` (since √2 is only ~1.414).\n\n6.  **Final Comparison of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (n * √2 * σ_gg)\n        *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We established that the denominator for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1, because σ_eg > √2 * σ_gg.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we must conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor related to the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, which is not relevant here.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This matches our physical reasoning. The mean free path for an electron scattering in a gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules scattering amongst themselves because the electron-gas interaction cross-section is much larger.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The two physical processes (molecule-molecule collision vs. electron-molecule scattering) are fundamentally different, so there is no reason to expect their mean free paths to be equal.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula depends on the number density (`n`) of target particles and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nThis formula is for a beam of particles moving through stationary targets. Adjustments are needed if the target particles are also moving.\n\n### **2. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles:** The moving particles are gas molecules, and the targets are other identical gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume, which we can call `n_gas`. This is determined by the pressure and temperature in the chamber and is the same for both scenarios.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₁`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. In a simplified hard-sphere model, we consider molecules with diameter `d`. A collision occurs if the center of one molecule comes within a distance `d` of the center of another. The collision cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d`.\n    *   `σ₁ = σ_gas-gas = πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: In a gas, all molecules are in random thermal motion at comparable speeds. This fact introduces a correction factor of `√2` to account for the movement of both the projectile and target particles.\n*   **Formula for λ₁**:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n\n### **3. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles**: The moving particles are high-energy electrons from the TEM beam, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The target density is the same as before, `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₂`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule.\n    *   An electron is a point particle compared to a gas molecule. A collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r` (the molecule's radius) of the molecule's center. Since `r = d/2`, the cross-section is:\n    *   `σ₂ = σ_electron-gas = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at relativistic speeds (over 90% the speed of light). The thermal velocity of gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary targets. The `√2` correction factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ₂**:\n    *   λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) = 1 / (n_gas * (1/4)πd²)\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow, let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / ((1/4) * n_gas * πd²) = 4 / (n_gas * πd²)\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n_gas * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²) ]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n√2 ≈ 1.414\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis shows that `λ₂` is significantly larger than `λ₁`. The reasons are twofold:\n1.  The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (`σ₂`) is about 4 times smaller than for two gas molecules hitting each other (`σ₁`).\n2.  The lack of a `√2` correction factor for `λ₂` further increases its value relative to `λ₁`.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our result `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> **Incorrect**.\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> **Incorrect**, as 5.66 is much larger than 1.22.\nC) λ2 < λ1 -> **Incorrect**.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **Correct**. Our calculated value of 5.66 * λ₁ is clearly greater than 1.22 * λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is an analysis of the provided answers to determine the most consistent conclusion.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\n1.  **Defining λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The kinetic theory of gases provides the formula:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        Where `n` is the number density of gas molecules, `σ_gg` is the gas-gas kinetic collision cross-section, and the `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the target gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This refers to the average distance an electron from the beam travels before being scattered by a gas molecule. Since the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, their velocity is extremely high compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. The gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The formula is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section. Note the absence of the `√2` factor.\n\n2.  **Comparing the Mean Free Paths:**\n    To compare λ₁ and λ₂, we can take their ratio:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n3.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    There are two competing arguments presented across the various answers, but only one is physically correct for this high-energy scenario:\n\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning (Found in a Minority of Answers):** This argument claims that because an electron is charged and interacts via the long-range Coulomb force, its scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) is larger than the kinetic cross-section for two neutral molecules (`σ_gg`). This would lead to the conclusion that λ₂ < λ₁. This reasoning is only valid for low-energy electrons.\n\n    *   **Correct Reasoning (Found in a Majority of Answers):** This argument recognizes that the electrons are extremely high-energy (1000 keV). An atom or molecule is mostly empty space to such a fast-moving, penetrating particle. The probability of significant scattering is very low. Consequently, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is **much smaller** than the kinetic cross-section of a gas molecule (`σ_gg`). This means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the correct physical reasoning for high-energy electrons, the ratio is:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number much greater than 1)\n    This means λ₂ must be significantly larger than √2 * λ₁ (where √2 ≈ 1.414).\n\n    Therefore, the relationship **λ₂ >> λ₁** holds true.\n\n### Consistency Check of Provided Answers\n\nThe provided candidate answers show a strong consensus around this correct physical conclusion. Let's analyze the options:\nA) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This contradicts the finding that λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁.\nB) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This is fully consistent with the finding that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁.\nC) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect, as the physics are different.\nD) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect, as this reflects the physics of low-energy, not high-energy, electrons.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, etc.) correctly reason that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁, pointing to option B as the correct choice. They consistently identify two key factors:\n1.  The stationary nature of the target molecules for the fast electrons eliminates the √2 factor from the denominator, increasing the electron's MFP.\n2.  The small scattering cross-section of high-energy electrons further increases their MFP.\n\nThe final answers are therefore highly consistent in concluding that **λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁**.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "**Task**: Select the most consistent answer in the following answers surrounded by <<< >>>.\n\n**Question**:\nWhile designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?\n\nA) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\nC) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\nD) λ2 < λ1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The scenario involves two different mean free paths (MFP), λ1 and λ2, within the same TEM sample compartment.\n    *   The physical conditions (pressure, temperature, gas composition, and therefore number density 'n' of gas molecules) are identical for both measurements.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules*. This is the standard definition of MFP in kinetic gas theory.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*. This is the MFP for a beam of particles passing through a target gas.\n    *   The question asks to compare the values of λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** In a gas where all particles are moving randomly, we must account for their relative motion. The standard formula from kinetic theory applies:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` = the collision cross-section for one gas molecule with another. This is related to the physical size of the molecules. In a simple hard-sphere model, σ_gas-gas = πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n        *   The `√2` factor is crucial and arises from averaging over all possible relative velocities of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** In this case, we have a high-energy, directional beam of electrons traveling through a gas of comparatively stationary molecules. (The electron velocity at 1000 keV is a significant fraction of the speed of light, while the gas molecules have much lower thermal velocities). Therefore, we can use the simpler formula for a beam hitting a stationary target:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (same as before).\n        *   `σ_e-gas` = the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gas-gas` represents the effective area for a physical collision between two molecules. It's determined by their size (e.g., van der Waals radius).\n    *   `σ_e-gas` represents the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. An electron is essentially a point particle. The scattering is an electrostatic interaction with the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus.\n    *   Crucially, for a high-energy electron (1000 kV), the probability of interaction is much lower than for two bulky molecules hitting each other. The electron can pass through the atomic structure without interaction much more easily. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules.\n    *   So, we can conclude: **σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas and the Cross-Section Comparison:**\n    *   We have:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Let's look at the denominators:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gas-gas\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_e-gas\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is smaller than σ_gas-gas, and √2 is greater than 1, the entire denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n        (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) > (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator means a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **λ2 > λ1**.\n\n5.  **Perform a Quantitative Estimate:**\n    *   Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n    *   We already established that σ_gas-gas > σ_e-gas, which means the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore: λ2 / λ1 > √2\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414, we have **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  --> This means 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22. This is incorrect because our physics-based derivation shows λ2/λ1 must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1 --> This is incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 --> This means λ2/λ1 >= 1.22. This statement is consistent with our finding that λ2/λ1 > 1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation --> This is incorrect. There is a clear physical reason for the mean free paths to be different.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules among themselves (λ1). This is due to two factors: (1) the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section, and (2) the formula for gas-gas MFP includes a √2 factor in the denominator that is absent in the beam-gas formula. Both effects make λ2 larger than λ1. Our calculation shows λ2 is at least 1.414 times larger than λ1. Option C is the only one that reflects this reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment. It is determined by collisions between the gas molecules themselves. The formula for this MFP is given by kinetic theory:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules, which are all moving at thermal speeds.\n\n    *   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules. The formula for this MFP is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent here because the electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n2.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective cross-sections, σ_gg and σ_eg.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision between two neutral gas molecules. These collisions are governed by short-range intermolecular forces. For a typical small molecule like nitrogen (N2), this cross-section is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulomb force) between the electron and the atom's nucleus and electron cloud. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV is highly relativistic), the interaction time with any single gas molecule is extremely short. The electron zips past so quickly that the probability of it being significantly deflected (scattered) is low unless it passes very close to the nucleus. This results in a very small scattering cross-section. For 1000 keV electrons on a light gas molecule, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻²³ m² or even smaller.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Cross-Sections:**\n    Comparing the typical values:\n    *   σ_gg ≈ 10⁻¹⁹ m²\n    *   σ_eg ≈ 10⁻²³ m²\n\n    It is clear that the gas-gas kinetic cross-section is much larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n    **σ_gg >> σ_eg**\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now we can compare λ1 and λ2.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n    Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, and σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg, it follows that λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n\n    **λ2 >> λ1**\n\n    This conclusion makes physical sense. For a Transmission Electron Microscope to function, the electrons must be able to travel through the column with a very low probability of being scattered by residual gas. This requires the electron's mean free path (λ2) to be very long, much longer than the dimensions of the microscope column. The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1) is a different quantity and is expected to be much shorter under the same vacuum conditions.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1\n\n    Our derived relationship is λ2 >> λ1.\n    *   Option D is incorrect.\n    *   Option C is incorrect.\n    *   Option B states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). Our analysis shows the difference is many orders of magnitude, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   Option A states that λ2 is at least 1.22 times larger than λ1. Since our analysis shows λ2 is vastly larger than λ1 (e.g., thousands of times larger), this condition is comfortably met. The number 1.22 simply serves as a threshold greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion consistent with the physics of the scenario is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   **n:** The number of target particles per unit volume. In this scenario, the gas pressure and temperature are constant, so the number density 'n' of residual gas molecules is the same for both cases.\n*   **σ:** The collision cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of the target for a collision to occur. This is the key parameter that differs between the two situations.\n\n**2. Analyze λ1: Gas Molecule MFP**\n\n*   λ1 is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this case, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are moving with thermal velocities. This movement of the targets increases the probability of collision compared to a situation with stationary targets.\n*   Kinetic theory accounts for this with a factor of √2 (approximately 1.414).\n*   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   where σ_gg is the gas-kinetic cross-section (i.e., the effective area of one gas molecule for collision with another).\n\n**3. Analyze λ2: Electron MFP**\n\n*   λ2 is the mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the 1000 kV beam) colliding with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the projectile is a very fast electron (moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light), and the targets are the relatively slow-moving (quasi-stationary) gas molecules.\n*   Because the targets are effectively stationary compared to the electron's high speed, the √2 factor is not present in the formula.\n*   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   where σ_eg is the scattering cross-section of a gas molecule for a high-energy electron.\n\n**4. Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the reasoning.\n*   **σ_gg:** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the electron shells of the gas molecule. It's the cross-section for a \"hard-sphere\" like collision between two molecules.\n*   **σ_eg:** This is the scattering cross-section for a 1000 keV (1 MeV) electron. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that is highly penetrating. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. For such a high energy, the electron can often pass straight through the diffuse electron cloud of a light gas molecule (like N₂, O₂, H₂O) without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered out of the beam). The probability of a collision is much lower.\n*   Therefore, the effective area for collision as seen by the high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section between two gas molecules.\n*   Conclusion: **σ_eg < σ_gg**\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n\nNow we can find the relationship between λ2 and λ1 by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**6. Draw the Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   Since we established that σ_eg < σ_gg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than √2.\n*   **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n**7. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This contradicts λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The physics of the two collision types are different.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply the electron has a larger collision cross-section, which is physically wrong for a high-energy electron.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1. This is the only option consistent with the physical reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n### **1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\n`λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction between two electrically neutral gas molecules is governed by short-range forces (like van der Waals forces). For a \"collision\" to happen, the molecules must get very close to each other.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ1):** The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gg` (gas-gas), is related to the physical, kinetic size of the molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron MFP)**\n\n*   **Moving Particle:** An electron from the beam.\n*   **Target Particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Interaction:** The interaction is between a charged particle (the electron) and a gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons). This is a long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) interaction. The incoming electron can be deflected (scattered) by the atom's electric field even from a considerable distance, without needing to physically \"hit\" it.\n*   **Cross-Section (σ2):** The collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule, let's call it `σ_eg` (electron-gas), is determined by this long-range Coulomb interaction.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n### **4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The number density `n` of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios because the pressure and temperature inside the chamber have not changed.\n*   The crucial difference lies in the cross-sections. The effective area for a long-range Coulomb interaction (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the effective area for a short-range, kinetic-theory-based collision (`σ_gg`). An electron is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule's electric field than two gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n*   Therefore, we can conclude: `σ_eg > σ_gg`\n\n### **5. Concluding the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\nSince the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, and we have established that `σ_eg > σ_gg`:\n\n*   A larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n*   Because `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the corresponding mean free path `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n\n`λ2 < λ1`\n\nThis means an electron traveling through the residual gas in the vacuum chamber will, on average, travel a shorter distance before being scattered than a gas molecule will travel before colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Expression for λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor a gas molecule moving through other identical, moving gas molecules, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the particles.\nThe formula for λ1 is:\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Expression for λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions)**\n\nFor an electron moving through the gas, the situation is different. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them relativistic and extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Velocity of a 1000 keV electron is ~0.94c (where c is the speed of light).\n*   Thermal velocity of a gas molecule (e.g., N₂) at room temperature is ~500 m/s.\n\nSince the electrons are vastly faster, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not needed.\nThe formula for λ2 is:\nλ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n_gas` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) / (n_gas * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### **5. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nNow, we need to compare the two cross-sections. We can use a simple hard-sphere model for a first-order approximation.\n*   Let the diameter of a gas molecule be `d_gas` and its radius be `r_gas = d_gas / 2`.\n*   An electron can be considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible in this context).\n\n*   **σ_gg (Molecule-Molecule):** When two identical spheres of radius `r_gas` collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2 * r_gas = d_gas`. The effective target area is a circle of radius `d_gas`.\n    σ_gg = π * (d_gas)² = π * (2 * r_gas)² = 4π(r_gas)²\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Molecule):** When a point-like electron collides with a spherical molecule of radius `r_gas`, a collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r_gas` of the molecule's center. The effective target area is the geometric cross-section of the molecule.\n    σ_eg = π * (r_gas)²\n\n*   **Ratio of Cross-Sections:**\n    σ_gg / σ_eg = [4π(r_gas)²] / [π(r_gas)²] = 4\n\nThis simple model shows that the collision cross-section for two molecules is about 4 times larger than that for an electron and a molecule.\n\n### **6. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths**\n\nNow substitute the cross-section ratio back into our equation for the MFP ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4 = 4√2\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\nThis indicates that the mean free path for an electron is significantly *longer* than the mean free path for a gas molecule under the same conditions. This is due to two factors:\n1.  The absence of the √2 factor for electron collisions (a factor of ~1.41 increase).\n2.  The smaller collision cross-section for the electron (a factor of 4 increase in the hard-sphere model).\n\n### **7. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have concluded that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1). Let's review the given options:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\nB) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result is much larger)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct)\n\nOur calculated result, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1, satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Even if we only consider the √2 factor and assume the cross-sections are equal (which is physically an underestimate), we would get λ2 ≈ 1.41 * λ1, which also satisfies λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Therefore, option D is the only logical conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons*. It represents the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is determined by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area a target particle presents for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**: The projectile is a gas molecule, and the targets are other gas molecules. The number density of targets is `n`. The collision cross-section is for gas-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_gg`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**: The projectile is an electron, and the targets are the gas molecules. The number density of targets is the same `n`. The collision cross-section is for electron-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_eg`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    To find the relationship between λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg\n\n    This shows that the ratio of the mean free paths is inversely proportional to the ratio of their respective collision cross-sections. To know how λ2 compares to λ1, we must compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. It is also moving at extremely high, relativistic speeds (due to the 1000 kV acceleration). The gas molecules are essentially stationary targets from the electron's perspective. The effective target area (`σ_eg`) is determined by the size of the gas molecule. In a simple model, this cross-section is approximately the physical area of the molecule, σ_eg ≈ π * r², where `r` is the radius of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Here, a gas molecule is colliding with another gas molecule. Both particles have a significant size (`r`), and both are moving. The fact that the target molecules are also moving increases the likelihood of a collision compared to if they were stationary. Standard kinetic theory shows that this effect introduces a factor of √2. The cross-section is larger because it depends on the radii of *both* colliding particles. The collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2r`.\n        Therefore, the cross-section for gas-gas collisions is larger than for electron-gas collisions. A standard result from kinetic theory is:\n        σ_gg ≈ √2 * σ_eg\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now substitute the relationship between the cross-sections back into the ratio for λ:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg ≈ (√2 * σ_eg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n\n    Since √2 is approximately 1.414, we have:\n    λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    Based on our finding that λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, let's check the given choices:\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. (Correct, as 1.414 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1. (Incorrect, λ2 is larger than λ1)\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. (Incorrect, as 1.414 is not less than 1.22)\n\nThe core principle is that an electron, being much smaller and faster, can travel further on average than a gas molecule before hitting another gas molecule. Therefore, the electron's mean free path (λ2) is longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ1). Option B correctly captures this physical reality and provides a reasonable quantitative boundary.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other* before the electron beam is activated.\n*   **Moving Particle:** A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particle:** Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** This is the density of the residual gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum. Let's call it `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** This is the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. In the kinetic theory of gases, for identical molecules of diameter `d`, this is often expressed as σ_kinetic = πd². To account for the relative motion of all particles, a factor of √2 is introduced. So, the effective cross-section is σ₁ = √2 * π * d². This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud.\n\nSo, the formula for λ1 is:\n**λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁) = 1 / (n_gas * √2 * π * d²)**\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This is the mean free path of electrons from the beam scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n*   **Moving Particle:** A high-energy electron (accelerated by 1000 kV).\n*   **Target Particle:** The same residual gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The number density of the target gas molecules is unchanged, so it's the same `n_gas` as before.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule. An electron is a fundamental point-like particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the electromagnetic force (Coulomb interaction). The collision is not a \"hard-sphere\" physical contact.\n\nSo, the formula for λ2 is:\n**λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)**\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n\nThe relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relative sizes of σ₁ and σ₂.\n\n*   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. For a small molecule like nitrogen (N₂), the diameter is about 0.37 nm (3.7 Å). The cross-section is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n*   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas):** A 1000 kV electron is highly relativistic and moving at over 94% of the speed of light. At such high energies, the electron interacts very weakly with the atom's electron cloud unless it's a direct hit. The scattering cross-section for high-energy electrons on atoms is known to be **much smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section. The electron essentially \"sees\" the atom as a much smaller target than another atom does. The cross-section for this type of interaction is typically on the order of 10⁻²² m² or even smaller.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state that:\n**σ₁ >> σ₂**\n\n### **5. Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\nSince the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ` (i.e., λ = 1 / (nσ)), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path.\n\nBecause **σ₁ > σ₂**, it must be that:\n**λ1 < λ2**\n\nFurthermore, since σ₁ is several orders of magnitude larger than σ₂, λ2 will be several orders of magnitude larger than λ1.\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. It suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1, but our analysis shows it should be much larger.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as it implies the cross-sections are equal, which they are not.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states that λ2 is larger than λ1. The factor 1.22 is a very conservative lower bound; given that λ2 is likely thousands of times larger than λ1, this inequality is certainly true. It is the only option that reflects the correct physical relationship.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: This is the opposite of our conclusion.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the high-energy electron (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) represents the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision. A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In this problem, the environment (pressure, temperature, volume, and thus the number density `n` of gas molecules) is the same for both λ1 and λ2. The only difference is the nature of the colliding particles, which directly affects the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n        *   This describes a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n        *   The collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) and is often modeled as a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n        *   The collision cross-section, let's call it **σ1**, is related to the physical size (the kinetic diameter) of the gas molecules.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n        *   This describes a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule.\n        *   This collision is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule (which consists of a positive nucleus and a cloud of negative electrons) via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n        *   An electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule to be scattered or deflected. It can be influenced by the molecule's electric field from a significant distance.\n        *   This long-range interaction means the effective target area the gas molecule presents to the electron is much larger than its physical size.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section for an electron-gas interaction, let's call it **σ2**, is significantly larger than the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas interaction (σ1).\n\n3.  **Comparing the Mean Free Paths**\n    *   We have established that the collision cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger than for gas-gas scattering: **σ2 > σ1**.\n    *   The formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ). This shows an inverse relationship between λ and σ.\n    *   Since `n` is constant and σ2 > σ1, it must be true that the corresponding mean free path for the electron (λ2) is smaller than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ1).\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    An electron traveling through the residual gas is far more likely to be scattered by a gas molecule than a gas molecule is to be scattered by another gas molecule. This means the average distance an electron travels between collisions (λ2) will be shorter than the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** This is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n*   **λ1 (Gas Molecule MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Since the target molecules are also moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the denominator.\n    *   Formula: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of gas molecules, and σ_gg is the gas-gas collision cross-section (the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron MFP):** This refers to the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them extremely fast (relativistic speeds, close to the speed of light). Compared to this, the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   Formula: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the same number density of gas molecules, and σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section (the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event).\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ1 and λ2, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThis equation reveals two key differences that determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1:\n1.  **The √2 Factor:** This factor is present simply because λ1 describes collisions between moving particles of similar mass, while λ2 describes a very fast particle hitting stationary targets. This factor alone means that if the cross-sections were identical (σ_gg = σ_eg), then λ2 would be √2 times λ1 (λ2 = 1.414 * λ1).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg** is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules. It's the area presented by one molecule to another in a \"billiard ball\" type collision.\n    *   **σ_eg** is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. An electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the atom's electromagnetic field. Because an atom is mostly empty space, a high-energy electron can often pass through without a significant interaction (scattering). Therefore, the effective target area for an electron (σ_eg) is generally considered to be *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (σ_gg).\n    *   If σ_eg < σ_gg, then the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is greater than 1.\n\n### **3. Synthesize the Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two points above:\n\n*   The ratio λ2 / λ1 has a baseline factor of √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   This factor is multiplied by (σ_gg / σ_eg), which is also expected to be greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, the total ratio (λ2 / λ1) must be significantly greater than √2. A common approximation in vacuum technology textbooks suggests this ratio can be as high as 4√2 ≈ 5.66.\n\nIn any physically realistic scenario for this problem, **λ2 > √2 * λ1**, which means **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow let's look at the given choices:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer, not shorter.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1. The upper bound of 1.22*λ1 is too low.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. This ignores both the relative motion factor (√2) and the difference in collision cross-sections.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly also greater than 1.22 * λ1. This statement is a robustly true conclusion based on the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths measured under the same conditions of temperature, pressure, and volume, which means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (λ1):** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. The moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for a molecule-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ1`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam. The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules. The relevant collision cross-section is for an electron-molecule collision, which we'll call `σ2`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\n3.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths:**\n    To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (n * σ1)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    This equation shows that the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections, `σ1` and `σ2`.\n    *   If `σ2 > σ1`, then `λ2 < λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 < σ1`, then `λ2 > λ1`.\n    *   If `σ2 = σ1`, then `λ2 = λ1`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the difference between `σ1` and `σ2`.\n\n    *   **σ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This is the \"gas-kinetic\" cross-section. It describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is governed by very short-range forces (like van der Waals forces) and is closely related to the physical size of the molecules. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" collision.\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Molecule Collision Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be scattered by the electric field of the nucleus or the molecule's electron cloud. It can also lose energy and ionize or excite the molecule. Because the electromagnetic force is long-range, the electron can be significantly deflected (a \"collision\" event) even when passing the molecule at a distance much larger than its physical radius.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    The long-range electromagnetic interaction between an electron and a molecule results in a much larger effective target area than the short-range interaction between two neutral molecules. Therefore, the electron-molecule collision cross-section is significantly larger than the molecule-molecule collision cross-section.\n    σ2 > σ1\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 < 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 < λ1\n\n    The mean free path of the electrons with respect to the gas molecules is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules with respect to each other. Mike's observation of a different mean free path is physically correct, and the new mean free path `λ2` is smaller than `λ1`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect. The cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect. This also implies λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 - Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n\n(Note: The factor of 1.22 in options B and C is likely a distractor, possibly borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for resolution in optics and microscopy, and is not relevant to the comparison of these two types of mean free paths.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same gaseous environment within a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) sample chamber.\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical gas molecules. This is the standard definition of MFP in a gas.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the TEM beam) colliding with one of the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the gas molecules in this case).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n    *   The targets are other gas molecules, which are also in motion.\n    *   Because the target molecules are moving, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section (σ_gg) is related to the physical size of the molecules. If 'd' is the diameter of a gas molecule, the cross-section is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV = 1 MeV).\n    *   The targets are gas molecules.\n    *   The electron's speed is relativistic, extremely close to the speed of light (v ≈ 0.94c for a 1 MeV electron). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   The formula for λ2 does not have the √2 factor: λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 now hinges on the comparison between their respective effective cross-sections: (√2 * π * d²) for λ1 and (σ_eg) for λ2.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (for λ1):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. It's a relatively large value. For a typical gas like N₂, it's on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (for λ2):** This is determined by the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the molecule. For a very high-energy (1 MeV) electron, the interaction is very different from a simple \"physical collision\". The electron travels so fast that the time it spends near any given gas molecule is incredibly short. This leads to a very low probability of significant interaction (scattering). In high-energy physics, it's a well-established principle that scattering cross-sections decrease significantly as the energy of the incident particle increases.\n    *   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron on a gas molecule (σ_eg) is *much smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of that molecule (πd²).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   We have established that σ_eg is much smaller than πd².\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the MFP formulas:\n        *   Denominator for λ1: (√2 * n * π * d²)\n        *   Denominator for λ2: (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Since σ_eg << πd², it is certain that (n * σ_eg) << (√2 * n * π * d²).\n    *   The denominator for λ2 is much smaller than the denominator for λ1.\n    *   Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the denominator (λ = 1 / denominator), a much smaller denominator results in a much larger mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can strongly conclude that **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so it will not be bounded by a small factor like 1.22.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option that reflects the fact that λ2 is larger than λ1. The value 1.22 is a lower bound which is easily satisfied, as our physical reasoning indicates the ratio λ2/λ1 is very large. (Even a highly simplified and incorrect model assuming σ_eg = πd² would give λ2/λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies this inequality).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths (MFPs):\n\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam. This is the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\nThe general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles**: Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume. This value is constant for both scenarios since the vacuum state and temperature are fixed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd'. When two such molecules collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance 'd' of each other. The effective target area is therefore σ_gg = πd².\n*   **Formula**: For a gas of identical particles in thermal motion, the relative velocity is higher than the average velocity. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: An electron from the beam. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at near the speed of light.\n*   **Target Particles**: The stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The same 'n' as before.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule. An electron is, for scattering purposes, essentially a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). It collides with a gas molecule of diameter 'd' (and radius r = d/2). The effective target area is determined by the size of the molecule alone: σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd².\n*   **Formula**: Because the electrons are moving so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary. The √2 factor, which accounts for the relative motion of targets, is not needed.\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (1/4)πd²) = 4 / (nπd²)\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1 using the formulas derived above.\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (nπd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * πd²) ]\n\nThe terms 'n', 'π', and 'd²' cancel out:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\nThe result of our analysis is that the mean free path of an electron (λ2) is approximately 5.66 times larger than the mean free path of a gas molecule (λ1). Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result 5.66 is not in this range)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, since 5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical reason for this difference is that the collision cross-section is much smaller for a point-like electron hitting a molecule than for two molecules of significant size hitting each other. A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path. Our calculation, based on a standard hard-sphere model, shows λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. The inequality λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is therefore the correct conclusion. More advanced physics models show that for high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section is even smaller, making the ratio λ2/λ1 even larger, which further strengthens this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.

This is the **gas-kinetic cross-section**. It's determined by the physical size of the molecules. For two identical molecules of diameter `d`, the cross-section is roughly σ1 ≈ πd². This type of collision is like two billiard balls hitting each other.\n        *   Therefore, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1).\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (λ2):** This describes the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   Moving particle: Electron.\n        *   Target particles: Gas molecules.\n        *   The number density `n` of the target gas molecules is the same as in Scenario 1, since the temperature and pressure are constant.\n        *   The collision cross-section is σ2. This is the **electron scattering cross-section**.\n        *   Therefore, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   The crucial difference lies in the nature of the collision.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ1):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is very short-range, essentially a \"hard-sphere\" or physical contact collision. The effective area (σ1) is based on the physical radii of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Collision (σ2):** An electron is a charged particle. A gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the nucleus or an orbital electron to be deflected (scattered). It can be scattered by the atom's electric field from a much larger distance.\n    *   Because of this long-range interaction, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly larger than the physical target area it presents to another neutral gas molecule (σ1).\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude: **σ2 > σ1**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and we have established that σ2 > σ1, it must follow that λ2 < λ1.\n    *   A larger collision cross-section (σ2) means a higher probability of collision per unit distance, which results in a shorter average distance traveled between collisions (a smaller mean free path, λ2).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section. Mike's observation is consistent with fundamental physics.\n\nThe options are:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect.\nB) λ2 < λ1 - Correct.\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\n\nThe value `1.22` in options C and D is a distractor, likely borrowed from the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, and is not relevant to this problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its fundamental formula is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of target gas molecules is `n`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** When considering collisions between identical molecules moving with thermal velocities, the kinetic theory of gases introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` to account for the relative motion. The cross-section itself is related to the physical size of the molecules. Let's call the molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section `σ_gg` (often approximated as `πd²`, where `d` is the molecular diameter).\n*   **Formula for λ1:**\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons\n\n*   **Particles Involved:** This involves a high-energy electron from the beam colliding with stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of the target gas molecules is the same `n`, as the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_eg`). The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (1000 kV is a relativistic energy), while the gas molecules are essentially stationary in comparison. Therefore, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:**\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### 4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n\n*   **Molecule-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For a typical gas molecule like N₂, the diameter is a few Angstroms (e.g., ~3.6 x 10⁻¹⁰ m), leading to a cross-section on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n*   **Electron-Molecule Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This describes the interaction of a tiny, point-like electron with the electromagnetic field of a molecule. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is very brief as it speeds past the molecule. In high-energy physics, it's a general principle that scattering cross-sections decrease as the energy of the projectile particle increases. The gas molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the highly energetic electron. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the molecule to the fast electron is much smaller than its physical size presented to another, slower molecule.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    σ_eg << σ_gg\n\n### 5. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2)\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas. Let's look at their ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\nTherefore:\nλ2 / λ1 >> sqrt(2)\nSince `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414, we can definitively conclude that:\nλ2 / λ1 > 1.414\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's check which option matches our conclusion `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This implies λ2/λ1 is between 1 and 1.22, which contradicts our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option consistent with the conclusion that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (and specifically, greater than 1.414 * λ1).\n\nThe electrons, being very fast and small, are much less likely to collide with the residual gas molecules than the gas molecules are with each other. This results in a much longer mean free path for the electrons.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂**\n\n*   **λ₁ (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The key factors are the number density of gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (σ₁).\n*   **λ₂ (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*. The key factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ₂).\n\n### **2. The Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   For λ₁, which involves collisions between identical, moving gas molecules, a correction factor for relative motion (√2) is typically included:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n\n*   For λ₂, the projectile is a very high-speed electron (1000 kV is relativistic), and the target gas molecules are comparatively stationary. Therefore, the correction factor is not used:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nThe number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same in both scenarios because the vacuum conditions and temperature do not change.\n\n### **3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the two cross-sections:\n\n*   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section):** This is essentially a \"hard-sphere\" collision. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the electron clouds of the gas molecules. Two molecules collide when their electron clouds get close enough to repel each other. This area, σ₁, is relatively large and is related to the kinetic diameter of the molecule (σ₁ ≈ πd²).\n\n*   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is a completely different interaction. An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. A high-energy (1 MeV) electron interacts with the gas molecule via the electrostatic force (Coulomb interaction). Because of its high speed and small size, the electron can easily pass through the \"empty space\" within the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction. A \"collision\" or scattering event only occurs if it passes very close to the nucleus or one of the molecule's own electrons.\n\n**Conclusion:** The effective area that a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron (σ₂) is much, much smaller than the area it presents to another gas molecule (σ₁).\n\nTherefore: **σ₂ << σ₁**\n\n### **4. Determine the Relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths using the formulas and our conclusion about the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nSince σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, the denominator for λ₂ (n * σ₂) is much smaller than the denominator for λ₁ (√2 * n * σ₁). A smaller denominator results in a larger value.\n\nTherefore: **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\nThe electron will travel, on average, a significantly longer distance before scattering than a gas molecule will before colliding with another molecule.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's look at the options in light of our conclusion that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁.\n\n*   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. This is incorrect; the difference should be substantial.\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This states that λ₂ is larger than λ₁ by at least a factor of 1.22. Since we concluded that λ₂ >> λ₁, this statement is consistent with our physical reasoning. Even in a very conservative estimate where σ₂ was equal to σ₁, the ratio λ₂/λ₁ would be √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies the condition. Since σ₂ is actually much smaller than σ₁, the ratio will be much larger, making this statement definitively true.\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the collision physics are fundamentally different.\n*   D) λ₂ < λ₁: This is the opposite of what the physics predicts.\n\nThe only option that correctly reflects the physical reality is B. The factor 1.22 is likely included as a distractor or a very conservative lower bound, but the inequality is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents for a collision.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n    In both scenarios described, the conditions of the residual gas in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same. This means the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant. The only difference between the calculation of λ1 and λ2 is the nature of the collision, which affects the collision cross-section `σ`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering a gas molecule moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a radius `r`. A collision occurs when the center of one molecule comes within a distance of `2r` (the sum of the radii of the two identical molecules) of the center of another molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ1, is the area of a circle with radius `2r`.\n        *   σ1 = π * (2r)² = 4πr²\n        *   So, the mean free path for gas-gas collisions is: **λ1 = 1 / (n * 4πr²)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n        *   Here, we are considering an electron from the beam moving and colliding with the gas molecules.\n        *   The size of an electron is negligible compared to the size of a gas molecule. We can treat the electron as a point particle.\n        *   A collision occurs when the electron comes within a distance of `r` (the radius of the gas molecule) of the center of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the collision cross-section, σ2, is the area of a circle with radius `r`.\n        *   σ2 = π * r²\n        *   So, the mean free path for electron-gas collisions is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * πr²)**\n\n3.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * πr²)] / [1 / (n * 4πr²)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (n * 4πr²) / (n * πr²)\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4\n\n    This means **λ2 = 4 * λ1**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The mean free path for an electron scattering with gas molecules (λ2) is approximately four times longer than the mean free path for gas molecules scattering with each other (λ1). This is because the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is about four times smaller than that for two molecules hitting each other.\n\n    Let's evaluate the given options based on our result λ2 = 4 * λ1:\n    A) λ2 < λ1: False.\n    B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False.\n    C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: True, since 4 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: False, since 4 is not less than 1.22.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWe have two scenarios to compare:\n*   **λ1**: The MFP of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2**: The MFP of high-energy electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nThe number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases. The temperature is also the same, but this primarily affects the speed of the gas molecules, which we will account for. The key differences lie in the collision dynamics and the cross-sectional area of the interaction.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn a gas, all molecules are in constant, random motion. When calculating the collision frequency for a single molecule, we must consider the relative velocity with respect to other moving molecules. For a gas in thermal equilibrium (with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds), this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the MFP formula.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, the cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d` (the minimum distance between centers for a collision), so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn this case, we have a beam of very high-energy electrons (1000 kV) traveling through the gas.\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (~0.94c for 1000kV electrons). The residual gas molecules, with thermal velocities of a few hundred m/s, are essentially stationary by comparison. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not needed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The electron is considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). A collision occurs if this point particle passes within the radius (`r`) of the target molecule.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of an electron in a gas is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. In the same hard-sphere model, a point-like electron collides with a molecule of radius `r = d/2`. The cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4**.\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, we substitute the cross-sections from our hard-sphere model:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (πd² / (πd²/4))\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4√2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, based on this standard model, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\n### **5. Considering Simpler Models and Conclusion**\n\nEven if we use a highly simplified model where we ignore the difference in geometric cross-section and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, the ratio would still be:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nIn either a standard or a simplified physical model, the mean free path of the electron (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). The ratio is at least √2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as our calculated ratios of ~1.414 and ~5.66 are both greater than 1.22)\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, as our calculated ratio is greater than 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n\nThe physics robustly indicates that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. The value 1.22 in the options is a threshold that is clearly surpassed. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an ultra-high vacuum.\n    *   **Key Players:**\n        *   Residual gas molecules in the vacuum.\n        *   High-energy electrons (from a 1000 kV accelerating voltage) forming a beam.\n    *   **Two Scenarios & Mean Free Paths:**\n        *   **λ1:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   **λ2:** The mean free path of the electrons from the beam. This is determined by electrons scattering off the stationary gas molecules.\n    *   **Goal:** Compare λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` is the scattering cross-section (the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision).\n    *   A crucial detail from the kinetic theory of gases: When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule within its own gas (like for λ1), the target molecules are also moving. This constant motion increases the likelihood of collision compared to if the targets were stationary. To account for this, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n    *   Therefore, the two specific formulas we need are:\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components of the Formulas:**\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The problem states the conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) remain the same. Therefore, the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant for both calculations.\n    *   **Velocity Factor (`√2`):**\n        *   For λ1, the target gas molecules are moving with thermal velocities, similar to the probe molecule. The `√2` factor is necessary.\n        *   For λ2, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV. Their speed is extremely high (relativistic, near the speed of light). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Thus, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The `√2` factor is *not* present for λ2.\n    *   **Cross-Section (`σ`):** This is the most complex part, but we can analyze it using a simplified \"hard-sphere\" model.\n        *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Imagine two spherical gas molecules of diameter `d`. A collision occurs if their centers get closer than the distance `d`. The effective target area, or cross-section, is therefore σ_gg = π * d².\n        *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** Now imagine a point-like electron (its physical size is negligible) approaching a spherical gas molecule of radius `r = d/2`. A collision occurs if the electron passes within the radius of the molecule. The effective target area is σ_eg = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4.\n        *   **Comparing Cross-Sections:** From this model, we see that σ_eg = σ_gg / 4. The target area for an electron is four times smaller than the effective target area for another molecule.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Let's write down the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n    *   The `n` terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    *   Now substitute the relationship we found for the cross-sections (σ_eg = σ_gg / 4):\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / (σ_gg / 4)\n    *   The σ_gg terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    *   Calculate the numerical value: √2 is approximately 1.414.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n5.  **Alternative Simplified Approach:**\n    *   What if the question intends for an even simpler model where we ignore the difference in cross-section size and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg? This isolates the effect of the target motion.\n    *   In this case, the ratio would be:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg ≈ √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   So, under this simplification, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The options are:\n        A) λ2 = λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n        D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   Our first, more detailed calculation gave λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. This satisfies option D, as 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   Our second, simplified calculation gave λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1. This also satisfies option D, as 1.414 is greater than 1.22.\n    *   Both plausible physical models lead to the same conclusion. The mean free path for the electron (λ2) is larger than the mean free path for a gas molecule (λ1). The factor is at least √2, which is greater than 1.22.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The physical reasoning robustly supports the conclusion that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. Therefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1.

Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n*   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n*   The collision involves two particles of similar mass and speed (determined by temperature). Kinetic theory for a gas of identical molecules shows that the relative motion introduces a factor of `√2`.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_gg`, is determined by the size of the molecules. If we model a molecule as a hard sphere with diameter `d`, a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules approach within a distance `d`. The effective target area is thus a circle of radius `d`, so `σ_gg = π * d²`.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * π * d²)`.\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are high-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n*   The target particles are the gas molecules, with the same number density `n_gas`.\n*   The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The `√2` factor does not apply in this case.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Let's analyze the factors determining `σ_eg`:\n    *   **Size:** The electron is a point-like particle compared to the gas molecule (diameter `d`). In a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model, a collision occurs if the electron hits the molecule. The target area is a circle of radius `r = d/2`. So, `σ_eg ≈ π * r² = π * (d/2)² = π * d² / 4`.\n    *   **Energy:** The electrons are highly energetic (1 MeV). The scattering cross-section for high-energy charged particles (described by Rutherford or Mott scattering) is inversely related to the energy of the particle. A high-energy electron is very \"penetrating\" and less likely to be scattered than a slow-moving particle. This means the actual `σ_eg` is much smaller than the geometric cross-section.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)`.\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nWe need to compare `λ1` and `λ2`. Let's form the ratio `λ2 / λ1`:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]`\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\nNow, let's compare the cross-sections `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`:\n*   From the hard-sphere size argument alone: `σ_gg = π * d²` and `σ_eg = π * d² / 4`. This gives `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n*   The high energy of the electron further reduces `σ_eg`, making the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` even larger than 4.\n\nSo, `σ_gg` is significantly larger than `σ_eg`. Let's denote this as `σ_gg >> σ_eg`.\n\nPlugging this into our ratio for λ:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n\nSince `√2 ≈ 1.414` and `σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1`, it is clear that the ratio `λ2 / λ1` will be significantly greater than 1.\n\nUsing the simple hard-sphere model as a conservative estimate:\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4 = 4√2 ≈ 5.66`\n\nThis means `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. More realistic physics (considering the high energy) would yield an even larger ratio.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** Our calculation shows `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. Since 5.66 is greater than 1.22, this option is consistent with our physical analysis.\n*   **B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This option implies that `λ2` is only slightly larger than `λ1` (less than 22% larger). This contradicts our finding that `λ2` is several times larger than `λ1`.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is incorrect, as the projectile and its energy are different, leading to different cross-sections.\n*   **D) λ2 < λ1:** This would imply `σ_eg > σ_gg`, which is physically incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical principles governing particle collisions dictate that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (`λ2`) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`). Our quantitative estimate shows `λ2` is about 5 to 6 times larger than `λ1`, and possibly much more. Therefore, the only option that correctly describes this relationship is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample compartment under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **Constant:** The number density and type of residual gas molecules, and the temperature of the compartment, are constant throughout the scenario.\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of the electrons from the TEM's beam. This describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   **Question:** How does λ₂ compare to λ₁?\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that a moving particle sees for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **For λ₁ (molecule-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n        *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a molecule hitting another molecule, let's call it `σ_molecule-molecule` or `σ₁`.\n        *   So, `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`. (Note: A more precise formula includes a √2 factor, `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ₁)`, to account for the fact that the target molecules are also moving. However, this factor doesn't change the fundamental comparison).\n\n    *   **For λ₂ (electron-molecule collisions):**\n        *   The moving particles are electrons.\n        *   The target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target particles is the same `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a molecule, let's call it `σ_electron-molecule` or `σ₂`.\n        *   So, `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂):**\n    *   This is the critical part of the problem. The relationship between λ₁ and λ₂ is inversely determined by the relationship between σ₁ and σ₂.\n    *   `σ₁` (molecule-molecule): This collision is essentially a \"billiard ball\" type of interaction. It's governed by the physical size of the molecules and the short-range van der Waals forces. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must come within a distance roughly equal to the sum of their radii. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecule, approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ₂` (electron-molecule): This is not a simple physical collision. The electron is a point-like charged particle. The gas molecule, while electrically neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. This creates an electric field around the molecule. The incoming beam electron interacts with this electric field via the long-range Coulomb force. The electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes quite far from the \"physical edge\" of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the Coulomb interaction is long-range, an electron is \"aware\" of the molecule's presence from a much larger distance compared to another neutral molecule. This means the effective target area the molecule presents to an electron (`σ₂`) is significantly larger than the effective target area it presents to another molecule (`σ₁`).\n    *   Therefore, `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:**\n    *   We have the two equations:\n        *   `λ₁ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₁)`\n        *   `λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ₂)`\n    *   We have established that the number density `n_gas` is the same in both cases.\n    *   We have deduced that `σ₂ > σ₁`.\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the cross-section `σ`, a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Because `σ₂` is larger than `σ₁`, it must follow that `λ₂` is smaller than `λ₁`.\n    *   `λ₂ < λ₁`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: This matches our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics predicts a difference.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Predicts λ₂ is larger than λ₁. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** The average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ ∝ 1/(nσ).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron colliding with the gas molecules.\n    *   **Given:** The number density (n) of gas molecules and the temperature are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, both the projectile particle (a gas molecule) and the target particles (other gas molecules) are in random thermal motion.\n    *   The standard formula for the mean free path from the kinetic theory of gases, which accounts for the relative motion of all particles, is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ₁` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. The factor `√2` is crucial and arises because the target particles are also moving.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron from a 1000 kV beam. These electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, vastly greater than the thermal velocities of the residual gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electrons are so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered essentially stationary targets.\n    *   The mean free path for a fast particle moving through a field of stationary targets is given by:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n    *   Notice the absence of the `√2` factor. Here, `σ₂` is the total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n    *   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the effective physical size of the gas molecules. It's the \"kinetic diameter\" that matters for low-energy collisions governed by intermolecular forces.\n    *   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is quite different. The electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom (both the nucleus and the atomic electrons). Due to its high energy, the electron can penetrate the electron cloud easily. High-energy scattering cross-sections are generally *smaller* than the low-energy kinetic cross-sections of the molecules themselves. An electron traveling at such a high velocity is less likely to be deflected by a gas molecule than two slow-moving gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ₁ > σ₂**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n    *   Let's divide the equation for λ₂ by the equation for λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ₂)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)]\n    *   Simplifying the expression by canceling `n`:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ₁) / σ₂\n    *   λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ₁ / σ₂)\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have two factors contributing to the ratio:\n        1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** `√2` (which is approximately 1.414). This factor alone, which comes from the gas molecules being stationary targets for the electrons, makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n        2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** `(σ₁ / σ₂)`. Since we established that σ₁ > σ₂, this ratio is greater than 1.\n    *   Combining these, the total ratio λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number greater than 1).\n    *   This means that **λ₂ / λ₁ > √2 ≈ 1.414**.\n    *   Therefore, we must have λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ : This is false, because λ₂ is greater than 1.414 * λ₁.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : This is false.\n    *   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false, as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : This is true. Since our calculation shows that λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁, it is necessarily true that λ₂ is also greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. This option correctly identifies that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda-1):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases. The system is in thermal equilibrium, and all particles (the gas molecules) are of similar mass and are moving.\n*   **λ2 (Lambda-2):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. The \"collision\" event here is an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Formula for Mean Free Path (λ)**\n\nThe general concept for mean free path is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective \"area\" a target presents for a collision).\n\nHowever, a crucial refinement is needed when the target particles are also in motion, as is the case for λ1.\n\n### **3. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion, we must account for their relative velocities. The standard formula from the Boltzmann kinetic theory is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with diameter `d`, then `σ_gg = πd²`.\n*   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, which increases the probability of collision compared to a stationary target scenario.\n\n### **4. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule)**\n\nFor the electrons in the beam, the situation is different:\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic and extremely fast. Their velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. When targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is not used.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The collision is between a tiny, point-like electron and a gas molecule. The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is primarily determined by the size of the gas molecule. Using the same hard-sphere model, a point projectile hitting a sphere of radius `r = d/2` gives a cross-section of `σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4`.\n*   **High Energy Effect:** In reality, the scattering of very high-energy electrons is a quantum mechanical and relativistic process (Mott scattering). The effective cross-section for high-energy electrons (`σ_eg`) is known to be significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two neutral molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\nCombining these points, the formula for the electron's mean free path is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n### **5. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nLet's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, let's analyze the two factors in this ratio:\n1.  **The √2 factor:** This is approximately 1.414. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1. It means that even if an electron had the same collision cross-section as a gas molecule, its mean free path would be about 41% longer simply because its targets are stationary.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):**\n    *   From our simple hard-sphere model: `σ_gg = πd²` and `σ_eg = πd²/4`. This gives a ratio of `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n    *   From more advanced physics, the high energy of the electron makes its scattering cross-section `σ_eg` even smaller relative to `σ_gg`. So the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is expected to be significantly greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the total ratio is:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number greater than 1)\n\nAt a minimum, even if we incorrectly assumed `σ_gg = σ_eg`, we would have:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nThis means that λ2 must be at least 1.414 times larger than λ1.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nWe have firmly established that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Let's examine the options:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. Since λ2 is at least 1.414*λ1, it is certainly greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1)\n*   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect. This sets an upper bound that is violated by the physics)\n\nThe physical reality dictates that the electron mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the molecule-molecule mean free path (λ1). Option C is the only one consistent with this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision and thus a shorter mean free path.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: The MFP of Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   In the kinetic theory of gases, when considering the motion of all particles, the formula is slightly modified to account for the relative motion between the colliding molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is essentially determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules. For example, σ_gg ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: The MFP of Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the gas molecules can be considered almost stationary compared to the extremely high-speed electrons (accelerated at 1000 kV, their speed is close to the speed of light). Therefore, the √2 factor (which accounts for target motion) is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The crucial difference between λ₁ and λ₂ lies in their respective collision cross-sections.\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is a \"kinetic\" or \"geometric\" cross-section. It's relatively large because it's based on the physical size of the electron shells of the molecules.\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is a \"scattering\" cross-section. An electron is a fundamental point-like particle. A \"collision\" in this context is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) that significantly deflects the electron from its path. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV), the probability of such an interaction with a light gas atom (like N₂ or O₂) is very low. The electron is moving so fast that it often passes through the atomic electron cloud with negligible interaction. The effective target for the electron is much, much smaller than the physical size of the gas molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **5. Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   We have:\n    *   λ₁ ∝ 1 / (√2 * σ_gg)\n    *   λ₂ ∝ 1 / σ_eg\n*   Since `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg`.\n*   Therefore, λ₂ will be much larger than λ₁.\n    *   **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation:** Incorrect. The physics dictates they must be different.\n*   **B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁:** Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows λ₂ should be *much* larger.\n*   **C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁:** This is the only option that aligns with our conclusion that **λ₂ > λ₁**. Although the actual ratio λ₂/λ₁ is expected to be much greater than 1.22, this statement is mathematically and physically correct because it establishes the correct relationship (λ₂ is larger than λ₁) and provides a lower bound.\n*   **D) λ₂ < λ₁:** Incorrect. This would imply that an electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is contrary to the physics of high-energy scattering.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ₁).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with **other gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is a gas molecule, and the target is also a gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with **gas molecules**. Here, the moving particle is an electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Components of the MFP Formula:**\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same for both calculations. Therefore, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant in both scenarios.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** This is the key difference.\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules. This represents the effective area for two relatively large, slow-moving molecules to collide. A more precise formula for MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁), where the √2 accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** The collision cross-section, σ₂, describes the scattering of a high-energy electron by a gas molecule. An electron is a point-like particle, and it is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (accelerated by 1000 kV). It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom. The probability of such a high-energy, small projectile being significantly scattered by the sparse electric field of a single atom is much lower than the probability of two bulky gas molecules physically colliding. Therefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ₂) is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ₁).\n        *   So, we have **σ₂ << σ₁**.\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, it follows that λ₂ must be **much larger** than λ₁.\n    *   λ₂ >> λ₁\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This contradicts our conclusion.\n    *   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This statement asserts that λ₂ is at least 22% larger than λ₁. Since our physical reasoning concludes that λ₂ is *much* larger than λ₁, this inequality is definitely true.\n    *   C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests that λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows the difference should be orders of magnitude, not a mere 22%.\n    *   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. There is a fundamental physical difference between the two types of collisions, so the mean free paths are expected to be different.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path for a high-energy electron traveling through a gas (λ₂) is significantly greater than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ₁). Option B is the only one that correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual *gas molecules* in the vacuum. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The primary factors are the number density of the gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two molecules (σ_gg, the gas-kinetic cross-section).\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons* traveling through the residual gas. It represents the average distance a 1000 keV electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule. The primary factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section between an electron and a gas molecule (σ_eg).\n\n2.  **Formulate the equations for MFP:**\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a particle in a gas of similar particles is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target gas molecules are also moving, not stationary.\n\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a very fast projectile (like a high-energy electron) moving through a gas of relatively slow-moving molecules is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Here, the √2 factor is omitted because the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary compared to the relativistic speed of the 1000 keV electrons.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. It describes the effective area for a \"billiard ball\" type collision between two neutral molecules. For a typical gas like N2, this is on the order of 10⁻¹⁵ cm².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the effective area for an electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. The interaction is electromagnetic (Coulombic). The magnitude of this cross-section is highly dependent on the electron's energy.\n        *   For *low-energy* electrons (a few eV), the interaction time is long, and the cross-section can be quite large, sometimes larger than the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n        *   For *high-energy* electrons, such as the 1000 keV (1 MeV) electrons in this TEM, the situation is reversed. The electron is moving at nearly the speed of light. It passes by the gas molecules so quickly that the probability of an interaction (scattering event) is very low. Consequently, the scattering cross-section, σ_eg, for high-energy electrons is *much smaller* than the gas-kinetic cross-section, σ_gg. For 1 MeV electrons, σ_eg is typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁸ to 10⁻²⁰ cm², which is orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gg.\n\n4.  **Analyze the relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have established that for this high-energy scenario: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n    *   Let's look at the denominators of the MFP equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1: √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2: n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg (by several orders of magnitude), the denominator for λ1 is significantly larger than the denominator for λ2.\n    *   The mean free path is *inversely* proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller MFP.\n    *   Therefore, since the denominator for λ1 is much larger than for λ2, the resulting MFP λ1 must be much smaller than λ2.\n    *   Conclusion: **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect. The underlying physics is different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1, which is correct. However, it puts a very small upper bound on the ratio (λ2/λ1 < 1.22). Our analysis showed that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> This states that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least 1.22. Since our physical analysis showed that λ2 is orders of magnitude larger than λ1 (i.e., λ2 >> λ1), it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1. This statement is consistent with our conclusion.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect. This would only be true if σ_eg were significantly larger than σ_gg, which happens for low-energy electrons, not the 1000 keV electrons in a TEM.\n\nThe physical reality is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons in the residual gas is extremely long (hundreds or thousands of kilometers), which is precisely why the electron beam can travel through the microscope column without significant unwanted scattering. The mean free path of the gas molecules colliding with each other is also long due to the vacuum, but significantly shorter than that of the electrons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the two scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (determines λ1):** This involves the mean free path of gas molecules within the vacuum chamber before the electron beam is on. The particles colliding are the gas molecules themselves. They are all in random thermal motion.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (determines λ2):** This involves the mean free path of high-energy electrons from the electron beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules. Here, the projectiles are electrons, and the targets are gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general concept for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective area of the target for a collision).\n\n3.  **Calculate λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of its peers, all particles are moving. We need to consider their average *relative* velocity. This introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` into the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n    Therefore, the mean free path for the gas molecules is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n    where `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Calculate λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    When a beam of high-energy particles (electrons) is fired into a gas, the velocity of the electrons is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, meaning the electrons are highly relativistic (moving at over 90% the speed of light). In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered stationary.\n    Because the targets are stationary, the `sqrt(2)` correction factor is not used. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n6.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the effective size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular (van der Waals) forces.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. A high-energy electron (1000 keV) is a tiny, fast-moving charged particle. To it, a neutral gas molecule is mostly empty space. Significant interaction (scattering) only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the atomic electrons. This means the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the high-energy electron is very small.\n    *   Therefore, it is physically certain that the electron-gas scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion on the Ratio:**\n    Since σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1, the ratio λ2 / λ1 becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (a number much larger than 1)\n    This means λ2 / λ1 must be a value much larger than sqrt(2) (which is ≈ 1.414).\n\n    Even in the most conservative and simplified model where we might incorrectly assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, we would get:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.\n    So, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect because our analysis shows λ2 > 1.414*λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Our result, λ2 > 1.414*λ1, satisfies this condition because 1.414 is greater than 1.22. This option correctly captures that the electron's mean free path is significantly longer.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which contradicts the physics of high-energy particle interactions.\n\nThus, the electron beam travels a much longer average distance between collisions than the gas molecules do, meaning λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\nFirst, we need to clearly define the two mean free paths mentioned in the problem:\n\n*   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. This value describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas-gas collision. This is essentially the effective \"area\" that one molecule presents to another for a collision. It's related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that both the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path related to *electron scattering*. This value describes the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a *gas molecule*. The formula for this is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas collision. This is the effective \"area\" a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron for a scattering event.\n    *   Note: The `√2` factor is not present here because the gas molecules are essentially stationary compared to the extremely high-velocity electrons (accelerated by 1000 kV).\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to compare the two cross-sections: `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the physical size of the molecules' electron clouds. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. When the electron clouds of two molecules get close enough, they repel and \"collide\".\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a point-like particle, and it's moving at extremely high speed (relativistic speeds at 1000 kV). To this fast electron, an atom or molecule is mostly empty space. A scattering event only happens if the electron passes very close to the dense, positively charged nucleus or interacts with one of the orbital electrons. The probability of such a close encounter is low. Therefore, the effective target area for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is **much smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two whole molecules (`σ_gg`).\n\n    In summary: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **3. Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ)**\n\nNow we can compare λ1 and λ2 using their formulas and our understanding of the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gg.\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_eg.\n\nSince `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg` (`1/σ_gg`). This means λ2 will be much larger than λ1.\n\nLet's look at the ratio to be more precise:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nSince we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number much greater than 1.\nTherefore, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be much greater than √2 (which is approximately 1.414).\n\nOur conclusion is: **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options is consistent with our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`):\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** This statement is true. If λ2 is greater than 1.414 times λ1, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.\n*   **B) λ2 < λ1:** This is false.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is false.\n*   **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This is false. Our conclusion (`λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`) directly contradicts the upper limit in this option (`λ2 < 1.22*λ1`).\n\nTherefore, the only logically sound conclusion among the choices is A. The electron travels, on average, a much farther distance than a gas molecule before an interaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to compare two different types of mean free paths (MFP) inside a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) vacuum chamber.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This depends on the size of the gas molecules and their concentration (pressure and temperature).\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons (from the microscope's beam) colliding/scattering with the *gas molecules*. This depends on the concentration of gas molecules and the electron-molecule scattering cross-section.\n    *   The key conditions are: high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), high electron energy (1000 kV = 1 MeV), and constant temperature. The constant temperature and pressure mean the number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where *n* is the number density of target particles and *σ* is the collision cross-section.\n    *   For **λ1** (molecule-molecule collisions), the formula is more specifically λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where σ_gg is the gas kinetic cross-section (roughly πd², with *d* being the molecule's diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the gas molecules. σ_gg represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by another molecule. This is like two billiard balls colliding.\n    *   For **λ2** (electron-molecule collisions), the formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by an electron.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" type collision. The size is determined by the electron clouds of the molecules repelling each other. The cross-section is relatively large, on the order of the geometric size of the molecule (e.g., ~10⁻¹⁹ m²).\n    *   **Electron-Molecule (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a tiny, point-like particle. The \"collision\" is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) with the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. A 1000 kV electron is extremely energetic and fast-moving. An atom is mostly empty space to such a particle. The probability of a significant scattering event is much lower than for a molecule-molecule collision. Therefore, the effective target size, σ_eg, is much, much *smaller* than the gas kinetic cross-section, σ_gg.\n    *   **Conclusion:** σ_gg >> σ_eg.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 ∝ 1/σ_gg and λ2 ∝ 1/σ_eg.\n    *   Since the cross-section σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n    *   An electron can travel, on average, a much longer distance than a gas molecule before an interaction occurs. This is precisely why high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy—to make λ2 extremely long so electrons can travel unimpeded from the source to the detector.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The underlying physics and cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states λ2 > λ1, but it puts a very restrictive upper bound on λ2. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* greater than λ1, not just slightly greater. For example, the ratio λ2/λ1 can be on the order of 10³ to 10⁴. So, this statement is false because λ2 will be larger than 1.22*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons are more likely to hit gas molecules than gas molecules are to hit each other, which is physically wrong for high-energy electrons.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly captures the relationship λ2 > λ1. The factor of 1.22 simply sets a lower bound. Since our analysis concludes that λ2 is vastly larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical reality of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor, and the core of the question is the qualitative relationship between the two mean free paths.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). Therefore, λ2 >> λ1, which satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Define λ1\n\n*   **Scenario:** The system initially contains only residual gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) inside a TEM sample compartment.\n*   **λ1:** This is the mean free path (MFP) of these gas molecules colliding *with each other*.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** The standard formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical molecules is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic scattering cross-section for gas-gas collisions (related to the molecule's physical size).\n    *   The `√2` factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n*   **Magnitude of λ1:** In an ultra-high vacuum, the number density `n` is extremely low. This means that collisions between gas molecules are very rare, and consequently, λ1 is a very large distance (often hundreds of meters or even kilometers).\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Second State and Define λ2\n\n*   **Scenario:** An electron beam is initiated. The system now contains the residual gas molecules plus a beam of high-energy (1000 kV) electrons.\n*   **The \"Intriguing Observation\":** Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, which is different from λ1. The term \"intriguing\" suggests a non-obvious physical phenomenon.\n*   **Interpreting λ2:** The phrase \"mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules\" is crucial. There are two possible interpretations:\n    1.  λ2 is the MFP of the *beam electrons* as they travel through the gas.\n    2.  λ2 is the new MFP of the *gas molecules*, which are now being constantly bombarded by the electron beam.\n\n    Let's analyze which interpretation makes the observation \"intriguing.\"\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** For a TEM to work, the MFP of beam electrons must be very long to allow them to reach the sample without scattering. Discovering that the electron MFP is very long would be expected, not intriguing.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** The idea that turning on the beam profoundly changes the environment for the gas molecules themselves, altering their behavior and MFP, is a much more subtle and \"intriguing\" physical consequence. This interpretation is more likely the intended meaning.\n\n    Therefore, we will proceed with **λ2 as the mean free path of a gas molecule in the presence of the electron beam.**\n\n### 3. Analyze the New Collision Environment for a Gas Molecule\n\n*   With the beam on, a gas molecule can now collide with two types of particles:\n    1.  Other gas molecules (as before).\n    2.  Electrons from the beam.\n*   The total collision rate (ν_total) for a gas molecule is the sum of the rates of these two types of collisions:\n    ν_total = ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron\n*   The new mean free path, λ2, is the average velocity of the gas molecule divided by this new total collision rate:\n    λ₂ = v_gas / ν_total = v_gas / (ν_gas-gas + ν_gas-electron)\n*   Since the original MFP was λ₁ = v_gas / ν_gas-gas, we can see that if ν_gas-electron > 0, then ν_total > ν_gas-gas, which directly implies that **λ₂ < λ₁**.\n\n### 4. Quantify the Collision Rates to Confirm the Conclusion\n\nTo be certain, let's compare the magnitude of the two collision rates.\n*   **Gas-Gas collision rate:** ν_gas-gas = n * σ_gg * v_relative_gg ≈ n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2\n*   **Gas-Electron collision rate:** ν_gas-electron = ρ_e * σ_ge * v_relative_ge\n    *   `ρ_e` is the number density of electrons in the beam.\n    *   `σ_ge` is the cross-section for a gas molecule-electron collision.\n    *   `v_relative_ge` is the relative velocity. Since the electrons are relativistic (~0.94c) and the gas molecules are slow (thermal velocities, ~500 m/s), the relative velocity is completely dominated by the electron's velocity: `v_relative_ge ≈ v_electron`.\n\nLet's compare ν_gas-electron with ν_gas-gas.\nThe ratio is (ρ_e * σ_ge * v_electron) / (n * σ_gg * v_gas * √2).\n\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n*   **Densities (ρ_e vs. n):** Even in UHV (n ≈ 10¹³ molecules/m³), the density of electrons in a focused TEM beam is extremely high (ρ_e can be > 10¹⁸ electrons/m³). So, **ρ_e >> n**.\n*   **Velocities (v_electron vs. v_gas):** A 1 MeV electron has a velocity of ~2.8 x 10⁸ m/s, while a gas molecule has a thermal velocity of ~5 x 10² m/s. So, **v_electron >> v_gas**.\n*   **Cross-Sections (σ_ge vs. σ_gg):** The cross-section for a high-energy electron to scatter off a molecule (σ_ge) is generally *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of two molecules colliding (σ_gg), because the atom is mostly empty space to a tiny, fast electron. However, this difference is completely overwhelmed by the vast differences in density and velocity.\n\nThe product (ρ_e * v_electron) is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the product (n * v_gas). This means:\n**ν_gas-electron >> ν_gas-gas**\n\nThe total collision rate is almost entirely determined by the collisions with the beam electrons (ν_total ≈ ν_gas-electron). Since this rate is vastly higher than the original gas-gas collision rate, the mean free path of the gas molecules must be drastically reduced.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe original mean free path λ1 was very large. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules are subjected to a massive bombardment by high-density, high-velocity electrons. This introduces a new, dominant collision mechanism that dramatically increases the total collision frequency for each gas molecule. A higher collision frequency means a shorter average distance traveled between collisions.\n\nTherefore, the new mean free path, λ2, is significantly smaller than the original mean free path, λ1.\n\nλ₂ < λ₁\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem requires a comparison of two different types of mean free paths within the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each one.\n\n**1. Defining the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to an incoming projectile for a collision to occur.\n\nIn the scenario described, the sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature remain constant. This means the number density of gas molecules, `n`, is the same in both situations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n**2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   λ1 is the mean free path for a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n*   The target is a gas molecule.\n*   The relevant cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is the kinetic cross-section. This is determined by the physical size of the molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of radius `r`, the cross-section is approximately σ = π * (2r)² = 4πr². It's a measure of the geometric \"target size\".\n\nSo, **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n**3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Scattering**\n\n*   λ2 is the mean free path for a high-energy electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   The projectile is a high-energy electron.\n*   The target is a gas molecule.\n*   The relevant cross-section, let's call it `σ_e-gas`, is the scattering cross-section for an electron-atom/molecule interaction.\n\nThis interaction is fundamentally different. An electron is a charged point particle. The gas molecule consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud. The dominant interaction is the electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n\nCrucially, the Coulomb force is a long-range force. An incoming electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the gas molecule in a geometric sense to be scattered. It can be deflected by the atom's electric field even when passing at a considerable distance. Any such deflection, however small, counts as a scattering event because it removes the electron from the primary beam, affecting the quality of a high-resolution image.\n\nThis means the effective \"target area\" (`σ_e-gas`) that a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than its physical, geometric area (`σ_gas-gas`). The long reach of the Coulomb field makes the atom a much bigger target for a charged particle like an electron than for a neutral particle like another gas molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state:\n\n**σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**\n\n**4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\nSince `n` is the same for both, and `σ_e-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the expression for λ2 is larger than the denominator in the expression for λ1.\n\nA larger denominator results in a smaller value. Consequently:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mean free path of the electrons with respect to scattering by residual gas molecules (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules with respect to each other (λ1). This is because the gas molecules present a much larger effective scattering cross-section to the charged electrons than they do to each other. Mike's observation that the mean free path changed upon initiating the electron beam is correct and expected.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This type of collision is governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path of the *electrons* from the TEM's beam as they travel through the residual gas. It represents the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   A simplified general formula is: `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):**\n    *   **Particles:** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Targets:** Other gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** The number of gas molecules per unit volume. This is determined by the vacuum conditions (pressure and temperature) and is constant for both scenarios.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is the effective area that one gas molecule presents to another for a collision. For neutral molecules, this is primarily determined by their physical size (their kinetic diameter). The interaction is a short-range \"billiard ball\" type collision. Because the target molecules are also moving, the formula is refined: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Components for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):**\n    *   **Particles:** High-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n    *   **Targets:** The stationary (relative to the fast electrons) gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (n):** Same as before, as the gas conditions haven't changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event. This is fundamentally different from σ_gg. An electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron can be scattered by both the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud of the gas molecule. It doesn't need to make \"physical contact\"; it only needs to pass close enough for its trajectory to be significantly deflected.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** Represents a short-range interaction between two neutral bodies. It's related to the molecule's physical radius.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** Represents a long-range Coulomb interaction between a charge (electron) and a neutral (but polarizable) body.\n    *   The long-range nature of the Coulomb force means that an electron can be scattered from a much greater distance than the physical radius of the gas molecule. Therefore, the effective target area for an electron-gas collision is significantly **larger** than the target area for a gas-gas collision.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_eg > σ_gg**. In fact, it's typically much larger.\n\n6.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   `λ1 ≈ 1 / (n * σ_gg)` (ignoring the √2 for a direct comparison of the primary factors)\n    *   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Since the mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section `σ`, and we have established that **σ_eg > σ_gg**, it follows logically that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics of the two types of collisions are different, so their MFPs cannot be equal.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: Correct. An electron is more likely to interact with a gas molecule over a given distance than another gas molecule is. This results in a larger interaction cross-section and, consequently, a shorter mean free path for the electron.\n\nThe core principle is that the \"target\" presented by a gas molecule is much larger to an incoming charged electron than it is to another neutral gas molecule. A bigger target means more frequent collisions/scatterings, which means a shorter average distance between them.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem requires us to compare two different mean free paths (MFPs) in the same environment: λ1, the MFP of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules, and λ2, the MFP of a high-energy electron colliding with those same gas molecules.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Mean Free Path (MFP) for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For a gas molecule moving among other identical, moving molecules, the formula is:\n\nλ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. If we model the molecules as hard spheres with radius `r`, a collision occurs if their centers get within a distance of `2r`. The cross-section is therefore the area of a circle with this radius: σ_gg = π(2r)² = 4πr².\n*   The `√2` factor is included to account for the fact that both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random thermal motion.\n\nSubstituting the cross-section into the formula, we get:\n\n**λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr²)**\n\n### **2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n\nNow we consider a high-energy electron from the beam traveling through the same gas.\n\nλ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n*   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Since an electron's physical radius is negligible compared to a molecule's radius `r`, the effective target radius is just `r`. The cross-section is: σ_eg = πr².\n*   Crucially, the electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning its velocity is extremely high, approaching the speed of light. This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the \"slow-moving\" gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. When the targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is omitted from the MFP formula.\n\nSubstituting the cross-section into the formula, we get:\n\n**λ₂ = 1 / (n * πr²)**\n\n### **3. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * πr²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr²) ]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * 4πr²) / (n * πr²)\n\nBy canceling the common terms (`n`, `π`, and `r²`), we are left with:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4√2\n\nThe Python code calculated this value to be approximately 5.66.\n\nSo, **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mean free path of the electron (λ₂) is about 5.66 times *longer* than the mean free path of a gas molecule (λ₁). This is because the electron presents a much smaller cross-section for collision, and its high speed relative to the gas molecules means it \"sees\" them as stationary targets, further reducing the statistical probability of a collision over a given distance.\n\nBased on our finding that λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁, we can evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁ (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ (Correct, as 5.66 is indeed greater than 1.22)\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n*   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the electron is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n**2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2. Let's apply the formula to both.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n    *   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n    *   Let `n_gas` be the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   Let `σ_gas-gas` be the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Scattering (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n    *   The moving particles are high-energy electrons.\n    *   The target particles are the same gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of the target gas molecules, `n_gas`, remains the same because the temperature and pressure in the sample compartment have not changed.\n    *   Let `σ_electron-gas` be the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   So, **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision cross-sections, `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*. Gas molecules are electrically neutral. Collisions between them are primarily short-range interactions, similar to billiard balls colliding. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **`σ_electron-gas`**: This is the *electron scattering cross-section*. The electron is a charged particle, and the gas molecule is composed of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron from the beam interacts with the entire atom/molecule via the long-range **electromagnetic (Coulomb) force**.\n\n**4. The Critical Difference**\n\nThe Coulomb force has a much longer range than the short-range forces governing gas-molecule collisions. An incoming electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or effectively \"collided with\") by the electric field of a gas molecule even when passing at a distance much greater than the molecule's physical radius.\n\nThis means that a gas molecule presents a much larger effective target area to an incoming electron than it does to another neutral gas molecule.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n**`σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion about λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free path equations:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_gas-gas`)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * `σ_electron-gas`)\n\nSince `n_gas` is the same for both, and `σ_electron-gas` is larger than `σ_gas-gas`, the denominator in the equation for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1. A larger denominator results in a smaller value.\n\nThus, we must have:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being more likely to interact with the residual gas molecules due to its charge, will have a shorter average distance between collisions than the gas molecules will have with each other.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a scenario in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).\n    *   There are two different mean free paths being considered:\n        *   **λ1**: The mean free path of *gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard definition of mean free path in a gas.\n        *   **λ2**: The mean free path of *beam electrons colliding with gas molecules*.\n    *   The conditions are constant: ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) and the same temperature.\n    *   The question asks for the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   A general formula for MFP is:  `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target presents to the projectile for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n        *   The target is another gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is `n`.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_gg`. This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces).\n        *   So, `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)`\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):**\n        *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV).\n        *   The target is a gas molecule.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is the *same* `n` as before, because the gas conditions in the chamber haven't changed.\n        *   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule. Let's call this `σ_eg`.\n        *   So, `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   To compare λ1 and λ2, we need to compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`, since `n` is the same for both.\n    *   The relationship is inverse: if `σ` is larger, `λ` is smaller (more frequent collisions mean shorter travel distance between them).\n    *   So, the core question is: **How does the collision cross-section of a gas-gas collision (`σ_gg`) compare to that of an electron-gas collision (`σ_eg`)?**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gg` vs. `σ_eg`):**\n    *   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Gas):** This is a \"hard-sphere-like\" collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged. The collision effectively happens only when the molecules get very close to each other, on the order of their physical diameters.\n    *   **`σ_eg` (Electron-Gas):** This is a collision between a charged particle (the electron) and a neutral, but polarizable, particle (the gas molecule). The interaction is governed by the long-range Coulomb force. The electron is deflected by the electric field of the atom's nucleus (which is positive) and its surrounding electron cloud (which is negative).\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided with\") even when it is far from the gas molecule's center. This makes the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron much larger than its physical size.\n    *   Therefore, the electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   Conclusion: `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Final Derivation:**\n    *   We established `σ_eg > σ_gg`.\n    *   We have `λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)` and `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is in the denominator for `λ2`, and `σ_eg` is larger than `σ_gg`, the value of `λ2` must be smaller than `λ1`.\n    *   Thus, **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The \"1.22\" factor is a distractor, likely from the non-relativistic de Broglie wavelength formula.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Correct. This matches our physical reasoning.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. This would imply the collision cross-sections are the same, which is physically untrue for these two different types of interactions.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for electrons in the residual gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for a particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that the particle presents for a collision.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule moving through other identical gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile and the target molecules are moving. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the gas-gas kinetic collision cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a high-energy electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they have very high kinetic energy (1 MeV) and travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% of the speed of light).\n    *   Compared to these ultra-fast electrons, the gas molecules (at room temperature) are essentially stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not used.\n    *   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n**3. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare the two mean free paths, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is determined by the physical radius of the gas molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. This value is relatively constant and independent of energy in this context.\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is not a physical contact collision. It's an interaction between the electric field of the incoming electron and the electric field of the atom (its nucleus and electron cloud). The cross-section for this interaction is highly dependent on the energy of the incoming electron.\n    *   For low-energy electrons (around 100 eV), the interaction probability is high, and `σ_eg` is at its maximum.\n    *   However, the problem specifies a **1000 kV (1 MeV)** accelerating voltage. At such extremely high, relativistic energies, the electron travels past the gas molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of the electron being significantly scattered. For high-energy charged particles, the scattering cross-section generally decreases as energy increases (roughly proportional to 1/E²).\n    *   Therefore, for the 1000 keV electrons in the TEM, the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (>> 1).\n\nLet's plug this back into our ratio formula:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a large number)\nλ2 / λ1 >> √2\nλ2 >> 1.414 * λ1\n\nThis means that the mean free path of the high-energy electrons (`λ2`) is significantly **longer** than the mean free path of the gas molecules (`λ1`). The electrons travel much farther, on average, before being scattered.\n\n**6. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 -> False.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **True**. Our analysis shows that λ2 is much larger than λ1, so it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> False.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 -> False. This would only be true if the electrons had low energy.\n\nThe number 1.22 is a specific value, but the general physical principle for high-energy electrons provides a clear conclusion that only aligns with option B. Even a simplified model where one might mistakenly assume the cross-sections are equal (`σ_gg ≈ σ_eg`) would yield λ2 ≈ √2 * λ1 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, which also satisfies the condition in B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis problem requires a conceptual understanding of the mean free path and how it depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n1.  **Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are other gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of gas molecules is `n_gas`.\n    *   The collision is a physical one, governed by short-range van der Waals forces. The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules.\n    *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the moving particles are the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam.\n    *   The target particles are the same residual gas molecules as before. Therefore, their number density `n_gas` is the same as in the first scenario, since the vacuum conditions (pressure, temperature) have not changed.\n    *   The collision, however, is fundamentally different. It is an electrostatic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas atom/molecule (composed of the positive nucleus and the negative electron cloud). This is a long-range Coulomb interaction.\n    *   An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided\") even when passing at a considerable distance from the gas molecule, a distance much larger than the molecule's physical radius.\n    *   This means the effective area for an electron to interact with a gas molecule, `σ_electron-gas`, is much larger than the physical cross-section for two gas molecules to collide, `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Therefore, we have `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   The mean free path for the electrons is λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas).\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n    Since `n_gas` is the same in both equations and we have established that `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, we can compare the two expressions. Because the cross-section `σ` is in the denominator, a larger cross-section leads to a smaller mean free path.\n\n    Given `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, it must be true that:\n    1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) < 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n\n    Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability of an electron scattering off a residual gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding with each other. This is because the electron interacts via the long-range Coulomb force, giving the gas molecule a much larger effective collision cross-section from the electron's perspective. A higher collision probability (larger cross-section) means the average distance between collisions (the mean free path) is shorter. Thus, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). This is a critical reason why an ultra-high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is the standard definition of the mean free path in gas kinetics. The formula is given by:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially the effective area one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur, roughly related to its physical size (πd², where d is the molecular diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n*   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This refers to the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. The formula is given by:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" like collision. For a collision to occur, the two neutral gas molecules must get very close to each other, such that their electron clouds repel. The interaction is short-range. The cross-section is determined by the kinetic diameter of the molecules.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering (σ_eg):** This is a fundamentally different interaction. The electron is a fast-moving charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron cloud.\n    *   The electron interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force.\n    *   An electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It only needs to pass close enough for its trajectory to be significantly deflected (scattered) by the electric field of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud.\n    *   Because the Coulomb force is long-range, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to the incoming electron is much larger than its physical size. An electron passing quite far from the molecule can still be scattered.\n\n**3. Conclusion about Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n*   Since the electron-gas interaction is long-range and the gas-gas interaction is short-range, the effective cross-section for electron-gas scattering is significantly larger than the cross-section for gas-gas collision.\n    *   **σ_eg > σ_gg**\n\n*   Now, let's look at the formulas for the mean free path:\n    *   λ is inversely proportional to σ (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n    *   This means that a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path (i.e., collisions are more frequent).\n\n*   Since σ_eg > σ_gg, it follows directly that:\n    *   **λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe electron, being a charged particle, is more likely to interact with a residual gas molecule than another gas molecule is. Therefore, its average travel distance between interactions (λ2) will be shorter than the average travel distance for a gas molecule (λ1). The other options, which introduce specific numerical factors or suggest λ2 is larger, contradict this fundamental physical principle.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are comparing two mean free paths in a TEM vacuum chamber.\n    *   $\\lambda_1$: The mean free path of residual gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   $\\lambda_2$: The mean free path of high-energy electrons (from the beam) colliding with the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The conditions (temperature, pressure, gas density) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mean Free Paths ($\\lambda$):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path (MFP) is $\\lambda = 1/(n\\sigma)$, where $n$ is the number density of target particles and $\\sigma$ is the collision cross-section.\n    *   A correction factor is needed when the target particles are also in motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze $\\lambda_1$ (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   This is the standard case from the kinetic theory of gases. The particles (projectiles) and targets are from the same population of gas molecules, all moving with thermal velocities.\n    *   The formula includes a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ to account for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n    *   The collision cross-section, $\\sigma_{gg}$, is determined by the effective size of the molecules. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter $d$, two molecules collide if their centers get within distance $d$. The cross-section is the area of a circle with this radius, so $\\sigma_{gg} = \\pi d^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze $\\lambda_2$ (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the projectiles are high-energy (1000 kV) electrons, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   **Relative Velocity:** The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets. When targets are stationary, the $\\sqrt{2}$ factor is not used.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section ($\\sigma_{eg}$):** This is the critical part of the problem and involves comparing the nature of electron-molecule vs. molecule-molecule interactions.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections ($\\sigma_{eg}$ vs. $\\sigma_{gg}$):**\n    *   **Argument 1 (Simple Geometric Model):** This model is often presented in introductory texts. It treats the particles like billiard balls.\n        *   Molecule-Molecule: A molecule of radius $r$ collides with another of radius $r$. The effective collision radius is $r+r = 2r = d$. The cross-section is $\\sigma_{gg} = \\pi d^2$.\n        *   Electron-Molecule: An electron's physical size is negligible (radius $\\approx 0$). It collides with a molecule of radius $r$. The effective collision radius is $r+0 = r$. The cross-section is $\\sigma_{eg} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (d/2)^2 = (\\pi d^2)/4 = \\sigma_{gg}/4$.\n        *   *If this model were correct*, it would imply $\\sigma_{eg}$ is *smaller* than $\\sigma_{gg}$.\n\n    *   **Argument 2 (Force-Based Model):** This model considers the fundamental forces involved, which is more physically accurate.\n        *   Molecule-Molecule Interaction: Two neutral molecules interact via the very short-range van der Waals force. They must get very close to \"collide\". This results in the standard kinetic cross-section, $\\sigma_{gg}$.\n        *   Electron-Molecule Interaction: An electron is a charged particle. It interacts with a neutral gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic force. The electron's electric field polarizes the molecule (creating a temporary dipole), leading to an attractive force. This interaction can deflect the electron's path from a much greater distance than the physical \"touching\" distance required for molecule-molecule collisions.\n        *   In the context of an electron beam, especially in a high-resolution microscope, any scattering event that causes a deflection can be considered a \"collision\" as it can degrade the image. Because the electrostatic force is long-range, the effective \"target area\" for causing *some* deflection is much larger than the physical size of the molecule.\n        *   Therefore, this reasoning suggests the effective electron-gas cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section: $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sigma_{gg}$.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Compare $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$:**\n    *   We have the two formulas:\n        *   $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}$\n        *   $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_{eg}}$\n    *   Let's find the ratio:\n        *   $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1 / (n \\sigma_{eg})}{1 / (\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_{gg}}{n \\sigma_{eg}} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}}$\n    *   Using the more physically robust force-based model (Argument 2), we concluded that $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sigma_{gg}$. This means the fraction $\\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}}$ is less than 1.\n    *   For $\\lambda_2$ to be less than $\\lambda_1$, we need $\\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_{gg}}{\\sigma_{eg}} < 1$, which means $\\sigma_{eg} > \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{gg}$.\n    *   Given that the electrostatic interaction is fundamentally stronger and longer-ranged than the van der Waals interaction, it is plausible that the electron-scattering cross-section is indeed larger than the gas-kinetic cross-section by more than a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section.\n    *   The long-range electrostatic interaction between an electron and a gas molecule leads to a larger effective collision cross-section ($\\sigma_{eg}$) than the short-range interaction between two neutral gas molecules ($\\sigma_{gg}$).\n    *   A larger cross-section for the electrons leads to a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that $\\lambda_2 < \\lambda_1$. The \"intriguing observation\" by Mike is that the tiny electron has a *shorter* mean free path than the much larger gas molecules, which is counter to the simple geometric (\"billiard ball\") intuition but consistent with an understanding of the underlying forces.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   This is the standard definition of mean free path in the kinetic theory of gases. The interaction is between two relatively large, neutral particles (the gas molecules). The collisions are governed by their physical size and short-range intermolecular forces.\n    *   The formula is:  `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * π * d² * n)`\n        *   `d` = kinetic diameter of the gas molecule.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume).\n        *   The term `√2 * π * d²` represents the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   This refers to the average distance an electron from the microscope's beam travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*.\n    *   This interaction is fundamentally different. It involves a very small, point-like charged particle (the electron) interacting with the electrostatic field of a much larger, complex particle (the gas molecule, which consists of a positive nucleus and a negative electron cloud).\n    *   The formula is: `λ₂ = 1 / (σ * n)`\n        *   `σ` = total scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule interaction.\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as in the case for λ1).\n\n### **2. Compare the Nature of the Collisions (Cross-Sections)**\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 is to compare their respective collision/scattering cross-sections. The cross-section (`σ`) is essentially the \"effective target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section (`√2 * π * d²`)**: This is based on the physical size of the molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" model. For a collision to happen, the centers of the two molecules must approach each other within a distance equal to their diameter `d`.\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (`σ`)**: This is not a simple physical collision. The electron interacts with the long-range electric (Coulomb) field of the gas molecule. The electron doesn't need to physically \"hit\" the molecule's nucleus or its electrons. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) just by passing through the atom's electric field, which extends well beyond its physical radius `d`.\n\n### **3. Conclusion on Cross-Sections and Mean Free Paths**\n\n1.  Because the electron interacts via the long-range electrostatic force, the effective target area it \"sees\" (`σ`) is much larger than the physical target area seen by another gas molecule (`√2 * π * d²`).\n2.  Therefore, the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule is significantly larger than the collision cross-section for two gas molecules: `σ > √2 * π * d²`.\n3.  The mean free path is *inversely proportional* to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ). A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely to happen over a given distance, which results in a shorter average path between collisions.\n4.  Since the cross-section for electron-gas scattering is larger, the corresponding mean free path (λ2) must be **smaller** than the mean free path for gas-gas collisions (λ1).\n\nThus, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**. Mike's observation is not a discrepancy but a direct consequence of the different physics governing the two types of interactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules colliding with each other*. In this scenario, all particles (the colliding particle and the target particle) are of the same type (gas molecules) and are in thermal motion.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons colliding (scattering) with the residual gas molecules*. In this scenario, the colliding particles (electrons) are very different from the target particles (gas molecules).\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   For gas molecules colliding with each other, all particles are moving. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for the relative motion of the particles. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 into the standard formula.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule in a gas of identical molecules is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules. The `√2` (approximately 1.414) factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   The electrons are accelerated by a 1000 kV potential. This gives them extremely high kinetic energy, and their velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, far exceeding the thermal velocities of the gas molecules.\n    *   From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets.\n    *   When the colliding particle is much faster than the target particles, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a fast electron moving through a gas is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n6.  **Analyze the Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size (van der Waals diameter, `d`) of the molecules. It is typically modeled as σ_gg ≈ πd².\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. It's more complex as it involves the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and the molecule's electron cloud and nucleus. However, for a high-energy electron, the interaction is only significant for very close passes. A simple hard-sphere model would treat the electron as a point particle and the gas molecule as a sphere of radius r = d/2. In this case, the cross-section would be σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4 = σ_gg/4. Other models for high-energy scattering also suggest that σ_eg can be smaller than σ_gg.\n    *   However, for a first-order approximation, it is common to assume the cross-sections are of the same order of magnitude (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio and Conclude**\n    *   **Case 1: Assume similar cross-sections (σ_gg ≈ σ_eg)**. This is the most straightforward comparison based on the kinetic theory models.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n        λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n    *   **Case 2: Use the hard-sphere model (σ_eg ≈ σ_gg/4)**.\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / (σ_gg/4)) = 4√2\n        λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1\n\n    In either case, and in any physically realistic scenario, the removal of the `√2` from the denominator due to the high electron speed is the dominant factor. This means **λ2 is significantly greater than λ1**.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    Our primary estimate is `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1`.\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our estimate of 1.414 is not less than 1.22.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1...: Incorrect. The physics is different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Our calculated value of `λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1` satisfies this condition. The number `1.22` is simply a value that is less than the theoretical lower bound of `√2`, making this the only valid choice.\n\nThe key insight is that electrons, being much faster than gas molecules, effectively \"see\" a field of stationary targets, allowing them to travel a longer average distance between collisions compared to a gas molecule moving amongst other moving gas molecules.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths in the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each one.\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the sample compartment's vacuum state, volume, and temperature are constant (before and after the beam is on). According to the ideal gas law (P = nkT), the number density of the gas molecules (`n_gas`) remains the same in both scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections (σ).\n\n### 2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ1 represents the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The particles are of similar size and mass, and their collisions are primarily governed by their kinetic size (van der Waals radius). This can be modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or hard-sphere collision.\n*   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ1, is therefore related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter d, the cross-section is σ1 = πd².\n*   A more precise formula for MFP in a gas of identical particles includes a factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the target particles, so λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ1). However, the key component is σ1, the geometric cross-section.\n\n### 3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ2 is defined based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. Here, the moving particle is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target particles are the stationary (in comparison) gas molecules.\n*   The collision here is not a simple physical impact. It is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n*   The range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than the physical size of the molecule. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes at a distance much larger than the molecule's radius.\n*   This means the effective area for an interaction, the electron scattering cross-section (σ2), is significantly **larger** than the geometric collision cross-section of the gas molecules (σ1). The gas molecule presents a much \"bigger target\" to an incoming electron than it does to another gas molecule.\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nWe have:\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ1 (gas-gas geometric cross-section).\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ2 (electron-gas scattering cross-section).\n*   The number density `n_gas` is the same for both calculations.\n\nFrom our analysis, we concluded that the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section:\n\nσ2 > σ1\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n\nTherefore, it must be that:\n\nλ2 < λ1\n\nThe electron, experiencing a larger effective target area for each gas molecule, is much more likely to interact (scatter) and thus travels a shorter average distance between these interactions compared to a gas molecule traveling amongst its peers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path based on electron scattering (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of gas-gas collisions (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas geometric cross-section.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   'n' is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   'σ' (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    The problem describes two different mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, within the same sample compartment. Since the compartment volume, temperature, and pressure are constant (before the beam is on), the number density 'n' of the residual gas molecules is the same for both scenarios.\n\n    *   **λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction σ1.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n        (Note: For identical particles in thermal motion, a factor of √2 is often included, i.e., λ = 1/(√2*n*σ), but this detail doesn't change the final comparison.)\n        σ1 is the *gas-kinetic cross-section*, which is related to the physical size (diameter, d) of the gas molecules. The interaction is like a \"billiard ball\" collision. σ1 is approximately πd².\n\n    *   **λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the high-energy beam colliding (or more accurately, scattering) with the stationary gas molecules. Let's call the scattering cross-section for this interaction σ2.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n        σ2 is the *electron scattering cross-section*. This is not determined by the physical size in the same way. It's determined by the electromagnetic interaction between the high-energy electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 boils down to the comparison between σ1 and σ2. From the formulas above:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Kinetic):** Molecules are neutral and interact via short-range forces. The cross-section is determined by their physical size. For a typical gas like N2, the kinetic diameter is about 0.37 nm, leading to a cross-section σ1 of roughly 4 x 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron Scattering):** The electron in the TEM has a very high energy (1000 keV = 1 MeV). High-energy charged particles are extremely penetrating. They can pass very close to or even through an atom without a significant interaction (i.e., without being scattered significantly). The probability of an interaction, and thus the scattering cross-section σ2, is very small for such energetic electrons. The cross-section for scattering decreases significantly as the electron's energy increases. For a 1 MeV electron scattering off a nitrogen atom, the total cross-section (elastic + inelastic) is on the order of 10⁻²² to 10⁻²³ m².\n\n4.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    We have established that the gas-kinetic cross-section (σ1) is much larger than the high-energy electron scattering cross-section (σ2).\n    σ1 >> σ2\n    In fact, σ1 is several orders of magnitude (thousands of times) larger than σ2.\n\n    Since λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2, and σ1 / σ2 >> 1, it follows that:\n    λ2 >> λ1\n\n    This means the mean free path of the electrons in the residual gas is much, much longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is larger than λ1, but only by a small amount (less than 22%). This contradicts our finding that λ2 is *much* larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because the collision types and cross-sections are vastly different.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that the tiny, high-energy electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is physically wrong.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option states that λ2 is at least 22% larger than λ1. Since our physical analysis concluded that λ2 is thousands of times larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physics of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely arbitrary, but the inequality holds true.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is defined by the formula:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles. In this problem, the number density of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios since the temperature, pressure, and volume of the sample compartment are constant.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\nThe problem asks to compare two different mean free paths:\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nSince `n` is constant, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse of the relationship between their respective collision cross-sections (σ1 and σ2):\n\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nWe need to compare the effective collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions (σ1_effective) with the collision cross-section for electron-gas collisions (σ2_effective).\n\n*   **σ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This collision is governed by short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces). The collision occurs when two molecules get very close to each other. The effective cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. For collisions between identical moving molecules of diameter `d`, the formula for the mean free path includes a √2 factor to account for the movement of all particles:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_kinetic)\n    where σ_kinetic = πd². So, σ1_effective = √2 * πd².\n\n*   **σ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This collision involves a high-energy (1000 keV), negatively charged electron and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force between the electron and the atom's charged constituents (the positive nucleus and negative electron cloud). The question is, how does the cross-section for this interaction compare to the gas-kinetic cross-section?\n\n### 3. High-Energy Particle Behavior\n\nA common misconception is that a charged particle will always interact more strongly than a neutral one, leading to a larger cross-section. While the Coulomb force is long-range, the outcome depends critically on the projectile's energy.\n\nHigh-energy particles, such as the 1000 kV electrons in this scenario, are highly relativistic and travel at near the speed of light. They pass by the target gas molecules so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short. This short interaction time reduces the impulse transferred to the molecule (or the electron), meaning the electron must pass very close to the nucleus to be significantly deflected.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, this phenomenon is described as the scattering cross-section decreasing with increasing energy. For high energies, the atom becomes increasingly \"transparent\" to the passing electron. Search results from databases of physical data confirm this:\n*   The gas-kinetic cross-section for a typical molecule like N₂ is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n*   The total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (in the keV to MeV range) on N₂ is on the order of 10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻²² m².\n\nTherefore, the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ2) is significantly **smaller** than the effective gas-gas collision cross-section (σ1).\n\nσ2 < σ1\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), and we've established that σ2 < σ1, it follows directly that:\n\nλ2 > λ1\n\nThis conclusion eliminates option **D) λ2 < λ1**. It also makes Mike's observation \"intriguing\" because it's counter-intuitive to the naive assumption that charged particles interact more.\n\n### 5. Choosing Between Options B and C\n\nNow we must decide between:\nB) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1\n\nOur analysis showed that σ2 is not just slightly smaller, but *significantly* smaller than σ1. Let's look at the ratio more formally:\nλ2 / λ1 = σ1_effective / σ2_effective = (√2 * πd²) / σ2\n\nFrom the data found, the ratio of the cross-sections (σ1/σ2) can be 10 or even more. This means the ratio of the mean free paths (λ2/λ1) will be large (>> 1.414).\n*   Option C suggests a very tight upper bound: λ2 must be less than 1.22 * λ1. This is inconsistent with the physics of high-energy scattering, which predicts a much larger ratio.\n*   Option B provides a lower bound: λ2 is at least 1.22 * λ1. This is fully consistent with our finding that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. If λ2/λ1 is, for example, 20, then the condition λ2/λ1 >= 1.22 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the physics of the scenario strongly supports option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path of a particle is inversely proportional to its collision cross-section. For a high-energy electron (1000 keV), the scattering cross-section with a gas molecule (σ2) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section between two gas molecules (σ1). This is because the high-speed electron has a very short interaction time with the target molecule, making it effectively \"see\" a smaller target. Since σ2 < σ1, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be greater than λ1. The expected ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1, making option B the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   **λ₁:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules* colliding with each other. This is the standard definition of mean free path in kinetic theory for a single-component gas.\n    *   **λ₂:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons* from the high-energy beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a particle presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In a gas where all molecules are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. For a single species of gas molecules following a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the standard formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ_gg, for two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d` is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n        where `n` is the number density of the gas molecules and `d` is their effective diameter.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy electron (1000 kV) and the target is a gas molecule. The speed of the electron is extremely high, approaching the speed of light, while the gas molecules at room temperature have much lower thermal velocities. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 factor (which accounts for relative motion between *two sets* of moving particles) is not applicable here.\n    *   The collision involves an electron (which is, for practical purposes, a point particle in terms of size) and a gas molecule (of diameter `d`). The collision cross-section, σ_eg, is determined by the size of the gas molecule. The effective area for a collision is πr², where `r` is the radius of the molecule (`r = d/2`).\n    *   So, the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule is σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ₂ is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (πd²/4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n5.  **Compare λ₂ and λ₁:**\n    Now we establish a ratio between λ₂ and λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   We know that √2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   So, λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means **λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁**.\n\n    Let's check this result against the given options:\n    *   A) λ₂ = λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁ : Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The mean free path of the electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ₁). This is due to two factors:\n1.  **Stationary Targets:** The electrons are moving so fast that the gas molecules are effectively stationary, which removes the √2 term from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~1.41x).\n2.  **Smaller Collision Cross-Section:** The effective target area for a point-like electron hitting a molecule is smaller than for two molecules hitting each other (increasing MFP by a factor of 4 in the simple hard-sphere model).\n\nBoth effects combined lead to a much larger mean free path for the electrons. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Concept of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for MFP is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe problem presents two different scenarios for calculating the mean free path in the same sample compartment, meaning the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is the same in both cases.\n\n**Scenario 1: Molecule-Molecule Collisions (λ₁)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   **Target particles:** Other gas molecules.\n*   Since both the moving and target particles are in motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator.\n*   The collision cross-section is for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`). This is related to the physical size of the molecules (their kinetic diameter).\n*   The formula for λ₁ is: **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n**Scenario 2: Electron-Molecule Collisions (λ₂)**\n\n*   **Moving particles:** High-energy electrons from the TEM beam (1000 kV).\n*   **Target particles:** Gas molecules.\n*   Since the electrons are extremely fast compared to the relatively slow-moving gas molecules, the gas molecules can be considered stationary. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section is for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_electron-gas`).\n*   The formula for λ₂ is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **3. Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n\nSimplifying by canceling `n`:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)**\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing `σ_gas-gas` and `σ_electron-gas`.\n\n*   **σ_gas-gas:** This is the kinetic cross-section, essentially the physical \"target size\" one molecule presents to another. It's on the order of the molecule's geometric area.\n*   **σ_electron-gas:** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. The electron in the TEM has an extremely high energy (1000 keV, or 1 MeV). Such a high-energy particle is highly penetrating. It \"zips\" past the gas molecules with very little time for interaction. The probability of it being significantly deflected (a \"collision\") is very low. This means it has a very small effective collision cross-section.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule's kinetic cross-section:\n\n**σ_electron-gas << σ_gas-gas**\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nNow, let's substitute this finding back into our ratio equation:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\nSince `σ_gas-gas` is much larger than `σ_electron-gas`, the ratio `(σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)` is a large number (much greater than 1).\n\nThis means:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a large number) >> √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nSo, λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁, and the upper limit is less than the theoretical minimum ratio of √2 (which would occur if the cross-sections were equal).\n*   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: **Correct**. Since we have firmly established that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁ (λ₂ >> 1.414 * λ₁), it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ₁. This is the only statement that aligns with the physical reality.\n*   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physics of the two types of collisions are different, so the MFPs must also be different.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the rate of scattering events between electrons and gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. However, a correction factor is needed when the target particles are also in motion.\n\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** The gas molecules are all moving at thermal velocities. To account for their relative motion, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n        `λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (gas-kinetic cross-section).\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them travel at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). This velocity is orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. The `sqrt(2)` factor is not needed.\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as for λ1).\n        *   `σ_eg` = the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gg`: This is the standard gas-kinetic cross-section. It's related to the physical size of the molecules, often modeled as `πd²` where `d` is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ_eg`: This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a molecule. A high-energy (1000 keV) electron is a point-like particle with a very short de Broglie wavelength. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. At such high energies, the electron is more likely to pass through the atomic structure with only a small deflection rather than having a hard \"collision\". The quantum mechanical scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) for such high-energy particles is generally *smaller* than the simple geometric/kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Ratio λ2 / λ1:**\n    We have `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`.\n    *   `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is smaller than `σ_gg`, the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is a value greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the total ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be greater than `sqrt(2) * 1`, which means `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion:**\n    Our analysis shows that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1. Specifically, `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Now we check this against the given options:\n\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our calculated lower bound is ~1.414)\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. If `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, then it is certainly also `>= 1.22 * λ1`)\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n\n    The primary reasons for λ2 being larger than λ1 are:\n    1.  The absence of the `sqrt(2)` factor in the λ2 equation (because the electrons are much faster than the gas molecules).\n    2.  The smaller scattering cross-section of a high-energy electron compared to the kinetic cross-section of a gas molecule.\n\nBoth effects increase the mean free path for the electrons compared to that of the gas molecules. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define λ1:** The problem states that λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves before the electron beam is active. This path is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules. The mean free path (MFP) in this case is given by the formula:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section for gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Define λ2:** The problem states that λ2 is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam, which is determined by the electrons scattering off the gas molecules.\n\n3.  **Initial (Naive) Analysis:** A first-level analysis would compare a single electron projectile with a single gas molecule target.\n    *   An electron is a tiny, point-like particle.\n    *   A gas molecule (like N2 or O2) is much larger.\n    *   A high-energy (1000 kV) electron is moving extremely fast and sees the gas molecule as mostly empty space. For the electron to be scattered, it must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron.\n    *   In contrast, two gas molecules are like two large, fluffy balls that collide if their outer electron clouds touch.\n    *   This implies that the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a neutral molecule (σ_e-neutral) is much *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (σ_gg).\n    *   If this were the whole story, since MFP is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section would lead to a longer mean free path. This would mean λ2 >> λ1. However, the problem describes an \"intriguing observation,\" suggesting a more complex phenomenon is at play.\n\n4.  **The Critical Effect of the Electron Beam:** The key to solving this problem lies in understanding what happens \"upon initiating the electron beam.\" A high-energy electron beam is a powerful source of ionization. As the electrons in the beam travel through the sample chamber, they will collide with and strip electrons from the residual gas molecules, creating positive ions.\n    *   **Initial state (beam off):** The chamber contains only neutral gas molecules.\n    *   **Operating state (beam on):** The chamber contains a mixture of neutral gas molecules and positive gas ions. The electron beam is now traveling through this partially ionized gas (a plasma).\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the Cross-Sections:** We must now consider the new composition of the target gas.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ1 (molecule-molecule) remains `σ_gg`, as this is the baseline state.\n    *   The cross-section relevant for λ2 is now the *effective* cross-section for an electron scattering off the mixture of neutrals and ions.\n    *   The scattering cross-section for a charged particle (the electron) interacting with another charged particle (the gas ion) is governed by the long-range and strong Coulomb force. This electron-ion cross-section (`σ_e-ion`) is vastly *larger* than both the electron-neutral cross-section (`σ_e-neutral`) and the neutral molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n    *   Even if only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized, their enormous scattering cross-section can dominate the overall scattering process for the electron beam. The effective scattering cross-section, `σ_effective`, becomes significantly larger than `σ_gg`.\n\n6.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 is inversely proportional to the kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n    *   λ2 is inversely proportional to the effective cross-section `σ_effective`.\n    *   Since the beam's ionization effect makes `σ_effective` > `σ_gg`, the mean free path for the electrons will be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules.\n    *   A larger cross-section means collisions are more frequent, leading to a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that λ2 < λ1.\n\nThis phenomenon, where the beam itself creates ions that in turn increase the scattering rate and degrade the beam, is a well-known issue in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, often referred to as ion trapping or beam-induced pressure rise.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The ionization of residual gas by the electron beam drastically increases the scattering cross-section encountered by the electrons. This larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The fundamental formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n\n*   **λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **Particle:** A gas molecule.\n    *   **Target:** Other gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules in the chamber.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ1`):** The effective area for two gas molecules to collide. Because both molecules have a significant size, this cross-section is relatively large. From kinetic theory, for identical spheres of diameter `d`, this is `σ1 = πd²`.\n    *   The full formula from kinetic theory for a gas of identical particles is `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`. The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of all molecules (they are all moving targets).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   **Particle:** An electron.\n    *   **Target:** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules, which is the **same** as in the first case, since the vacuum state itself has not changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ2`):** The effective area a gas molecule presents for a collision with an electron.\n    *   The formula is `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`. The `√2` factor is not used here because the electrons are moving at extremely high speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the collision cross-section.\n\n*   **For `σ1` (molecule-molecule):** Imagine two billiard balls of diameter `d` colliding. For a collision to occur, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the center of the other. This gives an effective target area of `πd²`.\n*   **For `σ2` (electron-molecule):** Now imagine a point-like particle (the electron) colliding with a billiard ball of diameter `d`. The electron has a negligible physical radius compared to the molecule. For a collision to occur, the electron must hit the physical area of the molecule, which is `πr²` or `π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`.\n\nTherefore, based on this simple geometric (hard-sphere) model:\n`σ1 = πd²`\n`σ2 = (1/4)πd²`\nThis means `σ1 = 4 * σ2`, or `σ2 = σ1 / 4`.\n\nThe cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (`σ2`) is significantly smaller than the cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (`σ1`).\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths (λ2 / λ1)**\n\nNow, let's substitute the formulas and the relationship between the cross-sections:\n\n*   `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`\n*   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ1)]`\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ1) / (n * σ2)`\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ1 / σ2)`\n\nNow, using our finding that `σ1 ≈ 4 * σ2`:\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4`\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656`\n\nSo, `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the mean free path for an electron in the gas (`λ2`) is significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`), by a factor of approximately 5.66.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`: Our result `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1` fits this condition.\nB) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1`: Our result does not fit this condition.\nC) `λ2 < λ1`: This is the opposite of what we found.\nD) `λ2 = λ1`: This contradicts the fundamental physics.\n\nThe only plausible conclusion is that `λ2` is substantially larger than `λ1`. Option A correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam. It represents the average distance an electron travels before being scattered by a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision/scattering cross-section (σ). The general form is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In the case of gas molecules colliding with each other, both the projectile and the target are moving. This requires a correction factor of √2 in the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ_gg (gas-gas), is determined by the effective kinetic diameter of the neutral gas molecules. This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision model.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specifics for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is an electron accelerated to a very high energy (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively stationary gas molecule (its thermal velocity is negligible compared to the electron's speed). Because the targets are effectively stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n    *   The scattering cross-section, let's call it σ_eg (electron-gas), is fundamentally different from σ_gg. An electron is a point charge, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron doesn't need to \"physically hit\" the molecule. It can be significantly deflected (scattered) by passing through the molecule's electron cloud or near its positively charged nucleus.\n    *   This long-range interaction means the effective \"target area\" that an electron sees (σ_eg) is much larger than the physical \"hard-sphere\" size of the molecule (which determines σ_gg).\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We have established a key physical difference: The scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is much larger than the collision cross-section for two molecules hitting each other. So, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. In fact, σ_eg is significantly larger.\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the two equations:\n        *   Denominator of λ1 = √2 * n * σ_gg\n        *   Denominator of λ2 = n * σ_eg\n    *   Since σ_eg is much larger than σ_gg, it is certain that n * σ_eg is greater than √2 * n * σ_gg.\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Since the denominator of λ2 is larger than the denominator of λ1, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability of an electron interacting (scattering) with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding. This is because the electron's charge allows it to interact with the molecule over a much larger effective area (larger scattering cross-section). A higher probability of interaction means the average distance between interactions (the mean free path) will be shorter. Therefore, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) will be less than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis is an excellent question that delves into the physics of particle interactions within a vacuum, specifically comparing collisions between gas molecules and collisions between electrons and gas molecules. Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the MFP of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Mean Free Path λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n        This is the scenario *before* the electron beam is turned on. We are considering a gas molecule moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   The moving particles and target particles are identical (gas molecules).\n        *   The number density of target molecules is `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section, `σ1`, is the cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (`σ_gas-gas`). This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n        *   Because the target molecules are also moving with a similar range of thermal speeds, kinetic theory adds a factor of `sqrt(2)` to the denominator.\n        *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Mean Free Path λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n        This is the scenario *after* the electron beam is turned on. We are considering an electron from the high-energy beam colliding with a stationary gas molecule.\n        *   The moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are gas molecules.\n        *   The number density of target molecules is the same, `n_gas`.\n        *   The collision cross-section, `σ2`, is the cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (`σ_e-gas`).\n        *   In this case, the electrons are moving at a very high velocity (at 1000 kV, their speed is close to the speed of light), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can approximate the gas molecules as being stationary targets. Thus, the `sqrt(2)` factor is not used.\n        *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)**\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\n\n    This is the core of the problem. We need to compare the effective \"target area\" of a gas molecule as seen by another gas molecule versus as seen by a high-energy electron.\n\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas`**: This is essentially a \"billiard ball\" collision. One neutral molecule has to get very close to another for their electron clouds to repel and cause a collision. The cross-section is determined by the physical radius of the molecules. `σ_gas-gas ≈ π * d²`, where `d` is the molecular diameter.\n\n    *   **`σ_e-gas`**: This is an electromagnetic interaction (Coulomb scattering). The electron is a charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron from the beam can be deflected (scattered) by interacting with this electric field from a much larger distance than the physical radius of the molecule.\n    *   In the context of a TEM, any scattering event, even a very small-angle one, can be detrimental to forming a high-resolution image. Therefore, the \"effective\" cross-section includes all these long-range interactions.\n    *   Because of this long-range Coulomb interaction, the target presented to an electron is much, much larger than the physical target presented to another neutral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **`σ_e-gas` >> `σ_gas-gas`** (the electron-gas cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas cross-section).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion on λ1 vs. λ2**\n\n    Let's compare the two expressions:\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)\n\n    We know that `σ_e-gas` is significantly larger than `σ_gas-gas`. This means the denominator in the expression for λ2 (`n_gas * σ_e-gas`) is much larger than the denominator in the expression for λ1 (`√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas`).\n\n    Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the denominator, a much larger denominator results in a much smaller mean free path.\n\n    Therefore, **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n    Mike's observation is not a discrepancy but a direct consequence of the different nature of electron-gas and gas-gas interactions. The stringent vacuum requirements in electron microscopes exist precisely because electrons are so easily scattered by residual gas molecules (i.e., `λ2` is relatively short and must be maximized by reducing `n_gas` as much as possible).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule-Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ1** represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this scenario, all particles (the projectile molecule and the target molecules) are moving at similar thermal speeds.\n*   Physics accounts for the movement of *all* particles by introducing a factor of √2 in the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_gg** (gas-gas), is the \"effective target area\" for a collision between two molecules. It's related to the physical diameter (d) of the molecules, approximately σ_gg ≈ πd².\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n    **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2: Electron-Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **λ2** represents the mean free path of a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the electron is the projectile, and the gas molecules are the targets. The electron is moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), which is orders of magnitude faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n*   Because the electron's velocity (v_e) is much greater than the gas molecule's velocity (v_g), we can treat the target molecules as being stationary. This means the √2 factor is not used.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ_eg** (electron-gas), represents the effective target area for an electron to be significantly scattered by a gas molecule. High-energy electrons interact with the electromagnetic fields of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. To a tiny, fast-moving electron, an atom consists of mostly empty space. Therefore, the probability of a scattering event is relatively low, and the scattering cross-section **σ_eg** is significantly *smaller* than the physical collision cross-section **σ_gg**.\n*   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n    **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n\n### **4. Comparing λ2 and λ1**\n\nNow we can compare the two expressions by taking their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of this ratio:\n\n1.  **The Velocity Factor (√2):** This factor is approximately 1.41. It arises because the gas molecules are treated as stationary targets for the fast electron, removing the √2 term from the denominator for λ2. This factor alone makes λ2 larger than λ1 (assuming equal cross-sections).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg):** As established, the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gg) is significantly larger than the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_eg) because an atom is mostly empty space to a high-energy electron. This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe ratio of the mean free paths is the product of these two factors:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (a number ≈ 1.41) * (a number > 1)\n\nThis definitively means that **λ2 / λ1 > 1.41**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (i.e., ratio = 1). Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (i.e., 1 < ratio < 1.22). Incorrect, as the ratio must be greater than 1.41.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (i.e., ratio >= 1.22). **This is the only option consistent with our finding that the ratio is greater than 1.41.** The value 1.22 is a lower bound that is satisfied by the physics.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (i.e., ratio < 1). Incorrect.\n\nThe electron, being a small and extremely fast particle, experiences far fewer scattering events over a given distance compared to a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. Therefore, its mean free path (λ2) will be significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The system consists of randomly moving gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam*. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a *gas molecule*. The system consists of a high-velocity, directional electron beam traveling through a sparse medium of relatively stationary gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mean Free Path Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section. This represents the effective area that one particle presents to another for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**:\n        The standard kinetic theory formula for a gas is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   `n` is the density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is roughly based on the physical size of the molecules (like two billiard balls colliding).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding gas molecules.\n\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**:\n        The formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n        *   `n` is the same density of gas molecules, as they are the targets.\n        *   `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n        *   Note: The `√2` factor is absent because the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    This is the core of the problem. We need to compare `σ_gas-gas` with `σ_e-gas`.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gas-gas):** This interaction is largely a \"hard-sphere\" collision, governed by van der Waals forces. The interaction range is short, and the cross-section is related to the physical, geometric size of the molecule.\n\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_e-gas):** This interaction is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron is scattered by both the negatively charged electron cloud and the positively charged nucleus of the gas molecule. Because the Coulomb force has a very long range, an electron can be significantly deflected (which counts as a scattering event) even if it passes relatively far from the \"physical\" boundary of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective area for scattering an electron (due to the long-range Coulomb force) is much larger than the effective area for two neutral gas molecules to collide (which requires them to get very close to each other).\n    Therefore: **σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas**\n\n5.  **Final Deduction**\n    *   We have the relationships:\n        *   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gas-gas (and n).\n        *   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_e-gas (and n).\n    *   The number density `n` is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Since σ_e-gas is significantly larger than σ_gas-gas, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be significantly smaller than λ1.\n    *   If σ_e-gas > σ_gas-gas, then 1/(n * σ_e-gas) < 1/(n * σ_gas-gas).\n    *   Even accounting for the √2 factor in the λ1 equation, the much larger electrostatic cross-section for the electron ensures this inequality holds.\n    *   Therefore, we can firmly conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\nThis aligns with the practical reason for needing an ultra-high vacuum in an electron microscope: electrons are very easily scattered by residual gas molecules (large cross-section, short mean free path), which would otherwise degrade the beam and the resulting image.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a vacuum chamber with a very low density of gas molecules.\n    *   We need to compare two different \"mean free paths\" (MFP).\n    *   **λ₁:** The mean free path of a gas molecule before it collides with *another gas molecule*.\n    *   **λ₂:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the TEM beam before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*.\n    *   The conditions (temperature, T, and number density of gas molecules, n) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path:**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle traveling through a medium of target particles is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision):**\n    *   This is the standard case from gas kinetic theory. The particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the targets are also the same gas molecules.\n    *   Because both the projectile and the target are moving with thermal velocities, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the denominator to account for the relative motion.\n    *   So, the formula for λ₁ is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding. This is roughly determined by the physical size of the molecules, approximately σ_gas-gas ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to λ₂ (Electron-Gas Collision):**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a very high-energy (1000 kV) electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are moving at near the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can therefore consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets.\n    *   Because the targets are stationary, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    *   Here, `σ_electron-gas` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    To compare them, let's take the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_electron-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_electron-gas)\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_electron-gas):**\n    *   **σ_gas-gas:** This represents a \"hard-sphere\" type collision between two neutral molecules. The interaction forces (van der Waals forces) are short-range. The cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecule, typically on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **σ_electron-gas:** This describes the scattering of a very high-energy, point-like charged particle (the electron) by the electromagnetic field of an atom/molecule. The electron is accelerated to 1000 kV, making it highly relativistic and extremely fast.\n    *   A key concept in particle physics is that as a particle's energy increases, matter becomes more \"transparent\" to it. The interaction time between the fast-moving electron and the gas molecule is incredibly short. This means the probability of a scattering event (and thus the scattering cross-section, σ_electron-gas) is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section of the molecule. The electron is more likely to zip right past or through the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction than another, slower, bulkier molecule is.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas**. In fact, for 1 MeV electrons, σ_electron-gas is typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than σ_gas-gas.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the ratio: λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas)\n    *   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   Since σ_gas-gas > σ_electron-gas, the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, λ₂ / λ₁ must be greater than √2 * 1, which means:\n        **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n    *   This result shows that the mean free path of the high-energy electron is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules. The electrons travel, on average, a much farther distance before an interaction.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This inequality is satisfied by our derived result (λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁). If a number is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than or equal to 1.22. This is the only physically consistent option.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. Our result shows λ₂ is much larger than this upper bound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the particles being collided with).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Define λ1 and λ2 based on the formula:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. The incoming particle is a gas molecule, and the target particles are also gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_gas-gas`.\n        *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas).\n        *   (Note: The full formula for identical particles includes a √2 factor, λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas), to account for the relative motion of the target particles. However, for this comparison, the core relationship depends on the cross-section, so we can omit the constant factor without changing the conclusion.)\n\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam colliding with gas molecules. The incoming particle is an electron, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n        *   Let's call the collision cross-section for this interaction `σ_e-gas`.\n        *   So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states that the conditions in the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) are the same when measuring λ1 (before the beam is on) and λ2 (when the beam is on).\n    *   This means the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is the same in both scenarios.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends solely on the inverse relationship of their respective collision cross-sections (`σ_gas-gas` and `σ_e-gas`).\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 < λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` < `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 > λ1.\n        *   If `σ_e-gas` = `σ_gas-gas`, then λ2 = λ1.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (`σ_gas-gas` vs. `σ_e-gas`):**\n    *   **`σ_gas-gas` (Kinetic Cross-Section):** This describes the collision between two neutral gas molecules. This interaction is short-range, primarily occurring when the molecules get physically close enough for their electron clouds to repel each other. It's often modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or \"hard-sphere\" collision, and the cross-section is related to the physical diameter of the molecules (σ ≈ πd²).\n\n    *   **`σ_e-gas` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the interaction between a high-energy, charged particle (the electron) and a neutral gas molecule. The interaction is governed by the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule in a billiard-ball sense. It can be deflected (elastic scattering) or transfer energy to excite or ionize the molecule (inelastic scattering) from a significant distance. Because of this long-range force, the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron is much larger than its physical size.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Due to the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the probability of an electron interacting with a gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two neutral gas molecules interacting over the same distance.\n    *   This means the electron-gas collision cross-section is significantly larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section: `σ_e-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1** is the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2** is the mean free path (MFP) of beam electrons scattering off the same gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formula**\n    The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles (projectiles) are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both projectile and target populations are identical and moving according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a correction factor of `√2` is introduced to account for their relative motion.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is related to the physical size of the molecules (e.g., their van der Waals radius).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target is a relatively slow-moving (or effectively stationary) gas molecule.\n    *   Because the electrons are moving much, much faster than the gas molecules, we can consider the gas molecules as stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` correction factor for relative motion of identical particle populations does not apply.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n    *   Here, `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\n    By simplifying the expression, we get:\n    **λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_e-gas**\n\n6.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\n    *   **σ_gas**: This represents the kinetic cross-section. It's the effective area that one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur. It's related to the physical size of the electron shells.\n    *   **σ_e-gas**: This represents the scattering cross-section. A 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic. It can pass through the electron cloud of an atom without significant deflection. To be scattered, it needs to interact strongly with the nucleus or the inner-shell electrons. This means the effective target area an atom presents to a high-energy electron is generally *smaller* than the kinetic target area it presents to another, much slower molecule.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that **σ_gas > σ_e-gas**. This means the ratio `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas)` is greater than 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas / σ_e-gas).\n    *   We know that `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We also established that `(σ_gas / σ_e-gas) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   This definitively means that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect, as our analysis shows λ2 must be greater than 1.414*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since our result is that `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, it certainly satisfies the condition `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`. The number 1.22 is a lower bound that is well within the physically derived result.\n\nIn summary, the mean free path for an electron is longer for two reasons:\n1.  The electron is treated as a fast projectile hitting stationary targets, which removes the `√2` factor from the denominator (increasing MFP by ~41%).\n2.  The high-energy electron has a smaller scattering cross-section than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecules, further increasing its mean free path.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n*   **Analysis of λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment.\n    *   This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially determined by the physical size (diameter) of the molecules (`σ_gg = π * d²`, where d is the molecular diameter). It represents a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n\n*   **Analysis of λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of the electrons from the high-energy beam.\n    *   This is the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n*   **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    1.  **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged and can be approximated as a physical \"billiard ball\" collision. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecules.\n    2.  **Electron-Gas Collision (σ_eg):** This is a collision between a high-energy charged particle (the electron) and a neutral atom/molecule. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the gas molecule in a billiard-ball sense. Instead, it interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom, which consists of the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud. This is primarily a Coulombic interaction (scattering).\n    3.  **Key Difference:** The range of the Coulomb interaction is much longer than the range of the forces governing hard-sphere collisions between neutral molecules. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even when passing at a relatively large distance from the atom's nucleus. Consequently, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-sectional area it presents to another gas molecule (`σ_gg`).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (`σ_eg > σ_gg`), the denominator in the mean free path formula for electrons is larger.\n    *   `λ1 = 1 / (constant * σ_gg)`\n    *   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Since `σ_eg > σ_gg` and `n` is the same for both scenarios, it follows that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths within the same environment (the TEM sample chamber):\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. This is a standard kinetic theory of gases problem.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formulas:** The formula for mean free path depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n    *   **For gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1):** The particles are all of similar mass and are in thermal motion, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (gas-gas).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n\n    *   **For high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules (λ2):** The electrons are projectiles with a very high, uniform velocity, much greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary. The formula for the MFP simplifies to:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule (electron-gas).\n        *   Note the absence of the `√2` factor because the targets are essentially stationary relative to the projectile.\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio between λ2 and λ1:** We can find the relationship between the two MFPs by dividing the equation for λ2 by the equation for λ1:\n    (λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    The number density `n` cancels out, leaving:\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. For a collision to occur, the two molecules, which are relatively large objects, must come close enough to interact.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This describes the probability of a high-energy (1000 keV) electron scattering off a gas molecule. The electron is a point-like particle moving at nearly the speed of light. Its interaction with the gas molecule is an electromagnetic event (scattering from the nucleus or the electron cloud). For high-energy projectiles, the scattering cross-section is known to decrease significantly with increasing energy. A very fast electron has a low probability of being deflected; it can easily \"zip through\" the atomic structure. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron is much smaller than the target area it presents to another molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The gas-gas kinetic cross-section is significantly larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section. Thus, `σ_gg > σ_eg`, which means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number greater than 1.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg).\n    *   We know `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We know `(σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 must be greater than 1.414 * 1.\n    *   So, we can confidently state: **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**, or **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: This is consistent with our finding that λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1. If a value is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than 1.22. This statement must be true.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1: This is false, as it sets an upper bound of 1.22, while our calculated lower bound is ~1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n\nThe only statement that holds true based on the physics is A. The mean free path of an electron in the gas is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. In this scenario, all particles (the gas molecules) are in random thermal motion. The standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases for this case is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial. It arises from averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for *all* colliding particles, accounting for their relative motion.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of an Electron**\n    This refers to the average distance an electron from the TEM beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule. In this scenario, we have a very high-speed projectile (the electron) moving through a collection of comparatively slow-moving targets (the gas molecules).\n    *   The electron is accelerated by 1000 kV, giving it extremely high velocity (a significant fraction of the speed of light).\n    *   The gas molecules have only their normal thermal velocities, which are orders of magnitude smaller.\n    *   Because the electron is so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered **stationary targets**.\n\n    When the targets are stationary, the formula for the mean free path simplifies, and the `√2` factor is not present:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n### **2. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ2 and λ1, let's take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n### **3. Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nNow we need to consider the relationship between the molecule-molecule cross-section (σ_gg) and the electron-molecule cross-section (σ_eg).\n\n*   **Simplifying Assumption:** In many physics problems of this type, the primary concept being tested is the difference in the physics of motion (the `√2` factor). If we make the simplifying assumption that the effective cross-sections are approximately equal (i.e., σ_gg ≈ σ_eg), then the equation becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n    Since √2 ≈ 1.414, this means λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n*   **Geometric Model:** We can also use a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model.\n    *   **σ_gg:** For two molecules of diameter `d` to collide, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the other. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `d`, so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n    *   **σ_eg:** For a point-like electron to collide with a molecule of diameter `d` (radius `r = d/2`), it must hit the geometric profile of the molecule. The cross-sectional area is a circle of radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²**.\n    *   Therefore, in this model, σ_gg = 4 * σ_eg.\n    *   Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg) = √2 * (4 * σ_eg / σ_eg) = 4√2\n    *   In this case, λ2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 * λ1 = 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### **4. Draw a Conclusion**\n\nBoth analyses, despite their different assumptions about the cross-section, lead to the same conclusion: **λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.**\n\n*   The first analysis gives λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n*   The second analysis gives λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA) λ2 < λ1  (False)\nB) λ2 = λ1  (False)\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (False, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than 1.22)\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (True, as both 1.414 and 5.66 are greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nThe fundamental physical difference is that the fast electron travels through a gas of effectively stationary targets, which reduces its collision frequency compared to a gas molecule moving among its peers. This leads to a longer mean free path. Both simple models show that λ2 is at least √2 times λ1. The value 1.22 is chosen to be a threshold that is clearly smaller than √2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at a high voltage (1000 kV) under ultra-high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr).\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** The mean free path of the *remaining gas molecules colliding with each other*. This is the standard gas kinetic definition of the mean free path. This happens *before* the electron beam is active.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** The mean free path related to the *electron beam scattering off the gas molecules*. This is the average distance an electron travels before it interacts with a gas molecule. This is observed *after* the electron beam is turned on.\n    *   **Constant Condition:** The temperature and, by extension, the number density (`n`) of the gas molecules in the chamber remain the same.\n    *   **Question:** What is the relationship between λ2 and λ1?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section, which is the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle for a \"collision\" to occur.\n\n3.  **Calculate/Define λ1:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a gas molecule moving through other gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are also gas molecules. Since both are moving, we must account for their relative velocities. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. This is basically a \"hard sphere\" collision, determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter, `d`) of the molecules. We can approximate σ_gg ≈ πd².\n\n4.  **Calculate/Define λ2:**\n    *   This is the MFP for a high-energy electron moving through the gas molecules.\n    *   The incoming particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The gas molecules, at room temperature, are moving extremely slowly in comparison. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   So, the formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   This is the crucial step. The relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the relationship between their respective denominators, specifically `√2 * σ_gg` versus `σ_eg`.\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule Interaction (for σ_gg):** Neutral gas molecules interact via very short-range forces (van der Waals forces). The collision is like two billiard balls hitting. The cross-section `σ_gg` is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n    *   **Electron-Molecule Interaction (for σ_eg):** An electron is a charged particle. It interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. The electron is repelled by the molecule's electron cloud and attracted by its atomic nuclei. Because this force has a much longer range than the van der Waals force, an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\") even when it passes quite far from the molecule's physical boundary.\n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The effective target area that a molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-section it presents to another molecule (`σ_gg`). Therefore, **σ_eg > σ_gg**. It is also much larger than `√2 * σ_gg` (since √2 is only ~1.414).\n\n6.  **Final Comparison of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (n * √2 * σ_gg)\n        *   λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   We established that the denominator for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1, because σ_eg > √2 * σ_gg.\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to its denominator, a larger denominator results in a smaller mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we must conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor related to the Rayleigh criterion for optical resolution, which is not relevant here.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This matches our physical reasoning. The mean free path for an electron scattering in a gas is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules scattering amongst themselves because the electron-gas interaction cross-section is much larger.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The two physical processes (molecule-molecule collision vs. electron-molecule scattering) are fundamentally different, so there is no reason to expect their mean free paths to be equal.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula depends on the number density (`n`) of target particles and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nThis formula is for a beam of particles moving through stationary targets. Adjustments are needed if the target particles are also moving.\n\n### **2. Calculating λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles:** The moving particles are gas molecules, and the targets are other identical gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume, which we can call `n_gas`. This is determined by the pressure and temperature in the chamber and is the same for both scenarios.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₁`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. In a simplified hard-sphere model, we consider molecules with diameter `d`. A collision occurs if the center of one molecule comes within a distance `d` of the center of another. The collision cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d`.\n    *   `σ₁ = σ_gas-gas = πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: In a gas, all molecules are in random thermal motion at comparable speeds. This fact introduces a correction factor of `√2` to account for the movement of both the projectile and target particles.\n*   **Formula for λ₁**:\n    *   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n\n### **3. Calculating λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n\n*   **Particles**: The moving particles are high-energy electrons from the TEM beam, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (`n`)**: The target density is the same as before, `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ₂`)**: This is the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule.\n    *   An electron is a point particle compared to a gas molecule. A collision occurs if the electron's path comes within a distance `r` (the molecule's radius) of the molecule's center. Since `r = d/2`, the cross-section is:\n    *   `σ₂ = σ_electron-gas = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`\n*   **Relative Motion**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at relativistic speeds (over 90% the speed of light). The thermal velocity of gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary targets. The `√2` correction factor is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ₂**:\n    *   λ₂ = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) = 1 / (n_gas * (1/4)πd²)\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow, let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / ((1/4) * n_gas * πd²) = 4 / (n_gas * πd²)\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 4 / (n_gas * πd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²) ]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = 4 * √2\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n√2 ≈ 1.414\nλ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis shows that `λ₂` is significantly larger than `λ₁`. The reasons are twofold:\n1.  The collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (`σ₂`) is about 4 times smaller than for two gas molecules hitting each other (`σ₁`).\n2.  The lack of a `√2` correction factor for `λ₂` further increases its value relative to `λ₁`.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our result `λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁`:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> **Incorrect**.\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> **Incorrect**, as 5.66 is much larger than 1.22.\nC) λ2 < λ1 -> **Incorrect**.\nD) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **Correct**. Our calculated value of 5.66 * λ₁ is clearly greater than 1.22 * λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
