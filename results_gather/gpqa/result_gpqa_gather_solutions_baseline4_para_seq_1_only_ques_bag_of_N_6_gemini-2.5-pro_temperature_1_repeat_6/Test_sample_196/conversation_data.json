The broadness (bs) and integration (1H) confirm the presence of a -COOH group.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded, meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-withdrawing group, which is the -COOH group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are less deshielded, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives the fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group from the fragment above. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the -CH₃ group and a methine (-CH-) group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a -CH- group). This gives the fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group. It is attached to the benzene ring, the -CH₂- group, and the other -CH₃ group, hence the complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Combining the fragments, we get a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Based on the analysis, Compound X has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n        *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

It is known for its ability to reduce a wide range of functional groups to simple alkanes. Most notably, it can reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying the Reaction:**\n        *   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).

The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the adjacent protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH₂- group is adjacent to that -CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-). This proton is likely attached to the benzene ring and is coupled to several other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   We have a methine group (`-CH-`) with a methyl group attached (`-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        *   The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is deshielded, suggesting it's directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   Let's connect the fragments to this methine carbon: it's bonded to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), and the ethyl group.\n        *   The full alkyl group is therefore: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X).\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ formed.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will be converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product from the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   A very broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is a classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The 'bs' (broad singlet) nature also supports this assignment.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to determine the structure of the second substituent on the ring using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This is the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm) and likely a methine group (-CH-), causing it to be a multiplet.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine group (-CH-). It is attached directly to the aromatic ring (explaining its downfield shift compared to other alkyl protons) and is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (1.4 ppm) and methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting these pieces together -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃) gives a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Structure of Compound X**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure is a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group, respectively. This corresponds to option D, but the question asks for the product of the subsequent reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Reaction and Final Product**\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃.

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n*   Now let's determine the structure of the other substituent using the remaining signals: **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H represents a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂C**H₃**).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-C**H₂**-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and a methine group (1H).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H represents another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H is the methine group (-C**H**-). Its downfield shift to 2.9 ppm indicates it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H) and methylene group (2H).\n\nAssembling this alkyl group: The benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This entire group is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Compound X.**\nBased on the analysis, Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the 4-position. Its name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent combination. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group) remains unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, which is an isomer of the sec-butyl group.

This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is expected for protons ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the second substituent on the benzene ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this CH₂ is adjacent to a CH₃. It's a multiplet because it is also coupled to another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H. Its chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be the methine group (-CH-) that is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's put the pieces together.

We also have a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group (from the 1.4 ppm and 2.9 ppm signals). The benzylic -CH group is attached to both the methyl group and the ethyl group.

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Structure Determination:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine (-CH-) group. It is shifted downfield because it is in a benzylic position (directly attached to the benzene ring). It appears as a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group. The alkyl group consists of a methine proton attached to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This arrangement forms a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acid functional groups (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group, while the rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group) will remain unchanged.\n        *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The predicted product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   This matches option (C).\n\n    A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\n    B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure and the carboxylic acid is not reduced.\n    C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. The carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n    D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, being a broad singlet and very far downfield, is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**).

This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating or weakly deactivating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. It is also coupled to another proton, making it a multiplet. This confirms a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine group (-CH-).

One of its key reactions is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying the reaction:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃.

This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Putting the pieces together so far:** We have a para-substituted benzoic acid, with an unknown alkyl group at position 4: `R-C₆H₄-COOH`. Now let's determine the structure of the R group from the remaining signals.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group from our first fragment. Its signal is a multiplet because it is split by both the adjacent -CH₃ group (from 0.9 ppm) and the -CH- group it must be attached to.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group from our second fragment. This proton is benzylic (attached to the aromatic ring) and is split by the adjacent -CH₂- group and the adjacent -CH₃ group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group (R):** By connecting the fragments, we get: Ring-**CH**(**CH₃**)-**CH₂**-**CH₃**. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to the structure in option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, all the way down to the corresponding alkane (a methylene or methyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** `R-COOH + HI/P(red) → R-CH₃`\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is converted to -CH₃. Therefore, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is also named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This is still a carboxylic acid; the reduction has not occurred.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This matches our predicted product structure and name.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are in the region for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring (like benzene).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O at ~1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates that Compound X is a carboxylic acid. The signals at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest it's an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and described as a broad singlet (bs) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d) and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons on the ring to have different chemical shifts. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other, electron-donating, substituent.\n    *   Now, let's decipher the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This is likely the -CH₂- group from the fragment above. Its multiplicity ('m') is due to splitting by both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-). Fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its downfield shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (attached to the aromatic ring). This must be the -CH- that is splitting the methyl group at 1.4 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a -CH- group attached to the benzene ring. This -CH- is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The full structure of this alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is option (C).\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. It is one of the few reagents capable of reducing a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the ring to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Product:** The product will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a *sec*-butyl group.

Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1. Analysis of the starting material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that has formed hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl chain using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This indicates a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This indicates a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine proton (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), and it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is the link between the ring, the methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and the ethyl group's methylene at 1.7 ppm. This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on the analysis, Compound X has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para positions of a benzene ring. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.

Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the final product of a reaction. To do this, we must first identify the starting material, Compound X, using the given Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra, and then determine how it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze the signals one by one to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton, located far downfield.

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group), which deshields them. The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-donating group (the alkyl substituent).\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Substituent (total C4H9):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the methine (-CH-) group (1 proton).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the -CH₂- group (2 protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group on one side.\n    *   The other substituent is an alkyl group assembled from the fragments: `Ar-CH-` + `-CH₂-CH₃` + `-CH₃`.\n    *   Connecting them logically based on the splitting patterns gives: `Ar-CH(-CH₃)(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   This group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   Therefore, the full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**4. The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X) and Red Phosphorus + HI.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl functional groups, including those in carboxylic acids, to alkanes (CH₂ or CH₃).\n\n**5. Predicting the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).

This A2B2 splitting pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for a -CH₂- group.

This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (The substituent at the para-position):**\n        *   We have four signals left for this group: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methine group (the -CH- at 2.9 ppm). This forms a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is the methylene (-CH₂-) group. It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm (which makes the methyl group a triplet) and the methine group at 2.9 ppm. This forms a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **Putting it all together:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This complete structure is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**2.

It is known to completely reduce carbonyl groups, including those in carboxylic acids, down to methylene (-CH₂-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups. It is a more potent version of the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH group is replaced by a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product Name: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**3.

This confirms the IR analysis.\n\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.

Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH2- is next to a -CH3 group. The multiplicity suggests it's also adjacent to another group, likely the methine.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine proton (-CH-). Its downfield shift (2.9 ppm) suggests it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). Based on the doublet at 1.4 ppm, this -CH- is adjacent to a -CH3 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have a benzylic CH (methine) from the 2.9 ppm signal.\n        *   Attached to this CH is a CH3 group (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n        *   Also attached to this CH must be an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).

The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, causing the adjacent protons to have different chemical shifts. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is for the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH₂- group is adjacent to that -CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton suggests a methine group (-CH-). This proton is likely attached to the benzene ring and is coupled to several other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   We have a methine group (`-CH-`) with a methyl group attached (`-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        *   The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is deshielded, suggesting it's directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   Let's connect the fragments to this methine carbon: it's bonded to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), and the ethyl group.\n        *   The full alkyl group is therefore: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position.\n    *   The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X).\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ formed.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will be converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product from the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect.

It is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure; the reactant is not reduced.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the IR spectrum of Compound X.**\n*   The broad absorption peak in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Compound X.**\nLet's break down each signal to determine the structure:\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) appearing far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n*   Now let's determine the structure of the other substituent using the remaining signals: **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H represents a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂C**H₃**).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-C**H₂**-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and a methine group (1H).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H represents another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H is the methine group (-C**H**-). Its downfield shift to 2.9 ppm indicates it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H) and methylene group (2H).\n\nAssembling this alkyl group: The benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This entire group is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Compound X.**\nBased on the analysis, Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the 4-position. Its name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent combination. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group) remains unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, which is an isomer of the sec-butyl group.

This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is expected for protons ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the second substituent on the benzene ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this CH₂ is adjacent to a CH₃. It's a multiplet because it is also coupled to another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H. Its chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be the methine group (-CH-) that is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's put the pieces together.

We also have a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group (from the 1.4 ppm and 2.9 ppm signals). The benzylic -CH group is attached to both the methyl group and the ethyl group.

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Structure Determination:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine (-CH-) group. It is shifted downfield because it is in a benzylic position (directly attached to the benzene ring). It appears as a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group. The alkyl group consists of a methine proton attached to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This arrangement forms a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acid functional groups (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group, while the rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group) will remain unchanged.\n        *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The predicted product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   This matches option (C).\n\n    A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\n    B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure and the carboxylic acid is not reduced.\n    C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. The carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n    D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, being a broad singlet and very far downfield, is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**).

This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating or weakly deactivating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. It is also coupled to another proton, making it a multiplet. This confirms a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine group (-CH-).

One of its key reactions is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Applying the reaction:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃.

This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Putting the pieces together so far:** We have a para-substituted benzoic acid, with an unknown alkyl group at position 4: `R-C₆H₄-COOH`. Now let's determine the structure of the R group from the remaining signals.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group from our first fragment. Its signal is a multiplet because it is split by both the adjacent -CH₃ group (from 0.9 ppm) and the -CH- group it must be attached to.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group from our second fragment. This proton is benzylic (attached to the aromatic ring) and is split by the adjacent -CH₂- group and the adjacent -CH₃ group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group (R):** By connecting the fragments, we get: Ring-**CH**(**CH₃**)-**CH₂**-**CH₃**. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to the structure in option (D).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, all the way down to the corresponding alkane (a methylene or methyl group).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** `R-COOH + HI/P(red) → R-CH₃`\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is converted to -CH₃. Therefore, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is also named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This is still a carboxylic acid; the reduction has not occurred.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This matches our predicted product structure and name.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X, not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are in the region for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring (like benzene).\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O at ~1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates that Compound X is a carboxylic acid. The signals at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest it's an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A signal this far downfield and described as a broad singlet (bs) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d) and each integrates to 2 protons. This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the two sets of protons on the ring to have different chemical shifts. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other, electron-donating, substituent.\n    *   Now, let's decipher the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This is likely the -CH₂- group from the fragment above. Its multiplicity ('m') is due to splitting by both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-). Fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. Its downfield shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (attached to the aromatic ring). This must be the -CH- that is splitting the methyl group at 1.4 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a -CH- group attached to the benzene ring. This -CH- is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The full structure of this alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is option (C).\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. It is one of the few reagents capable of reducing a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the ring to a methyl group (-CH₃). The *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Product:** The product will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a *sec*-butyl group.

Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1. Analysis of the starting material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that has formed hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl chain using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This indicates a -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl) fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This indicates a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine proton (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), and it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is the link between the ring, the methyl group at 1.4 ppm, and the ethyl group's methylene at 1.7 ppm. This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Based on the analysis, Compound X has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at the para positions of a benzene ring. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.

Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the final product of a reaction. To do this, we must first identify the starting material, Compound X, using the given Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra, and then determine how it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad peak):** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze the signals one by one to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton, located far downfield.

This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group), which deshields them. The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to an electron-donating group (the alkyl substituent).\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Substituent (total C4H9):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: **-CH₂-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the methine (-CH-) group (1 proton).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring). It is a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ group (3 protons) and the -CH₂- group (2 protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group on one side.\n    *   The other substituent is an alkyl group assembled from the fragments: `Ar-CH-` + `-CH₂-CH₃` + `-CH₃`.\n    *   Connecting them logically based on the splitting patterns gives: `Ar-CH(-CH₃)(-CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   This group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   Therefore, the full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**4. The Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X) and Red Phosphorus + HI.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl functional groups, including those in carboxylic acids, to alkanes (CH₂ or CH₃).\n\n**5. Predicting the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).

This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are in the aromatic region. This A2B2 splitting pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for a -CH₂- group. Combining with the triplet, this suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃). This CH₂ group is coupled to the CH₃ (3H) and another proton (1H), hence it appears as a multiplet.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a -CH- group. The chemical shift of ~2.9 ppm suggests it is a benzylic proton (i.e., attached directly to the benzene ring). This methine proton is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (3H) and the -CH₂- (2H) group. This complex coupling (5 neighboring protons) explains why it appears as a multiplet.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting these pieces gives `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkanes (i.e., -COOH is reduced to -CH₃).\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group.

Deconstruct the Input Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The sharp, strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (The substituent at the para-position):**\n        *   We have four signals left for this group: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methine group (the -CH- at 2.9 ppm). This forms a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is the methylene (-CH₂-) group. It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm (which makes the methyl group a triplet) and the methine group at 2.9 ppm. This forms a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **Putting it all together:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This complete structure is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl groups, including those in carboxylic acids, down to methylene (-CH₂-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups. It is a more potent version of the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH group is replaced by a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product Name: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**3. Match with Options**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n*   B) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is structurally incorrect.\n*   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** The starting material contains a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group. No rearrangement would occur.\n*   D) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\n**1. Analysis of the IR and NMR data to identify Compound X:**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a very distinctive broad absorption band, which is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* The data strongly suggest that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, a broad singlet far downfield, is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho (next to) the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Now, we determine the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **Total Protons:** 1H + 2H + 3H + 3H = 9H. This corresponds to a C₄H₉ (butyl) group.\n        *   **Signal Breakdown:**\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton. Its chemical shift indicates it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be a methine (-CH-) group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This methyl group is attached to the benzylic methine.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons. This must be the methylene group (-CH₂-) situated between the benzylic CH and the terminal CH₃ group.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        1.  We have a benzylic methine (`Ar-CH-`).\n        2.  A methyl group is attached to it (`Ar-CH(CH₃)-`).\n        3.  The remaining fragment is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which must also be attached to the benzylic methine.\n        4.  This forms the complete structure: `Ar-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2.

The frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *Conclusion from IR:* Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data of Compound X:**\n    Let's break down the spectrum to build the structure.\n\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) for one proton at such a high chemical shift (downfield) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is for protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** Now we need to determine the structure of the second substituent on the ring from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to multiple, non-equivalent protons. Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this -CH2- is next to a -CH3 group. The multiplicity suggests it's also adjacent to another group, likely the methine.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine proton (-CH-). Its downfield shift (2.9 ppm) suggests it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). Based on the doublet at 1.4 ppm, this -CH- is adjacent to a -CH3 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\n        *   We have a benzylic CH (methine) from the 2.9 ppm signal.\n        *   Attached to this CH is a CH3 group (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n        *   Also attached to this CH must be an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The CH2 is the 1.7 ppm signal, and the terminal CH3 is the 0.9 ppm triplet.\n        *   So, the alkyl group is -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:**\n        Putting everything together, we have a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and a *sec*-butyl group in a *para* arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3). It will also reduce alcohols and alkyl halides to alkanes, and ketones/aldehydes to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   The reaction is: Ar-COOH + 6 HI --(Red P)--> Ar-CH3 + 2 H2O + 3 I2. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the iodine (I2) produced.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by this reagent.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene**, which is more commonly named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** or 4-sec-butyltoluene.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our derived product structure.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
