    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:**\n    This problem involves a particle decay at rest, which is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (Pi+).\n        *   Initial momentum, $P_{initial} = 0$.\n        *   Initial energy, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$. Since it's stationary, its kinetic energy is zero, and its total energy is its rest mass energy. Given $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu) moving in opposite directions.\n        *   Final momentum, $P_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n        *   Final energy, $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    $P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n    $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    This implies $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n    Therefore, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $|p_{\\mu^+} | = | p_{\\nu} | = p$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the neutrino: Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$). Therefore, its energy is $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\n    Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n5.  **Solve for the momentum (pc):**\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n    The $(pc)^2$ terms cancel out. Now, solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi^+}c^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **Neutrino's KE:** For a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$). We also know $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    *   **Muon's KE:** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy: $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$. We can also find it using total energy conservation:\n        $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu} = (KE_{\\mu^+} + m_{\\mu^+}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$\n        $KE_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Now, let's use the given values to compute the results with a python script.\n\n```python\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) in MeV\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (assumed massless) is equal to pc\nke_neutrino = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the total energy available minus the energy taken by the neutrino\n# Total kinetic energy available = Initial rest energy - final rest energy\ntotal_ke = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nke_muon = total_ke - ke_neutrino\n\n# We round the final results to two decimal places to match the options.\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {ke_muon:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {ke_neutrino:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ). We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Decay process: π⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n*   The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺ ($m_{\\pi^+}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺ ($m_{\\mu^+}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (νμ) is considered to be massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its total momentum is zero. According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero.\n$P_{initial} = P_{final} = 0$\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n$p_{\\mu^+} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the stationary pion.\n$E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n*   Total energy of the muon: $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n*   Total energy of the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\nTherefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solving for the Energy of the Particles:**\nWe can rearrange the energy equation to solve for `pc` (the momentum-energy of the neutrino).\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\nSquaring both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\nSimplifying the equation by canceling the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides and solving for `pc`:\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi^+}c^2}$\n\n**5. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** For a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy. Therefore, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):** The total energy released in the decay is the difference in rest mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the product particles.\n    Total KE = $KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n    So, $KE_{\\mu^+} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n$m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n*   **Calculate $KE_{\\nu}$ (which is equal to pc):**\n    $KE_{\\nu} = pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\n*   **Calculate $KE_{\\mu^+}$:**\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.8 = 33.9 - 29.8 = 4.1$ MeV\n    Alternatively, we can use the result from the code output which calculated $KE_{\\mu^+} = 4.12$ MeV and $KE_{\\nu} = 29.78$ MeV.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is **4.12 MeV**, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is **29.8 MeV** (rounded from 29.78). This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
