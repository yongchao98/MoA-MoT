    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System Properties:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   **Rule for Fermions:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n        where 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The problem defines a base unit of energy E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as E_n = n²E.\n\n3.  **Account for Spin:**\n    *   Each particle has spin-1/2. This means for any given energy level 'n', there are two possible spin states: spin up (m_s = +1/2) and spin down (m_s = -1/2).\n    *   Because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    *   The ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy for the system. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available level.\n        *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n        *   E_g = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n    *   The ground state configuration is (n=1: 2 particles), (n=2: 2 particles).\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: (n=1: 2), (n=2: 2), (n=3: 0), ...\n    *   Highest Occupied Level is n=2. Lowest Unoccupied Level is n=3.\n    *   Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is:\n        *   n=1: 2 particles (Energy = 2 * 1²E = 2E)\n        *   n=2: 1 particle (Energy = 1 * 2²E = 4E)\n        *   n=3: 1 particle (Energy = 1 * 3²E = 9E)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        *   E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider different possible ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n    *   **Ground state energy:** 10E.\n    *   **First excited state energy:** 15E.\n    *   Let's explore other possible excited configurations and their energies:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (instead of from n=2).\n            *   Configuration: (n=1: 1), (n=2: 2), (n=3: 1).\n            *   Energy = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n            *   Configuration: (n=1: 2), (n=2: 0), (n=3: 2).\n            *   Energy = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n            *   Configuration: (n=1: 2), (n=2: 1), (n=4: 1).\n            *   Energy = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...\n    *   The lowest energy above the ground state is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest energy is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
