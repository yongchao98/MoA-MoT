    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) Their relative speed ($v_{rel}$).\nb) The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1 (A):\n    *   Rest mass: $m_A = 2m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_A = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Astronaut 2 (B):\n    *   Rest mass: $m_B = 3m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_B = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation**\n\n*   **For Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** Since the speeds are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them ($0.6c - 0.5c$). We must use the Lorentz transformation formula for velocities. The formula for the velocity of object A as seen from object B's reference frame is:\n    $v_{rel} = v_{AB} = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c^2)$\n\n*   **For Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma * m_{rest} * c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n    So, the total energy of the system will be:\n    $E_{total} = E_A + E_B = (\\gamma_A * m_A * c^2) + (\\gamma_B * m_B * c^2)$\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation**\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n*   Substitute the values into the velocity addition formula:\n    $v_{rel} = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)$\n*   Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n    $v_{rel} = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.30c^2) / c^2)$\n    $v_{rel} = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)$\n    $v_{rel} = 0.1c / 0.7$\n    $v_{rel} = (1/7)c$\n*   Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n*   First, calculate the energy for Astronaut A ($E_A$):\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}$\n        $\\gamma_A = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.64}$\n        $\\gamma_A = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25$\n    *   Calculate the energy, $E_A$:\n        $E_A = \\gamma_A * m_A * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2$\n        $E_A = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   Next, calculate the energy for Astronaut B ($E_B$):\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_B$:\n        $\\gamma_B = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v_B/c)^2} = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}$\n        $\\gamma_B = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 1 / \\sqrt{0.75}$\n        $\\gamma_B = 1 / (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 2/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Calculate the energy, $E_B$:\n        $E_B = \\gamma_B * m_B * c^2 = (2/\\sqrt{3}) * (3m) * c^2$\n        $E_B = (6/\\sqrt{3})mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n        $E_B \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   Finally, sum the energies to find the total energy:\n    $E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Finalize**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n*   Our calculated total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
