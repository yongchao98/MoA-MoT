    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical equilibrium:**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is described by the following equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca-EDTA^{2-}$\n\nThe given formation constant ($K_f$, also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n$Ca-EDTA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\nLet's denote the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that has dissociated from the complex at equilibrium.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $Ca-EDTA^{2-}$     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n*Note: We assume the pH is ideal, which means the EDTA is predominantly in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form and we don't need to consider its protonation states and the conditional formation constant.\n\n**3. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:**\n$K_f = \\frac{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This implies that the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nNow, solve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n$[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Verify the assumption:**\nWe assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02. Our calculated value for x is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$, which is indeed negligible compared to 0.02. The assumption is valid.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection:**\nThe calculated concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which matches option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Rearranging gives a quadratic equation: K_f * x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\n# Where x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions.\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0\na = K_f\nb = 1\nc = -initial_complex_conc\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# We take the positive root because concentration cannot be negative.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex is formed in a reversible reaction. Since we are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of free ions, we should consider the dissociation of the complex:\n$Ca-EDTA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Relate the equilibrium constant of dissociation ($K_d$) to the given formation constant ($K_f$).**\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca-EDTA^{2-}$ is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\nThe dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE table to track concentrations.**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of $Ca-EDTA^{2-}$ that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of both $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$ will be 'x'.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $Ca-EDTA^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x.**\nUsing the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]}$\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\nSince $K_d$ is very small, the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02. We can make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n\n**5. Conclusion.**\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A. The Python code in the initial step confirmed this calculation by solving the full quadratic equation without approximation, giving the result `6.32e-07`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
