    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A from the NMR data.**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6 protons (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4 protons (4H).\n    *   A signal for 6H suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH3). The triplet multiplicity means these methyl groups are adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n    *   A signal for 4H suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH2-). The quartet multiplicity means these methylene groups are adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3) according to the n+1 rule (3+1=4).\n    *   This pattern (CH3 next to CH2, and CH2 next to CH3) in a 6H:4H ratio points to a molecule with two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-).\n    *   The chemical shifts (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of an alkane.\n    *   The simplest symmetrical alkane with this structure is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). Due to symmetry, the two outer CH3 groups are equivalent (6H), and the two inner CH2 groups are equivalent (4H). The terminal CH3 protons are split by the adjacent CH2 protons into a triplet. The inner CH2 protons are split by the adjacent CH3 protons into a quartet. (Note: For a high-resolution spectrum, the CH2 signal would be more complex due to coupling with the other CH2 group, but for introductory problems, this simplified interpretation is standard).\n    *   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B (Monobromination of A).**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. Radical bromination of n-butane can occur at C1 (primary carbon) to give 1-bromobutane or at C2 (secondary carbon) to give 2-bromobutane.\n    *   The next reaction step will reveal which isomer is compound B.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C (Elimination of B).**\n    *   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a classic E2 elimination reaction to form an alkene.\n    *   The problem states that the product, C, has two geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3), which does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination yields but-1-ene (minor product) and but-2-ene (major product). But-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n    *   Since C has two geometrical isomers, **Compound B must be 2-bromobutane**, and **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D (Diels-Alder Reaction).**\n    *   Compound D is formed from the reaction of the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction.**\n    *   **Product Structure:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring. The diene provides four carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and the dienophile provides two (let's call them C5, C6). A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the original diene. The substituents from the reactants will be on the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n        *   From the diene: an -OH group on C1 and a -CH3 group on C4.\n        *   From the dienophile: a -CH3 group on C5 and a -CH3 group on C6.\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to is C1. The double bond gets the lowest number, so it's C2-C3. The methyl groups are therefore at positions 4, 5, and 6. The product is a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n6.  **Determine the Relative and Absolute Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Stereochemistry from the Diene:** We need to draw the reactive s-cis conformation of (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to determine which substituents are \"exo\" (pointing out) and \"endo\" (pointing in). For the (1E,3E) isomer, the C1-OH group and the C4-CH3 group both point \"exo\". Substituents that are both exo (or both endo) on the diene end up *cis* to each other in the product. Therefore, the **C1-OH and C4-CH3 groups are *cis*** in the final product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry from the Dienophile:** The reaction is stereospecific. Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (on C5 and C6) will be ***cis*** to each other in the product.\n    *   **Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule dictates the relative orientation of the diene and dienophile. The substituents on the dienophile preferentially align *cis* to the *endo* substituents of the diene. In our diene, the *exo* groups are C1-OH and C4-CH3. This means the dienophile's methyl groups will be ***trans*** to both the C1-OH and C4-CH3 groups.\n    *   **Combining the Stereochemical Information:**\n        1.  The C5-CH3 and C6-CH3 groups are *cis* to each other.\n        2.  The C1-OH and C4-CH3 groups are *cis* to each other.\n        3.  The pair of methyls at C5/C6 is *trans* to the pair of substituents at C1/C4.\n    *   Let's draw this specific isomer. We can place the C1-OH and C4-CH3 groups \"up\" (on a wedge). Then, the C5-CH3 and C6-CH3 groups must be \"down\" (on a dash).\n        *   C1-OH: up (wedge) -> C1-H is down (dash)\n        *   C4-CH3: up (wedge) -> C4-H is down (dash)\n        *   C5-CH3: down (dash) -> C5-H is up (wedge)\n        *   C6-CH3: down (dash) -> C6-H is up (wedge)\n    *   **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n        *   **C1:** Priorities: OH > C2(C=C) > C6 > H. H is dash. The sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. Configuration is **(1S)**.\n        *   **C4:** Priorities: C3(C=C) > C5 > CH3 > H. H is dash. The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. Configuration is **(4R)**.\n        *   **C5:** Priorities: C6 > C4 > CH3 > H. H is wedge. The sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise (S). Because H is on a wedge, we reverse the assignment. Configuration is **(5S)**.\n        *   **C6:** Priorities: C1(C-OH) > C5 > CH3 > H. H is on a wedge. The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise (R). Because H is on a wedge, we reverse the assignment. Configuration is **(6R)**.\n\n    *   The final product is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This corresponds to option A. Note that the reaction produces a racemic mixture of this compound and its enantiomer, (1R,4S,5R,6S), but only one is listed as an option.\n\n<<<A>>>"
