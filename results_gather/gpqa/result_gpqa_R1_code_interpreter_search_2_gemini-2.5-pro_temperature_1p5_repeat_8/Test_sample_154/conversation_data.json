    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$. The uncertainty is defined by the formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\nwhere $\\langle O \\rangle$ represents the expectation value of an operator $O$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle O \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|O|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given by the matrix:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\nThe bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it is just the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the matrix for $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\nNow we can calculate the variance $(\\Delta P_z)^2$:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nFinally, the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is the square root of the variance:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nTo verify the result, let's use a Python script to perform the matrix calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the state vector psi.
