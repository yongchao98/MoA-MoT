    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Concepts:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$), also called the proper lifetime, is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This dilated lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$). So, the mean decay distance $L = v \\tau$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$, where $E$ is the total energy and $m$ is the rest mass. The particle's speed is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$. The relationship between energy, momentum ($p$), and mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  Express the mean decay distance $L$ in terms of the given quantities ($E_X$, $m_X$, $\\Gamma_X$).\n    b.  Use fundamental constants like the speed of light ($c$) and the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$). It's often convenient to use the combined constant $\\hbar c$.\n    c.  Substitute the given numerical values and calculate the final result.\n    d.  Compare the result with the given options.\n\n4.  **Step-by-step Derivation:**\n    *   The mean decay distance is $L = v \\tau$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$:  $L = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    *   Since $v = \\beta c$, this becomes $L = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\beta (c \\tau_0)$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$:  $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Now, we need to find the term $\\gamma \\beta$. We can express it in terms of energy and mass.\n        *   From the energy-momentum relation, $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$. So, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n        *   We also know that momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$. So, $pc = \\gamma \\beta (m_X c^2)$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the formula for $L$:\n        $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   This formula contains all the given quantities and fundamental constants.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$ (The mass given is $m_X c^2$)\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Fundamental constant:**\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$)\n    *   **Calculate the momentum term ($pc$):**\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Calculate the factor $\\gamma \\beta$:**\n        *   $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{7909.5 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 6.5912$\n    *   **Calculate the proper decay length ($c\\tau_0$):**\n        *   $c\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n    *   **Calculate the final mean decay distance ($L$):**\n        *   $L = \\gamma \\beta \\times (c\\tau_0)$\n        *   $L = 6.5912 \\times 0.6166 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0645 \\text{ fm}$\n    *   **Convert to meters:**\n        *   Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$,\n        *   $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is very close to option D.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8000  # MeV\nm_X = 1200  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # MeV\n\n# Fundamental constants\nhbar_c = 197.327  # MeV fm\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) in MeV\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n# The formula for mean decay distance L is:\n# L = (pc / m_X) * (hbar * c / Gamma_X)\n# All units are in MeV, so the resulting unit for L will be fm.\nL_fm = (pc / m_X) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert fm to meters (1 fm = 1e-15 m)\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e} m\")\n```\n>4.0645e-15 m\n\nThe calculation yields $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The mean decay distance of a particle in the laboratory frame ($L$) is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$).\n\n1.  **Lifetime:**\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), which is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame, is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   The lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is dilated due to relativistic effects:\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, given by $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Distance:**\n    *   The mean decay distance is $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    *   We can write this as $L = (\\gamma \\beta) c \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   Let's find the term $\\gamma \\beta$. We know that momentum $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$.
