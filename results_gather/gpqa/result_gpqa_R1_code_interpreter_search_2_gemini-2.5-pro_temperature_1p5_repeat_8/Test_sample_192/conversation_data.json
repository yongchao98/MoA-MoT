    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This describes the number of stars found per unit interval of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality for the differential number count with respect to parallax:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is asking for the proportionality of the differential number count with respect to distance:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^?`\n\n3.  **Establish the Core Relationship:**\n    The fundamental relationship between distance `r` and parallax `plx` is that they are inversely proportional. For a star at distance `r` (in parsecs), the parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Relate the Differentials:**\n    To convert a distribution from being a function of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) to a function of distance (`dN/dr`), we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative Term `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    For proportionality, we are interested in how the magnitude scales, so we can consider the relationship:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Proportionalities:**\n    Now substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation. Note that when transforming densities, we use the absolute value of the Jacobian (the derivative term), as the number of stars `dN` in a given corresponding interval must be positive.\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of Distance `r`:**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r` to substitute for `plx`:\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute `plx⁻⁵ = r⁵` back into the combined proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`). This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
