    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in the tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or some nitrogen oxides (like NO₂). The mass of this tube did not change, which means no such acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the gas that reacted contained oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (that reacted with Cu) = Mass / Molar mass = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that provided this oxygen passed through the Ca(OH)₂ solution, so it is not acidic. Likely candidates are O₂, N₂O, or NO.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Amounts**\n\nLet's deduce the identities of the initial gaseous products before they entered the tubes. The final gas collected is 0.10 mol of N₂. This N₂ could be formed directly from the decomposition or from the reaction in Tube №3.\n\n*   The reaction in Tube №3 involves an oxidizing gas reacting with Cu. Let's consider the possibilities for this gas, which supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n    *   If the gas was nitrous oxide (N₂O): The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O, we need 0.05 mol of N₂O. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   The total final N₂ is 0.10 mol. If 0.05 mol came from the N₂O reaction, the other 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the initial gas mixture.\n\nSo, the initial mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe know the total mass of the initial mixture of salts A and B is 7.20 g, and it's an equimolar mixture (let's say 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B).\n\nThe products (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂) must come from the decomposition of n moles of A and n moles of B.\nThe simplest assumption is that one salt decomposes to give N₂O and H₂O, and the other decomposes to give N₂ and H₂O.\n\n*   Let's check the stoichiometry:\n    *   n moles of A → 0.05 mol of N₂O\n    *   n moles of B → 0.05 mol of N₂\n    *   This implies **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nNow let's see how the H₂O is produced:\n*   Total H₂O = 0.20 mol. This must come from both decompositions.\n*   Decomposition of A: 0.05 mol A → 0.05 mol N₂O + x H₂O\n*   Decomposition of B: 0.05 mol B → 0.05 mol N₂ + y H₂O\n*   Total H₂O = x + y = 0.20 mol. The simplest balanced distribution would be x = 0.10 mol and y = 0.10 mol.\n\nSo the reactions are:\n*   0.05 mol A → 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O (or 1 A → 1 N₂O + 2 H₂O)\n*   0.05 mol B → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O (or 1 B → 1 N₂ + 2 H₂O)\n\nLet's identify the salts based on these decomposition reactions:\n*   **Reaction A: A → N₂O + 2H₂O.** This is the classic decomposition of **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₃ is N₂H₄O₃. It balances: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Reaction B: B → N₂ + 2H₂O.** This is the classic decomposition of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₂ is N₂H₄O₂. It balances: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\n**4. Verify with the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2(14) + 4(1) + 3(16) = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2(14) + 4(1) + 2(16) = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Mass of A = 0.05 mol × 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Mass of B = 0.05 mol × 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.0\nM_O = 16.0\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.0\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.0\n\n# Given values\nmass_mixture = 7.20 # g\nmass_H2O_produced = 3.60 # g\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80 # g\nvolume_final_gas = 2.24 # L\n\n# --- Calculations to verify the identity of the salts ---\n\n# Moles of H2O from tube 1\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O_produced / M_H2O\n# Moles of O atoms reacted with Cu in tube 3\nmoles_O_in_oxide = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\n# Moles of final gas (N2)\nmoles_N2_final = volume_final_gas / 22.4\n\n# Hypothesis: The gases are H2O, N2O, and N2.\n# N2O supplies the oxygen to Cu. So, moles_N2O = moles_O_in_oxide = 0.05 mol.\n# The N2O decomposes to N2 in tube 3: N2O -> N2. So, 0.05 mol N2 is formed in tube 3.\n# The total final N2 is 0.10 mol. So, moles_N2_initial = moles_N2_final - moles_N2_from_N2O = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.\n# Thus, the decomposition produced: 0.20 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n\n# Hypothesis: The salts are NH4NO3 (A) and NH4NO2 (B) in an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each.\n# A: n NH4NO3 -> n N2O + 2n H2O\n# B: n NH4NO2 -> n N2 + 2n H2O\n# Total products: n N2O + n N2 + 4n H2O.\n# From the amounts calculated above, if n=0.05, this matches perfectly.\nn = 0.05\n\n# Verify initial mass\ncalculated_mass = n * M_NH4NO3 + n * M_NH4NO2\n# print(f\"Calculated initial mass: {calculated_mass} g\")\n# print(f\"Given initial mass: {mass_mixture} g\")\n\n# --- Final Answer Calculation ---\n# Salt A is NH4NO3: 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms\n# Salt B is NH4NO2: 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms\ntotal_atoms = 9 + 8\nprint(\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is:\")\nprint(total_atoms)\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",

The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning a gas containing oxygen reacted with the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since this gas passed through Tube №2 without reacting, it is not an acidic oxide. A likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`.\n        *   According to the reaction stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O to form CuO. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that reacted is 0.05 mol. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This remaining gas is what passed through all tubes unreacted *plus* any product from tube №3. We deduced that 0.05 mol of N₂ was produced in tube №3. The gas C must be nitrogen (N₂), as it's inert under these conditions.\n        *   Therefore, the total amount of N₂ at the end is 0.10 mol. Since 0.05 mol of N₂ was formed from the N₂O in tube 3, the initial gas mixture must have contained `0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol` of N₂ gas.\n\n2.  **Summarize the Initial Gas Mixture:**\n    The decomposition of salts A and B produced a mixture of gases with the following composition:\n    *   0.20 mol H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂O\n    *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   The problem states that salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The products (N₂, N₂O, H₂O) suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts.\n        *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) is: `NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O`\n        *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) is: `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`\n    *   Let's hypothesize that A and B are these two salts.\n        *   If `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ decompose, they produce `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n        *   If `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ decompose, they produce `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   From our product analysis, we have 0.05 mol of N₂O and 0.05 mol of N₂. This perfectly matches our hypothesis if `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   Let's check the amount of water produced. Total H₂O should be `2n + 2n = 4n`. With `n=0.05`, the total H₂O is `4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol`. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n    *   So, Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂ (or vice versa).\n\n4.  **Verify the Total Mass:**\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 × 14.0) + (4 × 1.0) + (3 × 16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 × 14.0) + (4 × 1.0) + (2 × 16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass given in the problem, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts:** 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\n```python\n# Final calculation to confirm the total number of atoms.\n# Salt A is identified as Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 3\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is identified as Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# N: 2, H: 4, O: 2\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of both salts\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is:\")\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
