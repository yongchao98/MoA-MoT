    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    The system consists of a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a charge reservoir (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V=0`). The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. Due to the presence of charge `q`, charges will be induced on the surface of the conductor to maintain the `V=0` condition. The potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the electric field created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This electrostatic problem is greatly simplified by the \"method of images\". We can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an imaginary \"image\" charge, `q'`, placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the spherical surface where the conductor used to be.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Location:** It is placed at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n    With this setup, the potential at any point on the surface `r=R` due to `q` and `q'` is zero, satisfying the boundary condition of the grounded sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is now identical to the field produced by the two point charges `q` and `q'`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Force on the Charge `q`:**\n    The net force on the real charge `q` is due to the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`.\n    Let's substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2`\n    `F = - (k * q^2 * R / d) * (d^2 / (d^2 - R^2)^2)`\n    `F(d) = - k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, pulling the charge `q` towards the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy (`U`) of the system is the work done to assemble it. A common method is to calculate the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The potential energy is the negative of the work done by the electric field (`W_field`) during this process.\n    `U = -W_field = - ∫[infinity to d] F(x) dx`\n    Here, `F(x)` is the force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center.\n    `F(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    Now, we integrate:\n    `U = - ∫[infinity to d] (- k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[infinity to d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `infinity` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(infinity - R^2))) ]`\n    The term with `infinity` in the denominator goes to zero.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Answer Comparison:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
