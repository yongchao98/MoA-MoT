    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE helps determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (triplet, t):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 hydrogens (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (quartet, q):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 hydrogens (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Conclusion from these two signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and together indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift of the -CH₂- group (4.5 ppm) suggests it is bonded to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (broad singlet, bs):** This is characteristic of protons on a heteroatom that can undergo exchange, like O-H or N-H. Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, as are the two on the other side.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) are shielded and appear upfield (at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOR) are deshielded and appear downfield (at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester isomer where the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm (next to -O-).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is meta-substituted, not para, and is a primary amide, not an ester.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure matches all the data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
