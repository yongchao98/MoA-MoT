    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum of the initial NN system is `J_i = 0`.\n\nWe also need the parity of the initial state. The total parity is given by `P = P_1 * P_2 * (-1)^L`, where `P_1` and `P_2` are the intrinsic parities of the nucleons. Nucleons (protons and neutrons) have positive intrinsic parity (`+1`).\n*   `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^{L_i} = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i^P = 0^+`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nThe final state consists of the final two-nucleon system `NN(final)` described by a term symbol `(2S'+1)L'(J')`, and the emitted particle `X`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for each proposed transition:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem states that `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   So, the condition for the final state `(S', L')` is `0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `S' + L' + 1` being an even number, which means `S' + L'` must be an **odd number**.\n\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_i = J_f`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J'` and the angular momentum of particle X. Let's denote the orbital angular momentum of X by `L_X` (given by the lowercase letters s, p, d, f) and its spin by `S_X`. The problem gives no information on `S_X`, but for such emitted particles (like a pion), it is standard to assume it is a spin-0 particle (`S_X = 0`). In this case, the total angular momentum of X is just `L_X`.\n    *   `J_f` is the vector sum of `J'` and `L_X`. For `J_f` to be 0 (to match `J_i=0`), `J'` and `L_X` must be equal in magnitude: `J' = L_X`.\n\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state (`P_i = P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P_{NN,final} * P_X * P_{orbital,X}`.\n    *   `P_{NN,final} = (-1)^{L'}` (since intrinsic parities of nucleons are +1).\n    *   `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_{orbital,X} = (-1)^{L_X}`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} = (-1)^{L' + L_X + 1}`.\n    *   For `P_f` to equal `P_i = +1`, the exponent `L' + L_X + 1` must be an even number. This means `L' + L_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against the three derived rules:\n1.  `S' + L'` must be odd.\n2.  `J' = L_X`.\n3.  `L' + L_X` must be odd.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n*   Check 1 (Pauli): `S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Check 2 (J conservation): `J'=3`, `L_X=3`. `J' = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Check 3 (Parity): `L' + L_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S'+1=7` => `S'=3`. `L'=2` (D-state), `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   The state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles cannot combine to form a total spin `S=3` (they can only form `S=0` or `S=1`). Therefore, this transition is fundamentally not permitted. However, let's check the given rules mechanically.\n*   Check 1 (Pauli): `S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Check 2 (J conservation): `J'=1`, `L_X=1`. `J' = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Check 3 (Parity): `L' + L_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: While this option satisfies the three specific rules, the final state `7D1` itself is impossible for an NN system.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n*   Check 1 (Pauli): `S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.** The rule requires `S' + L'` to be odd.\n*   Check 2 (J conservation): `J'=0`, `L_X=0`. `J' = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Check 3 (Parity): `L' + L_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition explicitly given in the problem.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   Check 1 (Pauli): `S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Check 2 (J conservation): `J'=1`, `L_X=1`. `J' = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Check 3 (Parity): `L' + L_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for two nucleons (`S=3` is not allowed).\n*   Option C is forbidden because the transition violates the Pauli principle selection rule (`T = S+L+1 mod 2` with `T=0`) that was explicitly provided in the question.\n\nIn the context of such physics problems, one is expected to apply the specific rules and conservation laws mentioned. Option C is the only one that fails a direct application of the rules given for the *transition*, while option B's issue is with the physical possibility of the *state itself*. The question asks which partial wave is not permitted, focusing on the dynamics of the decay. The failure in C is a violation of these dynamics based on the provided Pauli rule. Therefore, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
