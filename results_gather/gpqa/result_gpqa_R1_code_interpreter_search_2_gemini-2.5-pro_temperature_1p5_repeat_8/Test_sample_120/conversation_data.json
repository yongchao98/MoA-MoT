    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` core structure corresponds to a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. The bicyclo numbering designates these carbons as C1 and C6.\n    *   The molecule has methyl substituents at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry at the four chiral centers is given: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S.\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The reactive species is the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻). This reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The problem explicitly states two rules for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides:\n    1.  The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  The attack causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n### 2. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regiochemistry)\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We need to identify which one is less sterically hindered.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached to it.\n*   Carbon C6 has only hydrogen atoms attached (besides being part of the ring).\n*   A carbon atom with a methyl group (a tertiary carbon, considering the ring connections) is significantly more sterically hindered than a carbon with only hydrogens (a secondary carbon).\n*   Therefore, following Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) will attack **C6**.\n\n*   This conclusion allows us to eliminate options A and D. Both options A and D describe a `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. A 2,2-dimethyl pattern (a gem-dimethyl group) on the carbon adjacent to the OH-bearing carbon would only arise if the nucleophilic methyl group attacked C1 (which already had a methyl group). Since we've established the attack occurs at C6, the product must have a methyl group at C1 (original), a new methyl group at C2 (originally C6), and other methyls at C4 and C5 (originally C4 and C3). The resulting product structure is `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. Thus, the correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\n*   We now need to distinguish between option B `(1R,2S,4R,5R)` and option C `(1R,2R,4R,5R)`. The difference lies in the stereochemistry at C2.\n*   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6 of the starting material. The resulting hydroxyl (-OH) group will be on C1, and the new C2 of the product corresponds to the original C6 of the reactant.\n*   According to Rule 2, the attack causes an inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon.\n*   The starting material has an **S** configuration at C6 (`6S`).\n*   Therefore, after the nucleophilic attack and inversion, the corresponding carbon in the product (which is C2 in the final IUPAC name) must have an **R** configuration.\n*   The configuration at C2 of the product must be **R**.\n\n### 4. Final Product Identification\n\n*   The product has the structure `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n*   The stereocenter at C2 must have the `R` configuration.\n*   Let's check the options again:\n    *   A) (1R,4R,5R)-**2,2**,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect regiochemistry.\n    *   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n    *   C) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Correct regiochemistry and correct stereochemistry at C2.\n    *   D) (1S,4R,5S)-**2,2**,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol -> Incorrect regiochemistry.\n\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C4, C5 in the product) correspond to C1, C4, and C3 in the reactant. Their configurations are not inverted. The configuration at C1 in the reactant is `R`, and it remains `R`. The configurations at C4 and C3 (`R` and `R`) become the configurations at C4 and C5 in the product, also `R` and `R`. Therefore, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R), which exactly matches option C.\n\nThe logical deduction based on the provided reaction rules points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
