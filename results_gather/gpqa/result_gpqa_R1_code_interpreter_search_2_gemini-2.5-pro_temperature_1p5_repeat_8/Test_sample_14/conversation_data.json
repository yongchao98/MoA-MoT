    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (Prob1) with that of Planet_2 (Prob2) and find the ratio `Prob1 / Prob2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability for a planet to transit its host star is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (the semi-major axis for a circular orbit).\n    `Prob_transit ∝ R_s / a`\n    Where:\n    *   `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** We don't know the semi-major axes directly, but we can find them using Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_s`). The planet's mass (`M_p`) is negligible compared to the star's mass (`M_s >> M_p`).\n    `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n    `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Formulas:** Now, substitute the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula:\n    `Prob_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** To compare the two planets, we create a ratio of their transit probabilities:\n    `Ratio = Prob1 / Prob2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n    This can be rearranged to group the terms for stars and planets:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Information:**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n    *   The period of Planet_2 is three times that of Planet_1: `P2 = 3 * P1`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute these values back into the ratio formula:\n    `Ratio = 1 * [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** To find the numerical value of the ratio, we calculate the cube root of 4.5. This will tell us which planet is more likely to transit and by what factor.\n\n```python\nimport math\nratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.650964024403372\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio `Prob1 / Prob2` is approximately 1.65. This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's semi-major axis, assuming a random inclination of the orbital plane. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is simply the orbital radius.\n\nLet's denote the transit probability as `Prob_T`.\n`Prob_T ∝ R_s / a`\nwhere `R_s` is the stellar radius and `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period `P` is related to the semi-major axis `a` and the mass of the host star `M_s` (since the planet's mass is negligible):\n`P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n`a³ ∝ P² * M_s`\n`a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for `a` into our probability formula:\n`Prob_T ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (`Prob_T1 / Prob_T2`).\n\n`Ratio = Prob_T1 / Prob_T2 = [R_s1 / (P1² * M_s1)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (P2² * M_s2)^(1/3)]`\n\nLet's rearrange the terms:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\nNow we plug in the values from the problem description:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n3.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = 1 * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = [ (1/2) * 3² ]^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = [ 9 / 2 ]^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe code output shows that `(4.5)^(1/3)` is approximately 1.65.\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred observation target.\n\n<<<A>>>"
