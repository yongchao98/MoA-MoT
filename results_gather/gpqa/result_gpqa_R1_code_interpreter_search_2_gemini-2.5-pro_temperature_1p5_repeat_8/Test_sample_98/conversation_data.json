    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is due to the dynamic nature of these bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the structures.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides key information about two specific signals in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo have both these signals, the molecule must contain at least two different protons with very specific sets of neighbors. Let's analyze what gives rise to these splitting patterns using the `n+1 rule`, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   **For a `dtq` (doublet of triplets of quartets):** The proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (1H), which splits the signal into a **doublet**. This is typically a methine (-CH) group neighbor.\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2H), which split the signal into a **triplet**. This is typically a methylene (-CH2) group neighbor.\n    *   Three equivalent protons (3H), which split the signal into a **quartet**. This is typically a methyl (-CH3) group neighbor.\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtq` signal must be located next to a -CH group, a -CH2 group, and a -CH3 group.\n\n*   **For a `dtt` (doublet of triplets of triplets):** The proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (1H), splitting the signal into a **doublet** (-CH neighbor).\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2H), splitting the signal into a **triplet** (-CH2 neighbor).\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent protons (2H), splitting the signal into a second **triplet** (another -CH2 neighbor).\n    *   Therefore, the proton producing the `dtt` signal must be located next to a -CH group and two different -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nNow, let's examine each of the four possible structures to see which one has protons with the required neighboring groups to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. We will interpret the condensed formulas as linear chains where groups in parentheses are branches on the preceding carbon atom.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n    This formula, interpreted as `CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`, is structurally impossible as the second CH group from the left would have 5 bonds. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n    This corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw and label the non-acidic protons:\n    `CH3(f)-CH2(e)-CH(c)(CH3,d)-CH(a)(CH3,b)-COOH`\n    *   **Let's analyze proton H(c):**\n        *   It is adjacent to proton `H(a)` (a 1H neighbor, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH2(e)` group (a 2H neighbor, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH3(d)` group (a 3H neighbor, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(c) is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described in the problem.\n    *   **Can we find a `dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires a proton to be adjacent to one -CH group and two -CH2 groups. This molecule only contains one -CH2 group (`CH2(e)`). It is therefore structurally impossible for this molecule to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n    This corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ` (CH3)2CH(c)-CH(a)(CH3,b)-CH2(e)-COOH `\n    *   Let's analyze proton `H(a)`: It is adjacent to `H(c)` (1H, doublet), `CH3(b)` (3H, quartet), and `CH2(e)` (2H, triplet). This would produce a `dqt` (doublet of quartets of triplets), not a `dtq`.\n    *   Let's analyze proton `H(c)`: It is adjacent to `H(a)` (1H, doublet) and two `CH3` groups (6H, septet). This would produce a `ds` (doublet of septets).\n    *   This molecule produces neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n    This corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    ` CH3(f)-CH2(e)-CH(c)(Et,d)-CH(a)(Et,b)-COOH `\n    *   **Let's analyze proton H(c):**\n        *   It is adjacent to `H(a)` (a 1H neighbor, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH2(e)` group (a 2H neighbor, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the -CH2- of its own ethyl group `(d)` (another 2H neighbor, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(c) is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n    *   **Can we find a `dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires a proton to be adjacent to a -CH, a -CH2, and a -CH3 group. No proton in this molecule satisfies this condition. For instance, any proton on a -CH2 group (like `CH2(e)`) is next to a -CH, a -CH3, and its geminal partner (1H), which would give a `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets), not a `dtq`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis reveals a contradiction in the problem statement:\n*   Molecule B produces a `dtq` but cannot produce a `dtt`.\n*   Molecule D produces a `dtt` but cannot produce a `dtq`.\n*   Molecules A and C are incorrect.\n\nThis suggests a likely error in the question, where a compound that shows one of these signals was described as showing both. However, we must choose the best option. The structure required to produce a `dtq` signal is perfectly represented by proton `H(c)` in molecule B. This proton is located at a branch point (`C3`) with exactly the required neighbors: `CH(a)`, `CH2(e)`, and `CH3(d)`. This is a classic textbook example for such a splitting pattern. The claim of a `dtt` signal is most likely the erroneous part of the problem description for this molecule.\n\nGiven the choices, molecule B is the only one that unambiguously produces one of the highly specific splitting patterns described (`dtq`).\n\n<<<B>>>"
