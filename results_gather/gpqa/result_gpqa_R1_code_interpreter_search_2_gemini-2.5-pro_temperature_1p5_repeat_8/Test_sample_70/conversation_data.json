    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (D). The relationship is derived from balancing the absorbed stellar energy with the radiated thermal energy.\n    *   Energy Absorbed ∝ `(1 - A) / D^2`\n    *   Energy Radiated ∝ `T_eq^4`\n    *   Setting them equal: `T_eq^4 ∝ (1 - A) / D^2`\n    *   Taking the fourth root: `T_eq ∝ [(1 - A) / D^2]^(1/4)`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship:** The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A). The luminosity of the central star (L) is also a constant for both planets. Therefore, we can simplify the proportionality:\n    *   `T_eq ∝ (1 / D^2)^(1/4)`\n    *   `T_eq ∝ 1 / D^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(D)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:** We don't have the distances (D), but we have the orbital periods (T). Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period to the orbital distance (semi-major axis, which is the radius D for a circular orbit). For planets orbiting the same star:\n    *   `T^2 ∝ D^3`\n    *   To express D in terms of T, we can write: `D ∝ T^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now, substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the simplified temperature equation.\n    *   We have `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(D)` and `D ∝ T^(2/3)`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(T^(2/3))`\n    *   Simplifying the exponent: `sqrt(T^(2/3)) = (T^(2/3))^(1/2) = T^((2/3) * (1/2)) = T^(1/3)`\n    *   So, the final relationship is `T_eq ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / T4^(1/3)) / (1 / T2^(1/3))`\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = T2^(1/3) / T4^(1/3)`\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods `T1:T2:T3:T4:T5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we can find the ratio `T2 / T4`.\n    *   `T2` corresponds to the value `2`.\n    *   `T4` corresponds to the value `3.5`.\n    *   So, `T2 / T4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation.\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    *   To perform this calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is (T2/T4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = period_ratio_T2_over_T4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.829871790074251\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.82987. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 0.83. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
