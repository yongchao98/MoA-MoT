    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain (hexane) with a ketone at position 3, a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   The molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 5, and its stereochemistry is specified as (S).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`\n    *   Since it is enantiomerically pure (only the S-enantiomer is used), it is a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged.\n    *   The starting material is chiral. The attack of the hydride ion on the prochiral carbonyl carbon can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers at C3 (R and S).\n    *   The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one of their two chiral centers. By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any chiral centers. It is **achiral**.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reagent is excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 methylene group. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol is the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II are a mixture of three stereoisomers: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatography Analysis**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined and analyzed by two types of HPLC. We must assume that the products from Reaction I are structurally different enough from the products of Reaction II that they will not have identical retention times by chance.\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic mixture (a pair of enantiomers) and a meso compound. The two enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time, giving a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC Analysis:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic mixture and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral. It will not be resolved and will elute as a single peak. Since it is a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, it will have a distinct retention time. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from enantiomers) + 1 peak (from meso) = **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
