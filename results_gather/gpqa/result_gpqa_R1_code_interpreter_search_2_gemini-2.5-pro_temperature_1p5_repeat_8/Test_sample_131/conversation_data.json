    "This problem requires us to deduce the identities of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their combined 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the spectral data and then predicting the spectra for each of the possible compounds.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This is consistent with a tetramethylbenzene or a diethylbenzene structure.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons contributed by each compound to the overall spectrum is equal.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with an integral ratio of **1:1**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that each compound must produce a single aromatic singlet, and these two singlets have different chemical shifts. The protons contributing to these signals must not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with an integral ratio of **2:1:1**. These signals arise from the alkyl (methyl or ethyl) protons. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, suggesting the protons of these alkyl groups are not coupled to any other non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **2. Prediction of 1H NMR Spectra for Each Option**\n\nLet's examine each of the four possible compounds:\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to the high symmetry of the molecule. They would give a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The two ethyl groups are equivalent. However, within each ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3- protons. This would result in a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because its aliphatic signals are not singlets. This rules out option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They give **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (which would normally lead to splitting), their chemical equivalence makes them appear as a **single singlet (2H)** in many cases (an AA' system).\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H + 6H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic Protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton neighbor. Therefore, they give **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   Aliphatic Protons: All four methyl groups are in unique environments. This would theoretically produce four different singlets. However, due to accidental chemical shift equivalence, the spectrum typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H + 1H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H + 3H + 3H).\n\n### **3. Assembling the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nNow let's see which 1:1 mixture matches the observed spectrum. The target spectrum is: **2 aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio)** and **3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio)**.\n\n*   **Mixture B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   Total: **Two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, the integrals will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   Total: **Three singlets**. The integral ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This combination perfectly explains the observed spectrum.\n\nLet's quickly check why other combinations fail:\n\n*   **Mixture C: Durene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aromatic Region: Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **3 aromatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Mixture D: Prehnitene + Isodurene**\n    *   Aromatic Region: Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **3 aromatic singlets**. This contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
