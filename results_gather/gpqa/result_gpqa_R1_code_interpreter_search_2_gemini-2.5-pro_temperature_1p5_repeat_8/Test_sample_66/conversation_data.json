    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in a p-orbital. Their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The combined system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L^2$ with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$, and an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Target Outcome:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the angular momentum of the individual electrons, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of the outcome where *both* measurements yield the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\n    *   For particle 1, $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1$.\n    *   For particle 2, $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state $|l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n    The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled product state:\n    $|\\phi_{outcome}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum**\n\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|\\psi\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum must yield $-1\\hbar$.\n\n    The proposed measurement outcome has individual z-component eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ and $-\\hbar$. If this outcome occurred, the total z-component of angular momentum for the system would be the sum of these eigenvalues:\n    $L_z(\\text{outcome}) = L_{1z}(\\text{outcome}) + L_{2z}(\\text{outcome}) = (-\\hbar) + (-\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$.\n\n    This implies a total magnetic quantum number of $m_{total} = -2$. However, the system is in a state with $m = -1$. Since the measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum ($m_{total} \\neq m$), the probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**\n\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|\\phi_{outcome}\\rangle$ when it is initially in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi_{outcome} | \\psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    To calculate this, we can express the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ in the uncoupled basis using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The expansion for $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ formed from two $l=1$ states is:\n    $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = C_{0,-1,-1}^{1,1,2} |1, 0\\rangle_1|1, -1\\rangle_2 + C_{-1,0,-1}^{1,1,2} |1, -1\\rangle_1|1, 0\\rangle_2$\n    From standard tables, the coefficients are $C_{0,-1,-1}^{1,1,2} = \\sqrt{1/2}$ and $C_{-1,0,-1}^{1,1,2} = \\sqrt{1/2}$.\n    So, $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sqrt{1/2} |1, 0\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2 + \\sqrt{1/2} |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, 0\\rangle_2$.\n\n    The state of the desired outcome is $|\\phi_{outcome}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n    Now we compute the inner product:\n    $\\langle \\phi_{outcome} | \\psi \\rangle = \\left( \\langle 1, -1|_1 \\langle 1, -1|_2 \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{1/2} |1, 0\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2 + \\sqrt{1/2} |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, 0\\rangle_2 \\right)$\n    \n    Using the orthogonality of the basis states, $\\langle l,m | l,m' \\rangle = \\delta_{mm'}$:\n    $\\langle \\phi_{outcome} | \\psi \\rangle = \\sqrt{1/2} \\langle 1, -1 | 1, 0 \\rangle_1 \\langle 1, -1 | 1, -1 \\rangle_2 + \\sqrt{1/2} \\langle 1, -1 | 1, -1 \\rangle_1 \\langle 1, -1 | 1, 0 \\rangle_2$\n    $\\langle \\phi_{outcome} | \\psi \\rangle = \\sqrt{1/2} (0)(1) + \\sqrt{1/2} (1)(0) = 0$\n\n    The probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
