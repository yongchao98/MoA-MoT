    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet1 and Planet2), denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Identify Necessary Formulas:**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (Radius R_star and Temperature T_eff_star) and the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis `a`) and albedo (A).\n    T_eq = T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity (RV):** The Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K), which is induced by the orbiting planet.\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength.\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Parameters:** For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (sin(i)≈1, which is implied by the transit detection), the RV amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n**3. Formulate a Plan to Find the Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Write down the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n    Using the formula for T_eq:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n*   **Step 2: Simplify the temperature ratio.**\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_eff_star and R_star are the same and cancel out. It is also given that the albedo is the same for both planets (A1 = A2), so the albedo term (1-A)^(1/4) also cancels out.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    This means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1).\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate the semi-major axis `a` to the given quantities.**\n    From the RV amplitude formula: K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star)).\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    K² = M_p² * (G / (a * M_star))\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio a2 / a1.**\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star) ]\n    The constants G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / M_p1²) * (K1² / K2²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n*   **Step 5: Relate the RV amplitude ratio (K1 / K2) to the given Doppler shifts (Δλ).**\n    From K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), we can see that K is directly proportional to Δλ (since `c` and λ_0 are constant for both measurements).\n    Therefore, K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\n*   **Step 6: Substitute the Doppler shift ratio into the semi-major axis ratio.**\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)²\n\n*   **Step 7: Substitute the result for a2/a1 back into the temperature ratio equation.**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n*   **Step 8: Plug in the given values and calculate the final result.**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation using Python:**\nTo get a precise decimal value for the ratio, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\n# Masses of the planets (in Earth masses, the units cancel out)\nM_p1 = 7.0\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts (in Angstroms, the units cancel out)\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 can be derived as:\n# T_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nT_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet1 and Planet2).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** Calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):**\n    The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms cancel out.\n    *   The factor of `2` inside the square root also cancels.\n    This simplifies the expression to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    So, to find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n5.  **Relate the semi-major axis (`a`) to the given information:**\n    We are given information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the mass of each planet (`M_p`) and the maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`) it induces.\n\n    *   The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K`) by:\n        `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)` where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n\n    *   For a circular orbit viewed edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1, as implied by the transit method), the RV amplitude is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), star's mass (`M_star`), and semi-major axis (`a`):\n        `K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))` where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the semi-major axis (`a`):**\n    Let's rearrange the RV amplitude formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (a * M_star)`\n    `a = (G * M_p^2) / (K^2 * M_star)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the ratio `a2 / a1`:**\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (K1^2 * M_star)]`\n    *   `G` and `M_star` are constants for both planets, so they cancel out.\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n8.  **Express the ratio of RV amplitudes (`K1 / K2`) in terms of the given Doppler shifts (`Δλ`):**\n    `K1 = c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)`\n    `K2 = c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)`\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n9.  **Substitute the `K` ratio back into the `a` ratio:**\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n10. **Substitute the `a2 / a1` expression back into the simplified temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    Taking the square root, we get:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n11. **Plug in the numerical values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet 1, `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2, `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1, `Δλ_1 = 0.03` Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2, `Δλ_2 = 0.04` Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n12. **Calculate the final decimal value:**\n    We can use a short Python script to compute the final value of 15 / 28.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n#\n# M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n# M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n# delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Angstrom\n# delta_lambda2 = 0.04 Angstrom\n\nratio = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is ~0.5357, which is approximately 0.53. This matches option B. Note that much of the information given in the problem (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) is not needed for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>",
