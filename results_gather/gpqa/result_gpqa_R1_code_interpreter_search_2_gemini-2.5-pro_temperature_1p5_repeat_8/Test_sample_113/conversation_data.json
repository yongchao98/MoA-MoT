    "*   **Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n        *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n        *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n        *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate (`-O⁻`) is a base and needs to be protonated by an acid to form the final hydroxyl group (`-OH`) of the cyanohydrin product. Therefore, reagent 'A' must be a proton source (an acid).\n        *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n            *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is typically used for forming crystalline bisulfite addition products for purification, not as a proton source in cyanohydrin formation.\n            *   `H₃O⁺`: Hydronium ion, typically from a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ dissolved in water, is an excellent proton source. It will readily protonate the alkoxide intermediate to yield the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** `A` must be `H₃O⁺`. This narrows down the possible answers to options B and C.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n        *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n        *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This is a classic hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n        *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires either acidic or basic catalysis and the presence of water. The reaction typically proceeds by heating the nitrile with aqueous acid or base.\n        *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent 'B' acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n        *   **Evaluating Options for B (from the remaining choices B and C):**\n            *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. While it can catalyze the reaction, the process would be very slow and often incomplete.\n            *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids when heated in aqueous solution.\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** `B` is `HCl`, a strong acid catalyst.\n\n    3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n        *   Based on the analysis, reagent `A` is `H₃O⁺` and reagent `B` is `HCl`.\n        *   This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
