    "An atomic nucleus of mass M has a rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\nThe nucleus is initially at rest.\nIt undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n\n**1. Determine the rest-masses of the fragments.**\n\nWe are given two conditions:\ni) One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`. This also means their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\nii) The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n\nLet's use the rest-mass energies for calculation (all in GeV). Let `E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`.\n`E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\nAnd we have `E1 = 2 * E2`.\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n`2*E2 + E2 = 297`\n`3*E2 = 297`\n`E2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find E1:\n`E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is 198 GeV, and for the lighter fragment (m2) it is 99 GeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\nThe Q-value is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final total rest-mass energy. This difference in mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = -p2`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSo, `T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = Q`\n`T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the correct (relativistic) formula.**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is `E_total = T + m*c^2`. The energy-momentum relation is `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nConservation of momentum still requires `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`(E_total,1)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (E_total,2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nConservation of total energy states that the total energy of the final fragments must equal the initial rest energy of the nucleus (since it was at rest).\n`E_total,1 + E_total,2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\nSo, `E_total,2 = 300 - E_total,1`.\n\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n`(E_total,1)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (300 - E_total,1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E_total,1)^2 - (198)^2 = 300^2 - 600*E_total,1 + (E_total,1)^2 - (99)^2`\n\nCancel `(E_total,1)^2` from both sides:\n`- (198)^2 = 300^2 - 600*E_total,1 - (99)^2`\n`600 * E_total,1 = 300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2`\n`600 * E_total,1 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801`\n`600 * E_total,1 = 119403`\n`E_total,1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n`T1_rel = E_total,1 - m1*c^2`\n`T1_rel = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**5. Find the difference.**\n\nThe difference is `T1_rel - T1_cl`.\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nWe can use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Sum of rest-mass energies of the two fragments\nsum_m_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2\n\n# Given m1 = 2 * m2, so m1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\n# We have m1_c2 + m2_c2 = sum_m_c2\n# This gives 3 * m2_c2 = sum_m_c2\nm2_c2 = sum_m_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2 # This is the more massive fragment\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nQ = M_c2 - sum_m_c2\n\n# --- Classical Calculation of T1 ---\n# T1_cl = Q * (m2 / (m1 + m2)) = Q * (m2_c2 / (m1_c2 + m2_c2))\n# Or simply, T1_cl = Q / 3\nT1_cl_GeV = Q / 3.0\nT1_cl_MeV = T1_cl_GeV * 1000\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation of T1 ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive:\n# E_tot_1 = (M_c2^2 + m1_c2^2 - m2_c2^2) / (2 * M_c2)\nE_tot_1_GeV = (M_c2**2 + m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest-mass energy\n# T1_rel = E_tot_1 - m1_c2\nT1_rel_GeV = E_tot_1_GeV - m1_c2\nT1_rel_MeV = T1_rel_GeV * 1000\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference_MeV = T1_rel_MeV - T1_cl_MeV\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.00\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Define initial state and fragment properties**\n\n*   **Initial nucleus:**\n    *   Rest mass: M\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial state: At rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0` and total initial energy is `E_initial = E_M = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final fragments:**\n    *   Rest masses: m1 and m2\n    *   Rest-mass energies: `E1 = m1*c^2` and `E2 = m2*c^2`\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`, which implies `E1 = 2 * E2`.\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * E_M`.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments**\n\n*   `E1 + E2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Substitute `E1 = 2 * E2` into the equation above:\n    `2*E2 + E2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3*E2 = 297 GeV`\n    `E2 = 99 GeV`\n*   Now, find `E1`:\n    `E1 = 2 * E2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   So, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E1 = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` of the two fragments comes from the conversion of the \"missing\" rest mass.\n`Q = E_initial - (E1 + E2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must also be zero. The fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n    `p1 = p2 = p`\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T_cl = p^2 / (2m)`\n*   We can write the kinetic energies of the fragments as:\n    `T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    `T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n    So, `T1_cl = (1/2) * T2_cl`.\n*   Now we use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate the correct T1 using relativistic mechanics**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E_total^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This means `(p*c)^2 = E_total^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal:\n    `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    `(E_total,1)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (E_total,2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system is conserved.\n    `E_total,1 + E_total,2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`\n    So, `E_total,2 = 300 - E_total,1`.\n*   Substitute `E_total,2` and the rest-mass energies (`E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`) into the momentum equation:\n    `(E_total,1)^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_total,1)^2 - (99)^2`\n*   Expand the right side:\n    `(E_total,1)^2 - 39204 = (300^2 - 2*300*E_total,1 + (E_total,1)^2) - 9801`\n    `(E_total,1)^2 - 39204 = 90000 - 600*E_total,1 + (E_total,1)^2 - 9801`\n*   Cancel `(E_total,1)^2` from both sides and solve for `E_total,1`:\n    `-39204 = 90000 - 9801 - 600*E_total,1`\n    `600*E_total,1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204`\n    `600*E_total,1 = 119403`\n    `E_total,1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n*   The relativistic kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    `T1_rel = E_total,1 - m1*c^2`\n    `T1_rel = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the difference**\n\n*   `Difference = T1_rel - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classically calculated one is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
