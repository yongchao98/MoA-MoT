    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy**\n\n*   **System:** We have three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   **Spin Values:** Each spin can be either +1 or -1.\n*   **Total States:** With 3 spins and 2 possibilities for each, there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations (states) for the system.\n*   **Energy Equation:** The energy of any given state is E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum over all possible states (s) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE(s)), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states exp(-βE)\n\nTo calculate this, we need to find the energy E for each of the 8 states. A more efficient way is to find the distinct energy levels and how many states correspond to each energy level (the degeneracy).\n\n**3. List All States and Calculate Their Energies**\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states as (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the term K = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. The energy will then be E = -JK.\n\n| State # | (S1, S2, S3) | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | K = S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 | Energy E = -JK |\n| :---: | :----------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :----------------: | :------------: |\n| 1     | (+1, +1, +1) | +1   | +1   | +1   | +3                 | -3J            |\n| 2     | (+1, +1, -1) | +1   | -1   | -1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 3     | (+1, -1, +1) | -1   | +1   | -1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 4     | (-1, +1, +1) | -1   | -1   | +1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 5     | (+1, -1, -1) | -1   | -1   | +1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 6     | (-1, +1, -1) | -1   | +1   | -1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 7     | (-1, -1, +1) | +1   | -1   | -1   | -1                 | J              |\n| 8     | (-1, -1, -1) | +1   | +1   | +1   | +3                 | -3J            |\n\n**4. Group States by Energy Level (Find Degeneracy)**\n\nBy examining the table, we can see there are only two distinct energy values:\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This occurs when all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n    States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = J:**\n    This occurs for all other states where one spin is different from the other two.\n    States: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), (-1,-1,+1).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g₂ = 6.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write the partition function Z using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * exp(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
