    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Structure from the Given Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contribute a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: The other substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I), which we can represent as -X. A halogen atom contains 0 carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the Identity of the Substituents:**\n    *   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and another group.\n    *   Since the halogen contributes 0 carbons, the second substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider the possible structures for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This group also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   So, the unknown compound is likely either a halo-substituted acetophenone (Structure I) or a halo-substituted phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectral Options:**\n    *   The question provides four possible 1H NMR spectra. We must find the one that matches one of our proposed structures.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Options A and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substituted** benzene ring. This suggests the two substituents are opposite each other on the ring.\n    *   **Non-Aromatic (Aliphatic) Region:** This is where we will distinguish between the possibilities.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Plausible Option:**\n\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum corresponds to Structure II, p-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: The chemical shift is perfect for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: The chemical shift is reasonable for a CH2 group next to an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n        *   **Inconsistency Check:** The protons of the -CH2-CHO group are adjacent. They should couple with each other. The CH2 signal should be a **doublet** (split by the one CHO proton), and the CHO signal should be a **triplet** (split by the two CH2 protons). The spectrum incorrectly lists both as **singlets (s)**. This indicates that option A describes an incorrect or impossible spectrum for the proposed structure.\n\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum corresponds to Structure I, p-haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl. The chemical shift is appropriate.\n        *   **Consistency Check:** The three protons of this methyl group have no adjacent protons to couple with, so their signal should correctly be a **singlet (s)**. This is consistent with the provided data. The integration (3H) is also correct.\n\n    *   **Options B and C:** These can be quickly dismissed as they lack the characteristic signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring in the 7-8 ppm range.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The compound is a p-haloacetophenone. Its structure is consistent with all the information given (C8, di-substituted aromatic, C=O, Ar-X).\n    *   The 1H NMR data in option D perfectly matches the expected spectrum for this compound: a para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets) and a methyl ketone singlet.\n    *   The data in option A contains a fundamental inconsistency in the signal multiplicities for the aliphatic portion.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
