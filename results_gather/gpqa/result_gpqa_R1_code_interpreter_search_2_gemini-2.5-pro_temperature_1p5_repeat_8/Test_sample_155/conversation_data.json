    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide.\n    *   A trans-alkene will form a trans-epoxide.\n    *   The mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attack from the bottom produces the other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture** of the trans-epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an **anti-addition**. The water molecule (nucleophile) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Attack by water at C5 inverts the configuration at C5 from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C4 would yield (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is the same molecule due to symmetry. This product is a **meso compound** because it has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Similarly, hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   A general rule: The anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   A cis-alkene will form a cis-epoxide.\n    *   The cis-epoxide of oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry passing through the oxygen atom and bisecting the C-C bond.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a single **meso compound**: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring opening with H₂O.** This is an anti-addition.\n    *   We start with the meso-epoxide. Attack by water can occur at C4 or C5.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is, say, R) inverts its configuration to S. The other center (C5, which is S) is not affected. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R. The other center (C4, which is R) is not affected. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n    *   A general rule: The anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of compounds 2 and 3. Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (like compound 1 vs. the pair of 2 and 3) have different physical properties and will be separated. Compound 1 will elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   Total Peaks = 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two. It will also be separated, eluting as its own **single peak**.\n    *   Total Peaks = 1 (for the R,R enantiomer) + 1 (for the S,S enantiomer) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
