    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and the subsequent products.**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6):** The molecular formula corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane. The reaction with Br2 in CCl4 is a classic test for unsaturation, strongly suggesting an alkene. The only possible alkene with this formula is propene (CH3-CH=CH2).\n    *   A = Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)\n\n*   **Compound B:** Propene undergoes electrophilic addition with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each carbon of the former double bond.\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   B = 1,2-dibromopropane\n\n*   **Compound C:** Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This reagent is used for dehydrohalogenation (elimination of HBr). Since it's a vicinal dihalide, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    *   Reaction: CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 alc. KOH --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   C = Propyne\n\n*   **Compound D:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes to form an aromatic ring. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize. To minimize steric hindrance, they will arrange symmetrically.\n    *   Reaction: 3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    *   D = 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (also known as Mesitylene)\n\n*   **Compound E:** Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is the standard condition for nitration, using concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The methyl groups (-CH3) are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In Mesitylene, all three available positions (2, 4, 6) are activated and equivalent.\n    *   Reaction: Mesitylene + conc. HNO3 / conc. H2SO4 --> 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene\n    *   E = 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene\n\n*   **Compound F:** Compound E (2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2,4,6-trimethylaniline\n    *   F = 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as Mesidine)\n\n*   **Compound G:** Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically made in situ from NaNO2/HCl at 0-5°C). This is the diazotization reaction.\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylaniline + HNO2 --> 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n    *   G = 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n\n*   **Compound H:** Compound G (the diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming a diazonium salt with water or a basic solution causes it to hydrolyze, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol.\n    *   Reaction: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O/OH- --(warm)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol\n    *   H = 2,4,6-trimethylphenol\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the given statements.**\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines like aniline and its derivatives are fundamental starting materials for the production of a large class of dyes, particularly azo dyes (via their diazonium salts). This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, which means it is a gas at standard room temperature (approx. 25 °C). As a small hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the threefold rotational symmetry of the molecule:\n        1.  All nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons to couple with, this signal will be a singlet (9H).\n        2.  All three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent. They will produce a second signal, which will also be a singlet (3H).\n    *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of D will show two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenol complex.\n    *   However, phenols with bulky substituent groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the -OH group) are sterically hindered. In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two ortho-methyl groups prevent the formation of the large colored complex with the Fe3+ ion.\n    *   Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a **negative** ferric chloride test, meaning no characteristic color change occurs. The statement that it gives a yellow color is **incorrect**. The yellow color of the FeCl3 solution itself does not constitute a positive test result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and C are correct descriptions of the respective compounds. Statement D is incorrect because the sterically hindered phenol H does not give a positive ferric chloride test.\n\n<<<D>>>"
