    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is built around a C=C double bond. All atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C, C, C) lie in a single plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The important part of the name for this question is the stereochemical descriptor `(3aR,7aS,E)`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC naming convention uses descriptors like (R), (S), (E), (Z) to specify a unique stereoisomer. The presence of absolute configuration descriptors like (R) and (S) in the name, referring to chiral centers within the molecule, explicitly indicates that the molecule is chiral and that this name refers to a specific enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is named, it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups at one end are identical to the groups at the other end (HOOC-CH(CH₃)-). When a molecule has two stereocenters and the substituents on both centers are the same, the isomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is a meso compound. A meso compound has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule between the two stereocenters.\n        In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The (2R,3R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral and therefore optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes the stereodescriptor `(R)`, which specifies the absolute configuration at a chiral center. C1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₂-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH₂-. The molecule as a whole lacks any planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and the name refers to a specific enantiomer, which is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) usually implies that all substituents have the same orientation relative to the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** In the all-cis configuration (all -OH groups pointing \"up\" or all \"down\"), the molecule possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σᵥ). The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Other possible stereoisomers (e.g., one OH trans to the other two) also possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for chirality.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** Let's examine the carbon atoms. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, two methyl groups (`-CH₃`), and the `-CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n        *   **Overall Symmetry:** While many conformations of this flexible molecule are asymmetric, a molecule is achiral if it can adopt any conformation that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This molecule can adopt a conformation where a plane of symmetry passes through the C=O group, the C1-C2-C3 backbone, and the hydrogen on C3, with the two methyl groups on C3 reflected across this plane. Because such a symmetric conformation is accessible through free bond rotation, the molecule is achiral on the whole.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically Inactive:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
