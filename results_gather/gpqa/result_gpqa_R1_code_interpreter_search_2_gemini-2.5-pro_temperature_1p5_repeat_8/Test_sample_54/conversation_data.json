    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's dissect each signal provided:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high value suggests the proton is on a carbon atom attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like an oxygen atom.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to (adjacent to) only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for vinylic protons. J values in the range of 12-18 Hz are characteristic of a *trans* relationship across the double bond. A *cis* relationship would have a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'd' (doublet) means it's coupled to one proton. The 'q' (quartet) means it's coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (like a methyl group, CH3).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is very characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH3).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This fits the acetate methyl group structure.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic/vinylic methyl region.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning the methyl group is attached to a carbon that has one proton (a -CH- group).\n\n**2. Assemble the Pieces and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can deduce the following structural fragments:\n*   An acetate group: **-O-C(=O)-CH3** (from the 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet).\n*   A *trans* double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the two vinylic signals, one at 7.0 ppm and one at 5.5 ppm, with J = 16.0 Hz).\n*   A methyl group attached to the double bond: **CH3-CH=** (from the 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet, which is coupled to one of the vinylic protons).\n\nLet's combine these fragments. The structure must be **CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3**. This corresponds to propenyl acetate.\n\nNow we can compare this with the given options:\n\n*   **A) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This would have the correct signals and splitting, but the coupling constant between the vinylic protons would be small (~6-12 Hz), not the observed 16.0 Hz. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) Trans-butenyl acetate & C) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-Ac or CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-Ac) would have a different number of protons and different splitting patterns. For instance, but-1-enyl acetate would show signals for an ethyl group (a triplet and a quartet), which are not present. But-2-enyl acetate would have a methylene (-CH2-) group signal. The given data with a total of 1H+1H+3H+3H = 8 protons fits a propenyl acetate (C5H8O2), not a butenyl acetate (C6H10O2). So, both butenyl options are incorrect.\n*   **D) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Let's verify this structure against the data one last time.\n    *   Structure: CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)\n    *   **Protons (d):** The acetate methyl group. Appears as a singlet at ~2.1 ppm. -> Matches **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n    *   **Protons (a):** The vinylic methyl group. It is coupled to proton (b), so it's a doublet. -> Matches **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n    *   **Proton (c):** The vinylic proton next to the oxygen. It is deshielded by the oxygen, making it appear far downfield. It's coupled only to proton (b), so it's a doublet with a *trans* coupling constant. -> Matches **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n    *   **Proton (b):** The other vinylic proton. It's coupled to proton (c) (making a doublet) and the three protons of methyl group (a) (making a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets. -> Matches **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n\nThe structure of Trans-propenyl acetate is a perfect match for all the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
