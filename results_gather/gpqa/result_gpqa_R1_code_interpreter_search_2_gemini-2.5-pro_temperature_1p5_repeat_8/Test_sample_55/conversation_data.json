    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process involving two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   **Change in principal quantum number n:**  $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since it's a decay (emission process), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease at each step.\n*   **Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number l:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in magnetic quantum number m:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Intermediate State\n\nLet's apply the selection rules for the first transition from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **l-selection rule:** The initial state has $l=0$. For a dipole transition, $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l' = l+1 = 1$.\n*   **n-selection rule:** The energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$. A possible value is $n'=2$. The other option is $n'=1$, but for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is possible, which would violate the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule. So the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **m-selection rule:** The initial state has $m=0$. For a dipole transition, $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. So the intermediate state can have $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Second Transition\n\nNow let's check the transition from the possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **l-selection rule:** The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is an allowed dipole transition.\n*   **m-selection rule:** The final state has $m_f=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = -m'$.\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=+1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n\nAll three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the three possible routes for the two-dipole transition are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratios of the transitions.\n\nThe total probability of the cascade $|i\\rangle \\to |j\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is given by the product of the branching ratio for the first step and the branching ratio for the second step:\n$P(\\text{route } j) = \\text{BR}(i \\to j) \\times \\text{BR}(j \\to f)$.\n\n*   **Second step:** The intermediate states are $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p states). According to the selection rules, the only lower-energy state they can decay to via dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state). Therefore, the transition from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ occurs with 100% probability. So, $\\text{BR}(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **First step:** The probability of a specific route is thus determined entirely by the branching ratio of the first transition: $P(\\text{route } j) = \\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$. The branching ratio is the rate of the specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma$ for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nWe need to calculate the rates for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for $m'=-1, 0, 1$. The three destination states are degenerate in energy (in the non-relativistic theory), so the frequency factor $\\omega^3$ in the full rate formula is the same for all three transitions. The radial part of the integral, $\\int R_{2,1}^*(r) R_{3,0}(r) r^3 dr$, is also the same for all three. Therefore, we only need to compare the angular parts of the matrix elements.\n\nA detailed calculation using either explicit spherical harmonics or the Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that the transition rates are equal for all three final states:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total decay rate of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of these rates, as this is the only allowed dipole decay channel:\n$\\Gamma_{\\text{total}} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe branching ratio for the transition to any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n$\\text{BR}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability for each of the three possible routes is $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability, there is a typo in the question for this option)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\nBased on the calculation, the probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
