    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (A) with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (B)**\n\n*   **Reactant A**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative. It has two double bonds (C2=C3 and C5=C6) which can act as dienophiles in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reactant B**: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a substituted cyclohexadiene. The C1-C2-C3-C4 part of the molecule is a conjugated diene system, which can participate in a Diels-Alder reaction. The two `CHBr2` groups are substituents at the C5 and C6 positions.\n*   **Reaction**: The most plausible reaction between a diene (B) and a dienophile (A) is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction). Since reactant A has two dienophilic double bonds and 2 equivalents of reactant B are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction will occur. One molecule of B reacts with the C2=C3 double bond of A, and a second molecule of B reacts with the C5=C6 double bond of A.\n*   **Product 1**: This will be a large, complex polycyclic molecule. It retains the 7-(tert-butoxy) group from A and incorporates two units from B, meaning it will have a total of four `-CHBr2` groups.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Aqueous acid serves two purposes here.\n    1.  **Cleavage of the tert-butyl ether**: The acid catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 7-(tert-butoxy) group to a secondary hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard deprotection reaction for t-butyl ethers.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis of gem-dibromides**: The four `-CHBr2` groups are geminal dihalides. In the presence of aqueous acid and heat, these groups hydrolyze to form aldehyde groups (`-CHO`).\n*   **Product 2**: This molecule has the same carbon skeleton as Product 1, but the -O-tBu group has become an -OH group, and the four `-CHBr2` groups have become four `-CHO` groups. So, Product 2 is a polycyclic secondary alcohol with four aldehyde functional groups.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO**\n\n*   **Reaction**: This set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild and selective oxidizing agent for primary and secondary alcohols.\n*   **Selectivity**: The Parikh-Doering oxidation will oxidize the secondary alcohol at the C7 position to a ketone (`C=O`). It is generally not strong enough to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic acids under these conditions, especially when a more easily oxidized alcohol is present.\n*   **Product 3**: The resulting molecule is a polycyclic ketone that also contains four aldehyde groups.\n\n**Step 4: Heating Product 3 at 150°C**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Heating a molecule like Product 3, which was formed via a Diels-Alder reaction, often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction is entropically favored at higher temperatures and breaks the molecule back down into its constituent diene and dienophile fragments.\n*   **Fragmentation**: Product 3 will break down into one dienophile-derived fragment and two diene-derived fragments.\n    *   **Dienophile fragment**: This comes from the central norbornadiene core of A. After the preceding steps, it is **7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene** (norbornadien-7-one). This molecule is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to extrude carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene**.\n    *   **Diene fragments**: These come from the two molecules of B that were added. After the hydrolysis step, the `-CHBr2` groups have become `-CHO` groups. Therefore, the diene fragment released is **5,6-diformylcyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n*   **Final Product 4**: The question asks for the final product, 4. While benzene and CO are also formed, 5,6-diformylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is the major, more complex organic product derived from reactant B. So, **Product 4 is 5,6-diformylcyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\n*   **Structure**: Product 4 is 5,6-diformylcyclohexa-1,3-diene. It consists of a cyclohexadiene ring with aldehyde groups (-CHO) attached to C5 and C6.\n    ```\n          H   H\n          | / |\n         C===C\n        /     \\\n      H-C       C-H\n        |       |\n     H--C-------C--H\n        |       |\n       O=CH   HC=O\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule possesses symmetry. The C5 and C6 carbons are stereocenters.\n    *   If the two CHO groups are on the same side (cis-isomer), the molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   If the two CHO groups are on opposite sides (trans-isomer), the molecule has a C2 axis of rotation.\n    In either case, the symmetry makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Environments**: We can group the hydrogen atoms into sets of chemically equivalent protons based on this symmetry.\n    1.  The two vinyl hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the sp³ carbons (H on C1 and H on C4) are equivalent.\n    2.  The two vinyl hydrogens in the middle of the diene system (H on C2 and H on C3) are equivalent to each other.\n    3.  The two methine hydrogens on the carbons bearing the aldehyde groups (H on C5 and H on C6) are equivalent.\n    4.  The two hydrogens of the aldehyde groups (-CHO) are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
