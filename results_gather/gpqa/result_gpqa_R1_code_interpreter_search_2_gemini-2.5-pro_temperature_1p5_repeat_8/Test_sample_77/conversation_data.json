    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. Defining the Framework\n\n*   A point charge `q` moves along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   Its velocity at any time `t` is `v(t) = d s(t) / dt`.\n*   We want to find the potentials `V` and `A` at an observation point `r` at time `t`.\n*   Electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the fields observed at `(r, t)` are caused by the charge's state at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` must be `t - tr`.\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. Defining the Key Vectors\n\nLet's clarify the vectors used in the problem statement and the derivation:\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v = v(tr)`: The velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `d`: The vector from the source's retarded position to the observation point.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   `d = |d|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled.\n\nUsing this notation, the retarded time condition is:\n`c(t - tr) = d`\n\n### 3. Starting from Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are the retarded potentials, which for continuous distributions `ρ` and `J` are:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))` (δ³ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function)\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Potential Integrals\n\nSubstituting the point charge density into the integral for `V(r, t)`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr'))] / |r - r'| d³r'`\nwhere `tr'` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`, i.e., `tr' = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nThis integral is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function `s(tr')` depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, though somewhat complex, result from electromagnetism theory shows how to evaluate this integral. The effect of the retarded time in the delta function introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (|r - s(tr)| * (1 - v(tr) · (r - s(tr))) / (c * |r - s(tr)|))]`\nAll terms in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr` corresponding to the observation point `r`.\n\nLet's simplify this using our defined vectors `d = r - s(tr)` and `v = v(tr)`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d * (1 - v · d / (cd)))]`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - v · d / c)]`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc) / (dc - v · d)`\n\nNow for the vector potential `A`. The process is identical. We can simply note that `J = ρv`. Since `v(tr)` is a constant with respect to the spatial integration, we find:\n`A(r, t) = v(tr) / c² * V(r, t)`\nThis is a general relation between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nSubstituting our expression for `V(r, t)`:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * [(1 / 4πε₀) * (qc) / (dc - v · d)]`\n`A(r, t) = (q * v) / (4πε₀c * (dc - v · d))`\n\nUsing the relation `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, we can write `1/(ε₀c) = (μ₀c)`.\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀c * q * v) / (4π * (dc - v · d))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀qc * v) / (4π(dc - v · d))`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**: This uses the instantaneous distance `r` and ignores the retardation effect in the denominator. Incorrect.\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**: This matches our derived expressions for both `V` and `A`.\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**: The expression for `V` is incorrect. The expression for `A` is dimensionally incorrect (`v²` is a scalar).\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**: The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. This is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the apparent volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\nThe correct expressions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
