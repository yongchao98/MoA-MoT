    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon (a spin-1/2 particle). These components are defined in terms of 2x2 matrices and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are, in fact, the spin angular momentum operators, where the matrices are the well-known Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$). So, $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n**2. Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe problem states that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nFor the vector to lie in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This requires $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which means $\\phi = 0$ (or $\\pi$). By convention, we'll choose $\\phi=0$. The angle $\\theta$ represents the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\nThus, the unit vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the operator $P_n$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator representing the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n$P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operators:\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\nWe can factor out $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ and combine the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCancel $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of linear equations:\n1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, let's find the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nThis tells us that $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. So, the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**5. Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nA quantum state vector must be normalized, meaning its inner product with itself is 1. For $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, the normalization condition is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\nSubstitute $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$:\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nTaking the square root, we get $|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$. By convention, the overall phase of the eigenvector is chosen to make the first component real and positive. So we choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\nNow, we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Comparing this with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
