    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two physical scenarios that produce a similar change in observed brightness from a star:\n    *   **Scenario 1: A rotating star with spots.** One hemisphere is \"clean\" with a uniform temperature ($T_{eff}$), and the other hemisphere is partially covered with cooler, dark spots. As the star rotates, we see either the clean face (maximum brightness) or the spotty face (minimum brightness).\n    *   **Scenario 2: An exoplanet transit.** A planet passes in front of an unspotted star, blocking a fraction of its light and causing a dip in brightness.\n\n    The goal is to find the size of the exoplanet (relative to the star, $R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause a brightness dip of the same magnitude as the one caused by the rotating spotted star.\n\n2.  **Model the Brightness Variation from Spots:**\n    *   The brightness (or flux, F) of a star is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ($F \\propto T^4$).\n    *   Let's denote the star's effective temperature as $T_{eff} = 6000$ K.\n    *   The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is $T_{spot} = 6000 - 1000 = 5000$ K.\n    *   The \"filling factor\" of spots on the dark hemisphere is $f = 20\\% = 0.2$. This means 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% is at the normal temperature $T_{eff}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Maximum and Minimum Brightness:**\n    *   **Maximum Brightness ($B_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature of $T_{eff}$. The total brightness is proportional to the flux from the star's disk area ($A_{disk}$):\n        $B_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4$ (where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant).\n\n    *   **Minimum Brightness ($B_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. Now, the visible disk is a composite: 80% of its area has a temperature of $T_{eff}$ and 20% has a temperature of $T_{spot}$.\n        The brightness is the sum of contributions from the spotted and unspotted parts:\n        $B_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{spot}^4]$\n\n4.  **Calculate the \"Amplitude Signal\" from the Spots:**\n    *   The \"amplitude signal\" in this context refers to the fractional drop in brightness, which is analogous to a transit depth. It's the difference between maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the maximum brightness.\n    *   Signal Amplitude = $\\frac{B_{max} - B_{min}}{B_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}}$\n    *   Let's substitute the expressions from step 3. The terms $A_{disk}$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out.\n        $\\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}} = \\frac{(1-f)T_{eff}^4 + fT_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} = (1-f) + f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n    *   Therefore, the signal amplitude is:\n        Signal Amplitude = $1 - \\left[ (1-f) + f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right] = f - f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 = f \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n\n5.  **Model the Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits, it blocks an area of the star's disk equal to its own disk area ($\\pi R_{pl}^2$).\n    *   The fractional drop in brightness, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area (assuming a simple model without limb darkening).\n    *   Transit Depth = $\\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:**\n    *   The problem requires the signal from the spots to be equal to the signal from the transit.\n        $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n    *   Now, I will plug in the numerical values and compute the result using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation of spots.\n# This is the fractional brightness drop, equivalent to a transit depth.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nsignal_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of a planet is given by (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set the signal amplitude equal to the transit depth.\n# (R_pl_over_R_star)**2 = signal_amplitude\n# Therefore, R_pl_over_R_star = sqrt(signal_amplitude)\nR_pl_over_R_star = math.sqrt(signal_amplitude)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(R_pl_over_R_star)\n```\n\n> **Execution Output:**\n>\n> 0.3217904586547144\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value `~0.32` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (relative to its star, $R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same brightness drop as a rotating star with one spotted hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spotted Star Scenario:**\n    *   The brightness of a star (or a part of it) is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($Flux \\propto T^4$).\n    *   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible surface has a temperature of $T_{eff} = 6000$ K. So, $F_{max} \\propto T_{eff}^4$.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor ($f$) of 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of the surface area has the spot temperature ($T_{spot}$), and the remaining 80% (or 1-$f$) has the normal effective temperature ($T_{eff}$).\n    *   The spot temperature is $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K$.\n    *   The flux from this spotted face is a weighted average: $F_{min} \\propto (1-f) \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot T_{spot}^4$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fractional Brightness Drop from Spots:**\n    *   The amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the fractional drop, is calculated as $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n    *   Signal from spots = $1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{(1-f)T_{eff}^4 + fT_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        Signal from spots = $1 - \\left( (1-f) + f \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} \\right) = 1 - 1 + f - f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 = f \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario:**\n    *   When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the starlight.\n    *   The fractional drop in brightness (the \"transit depth\") is the ratio of the planet's projected area ($\\pi R_{pl}^2$) to the star's projected area ($\\pi R_{star}^2$).\n    *   Signal from planet = $\\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the two signals must be equal.\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = f \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]$\n    *   To find the relative radius $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$, we take the square root of both sides.\n    *   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{f \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right]}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Substitute the given values into the equation:\n        $f = 0.2$\n        $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n        $T_{spot} = 5000$ K\n    *   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.2 \\times \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right]}$\n    *   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.2 \\times \\left[1 - (5/6)^4\\right]}$\n    *   The calculation performed by the Python script gives the result: $\\approx 0.3218$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
