    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4. The benzene ring itself accounts for a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the functional groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR:** The spectrum shows \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information. For the ester R-COO-R', if the R' group were ethyl (-CH2CH3) or any longer alkyl chain, it would produce a -CH2- signal. The absence of such a signal strongly indicates that R' is a methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, we have a methyl ester group, **-COOCH3**. This fragment contributes two carbons (C2), two oxygens (O2), and three hydrogens (H3) to the formula. It also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned in the problem (this one would be a singlet).\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining fragments from NMR:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum has two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond). This tells us there is a `-CH=CH-` group, which adds another degree of unsaturation. So, the total DoU is now 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n    *   **Coupling patterns of Vinyl-H:** One vinyl-H is a **doublet (d)**, meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**, meaning it is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This specific `d` and `dq` pattern for two adjacent vinyl protons is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the rest of the molecule.\n        *   Let's label the structure: (Ring)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet (d).\n        *   H(b) is coupled to H(a) (making it a doublet) and the -CH3 group (making it a quartet). The combined pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-CH3** fragment. This fragment contributes three carbons (C3) and five hydrogens (H5) to the formula.\n\n4.  **Confirm the -CH3 signals:** The problem states there are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n    *   Signal 1: From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This methyl group is adjacent to an oxygen and has no neighboring protons, so it appears as a singlet.\n    *   Signal 2: From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to the CH(b) vinyl proton, so it will be split into a doublet.\n    *   The presence of two distinct methyl signals is perfectly consistent with our deduced fragments.\n\n5.  **Assemble the molecular formula:** Now we combine all the identified pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**, which has the formula **C2O2H3** when considered as a substituent.\n    *   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has the formula **C3H5** when considered as a substituent.\n\n    Summing the atoms from these parts:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with options:**\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C11H14O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. Let's quickly check why the others are incorrect.\n    *   C11H14O2 (DoU=5): Would not have the C=C double bond (no vinyl protons). Incorrect.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DoU=6): Has one C and two H more than our structure. This implies an extra CH2 group (e.g., an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3), but the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals. Incorrect.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DoU=7): Has an extra degree of unsaturation (e.g., another ring or double bond) which is not supported by the simple fragments identified from the NMR. Incorrect.\n\nThe only formula consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
