    "*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the α-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two environments must belong to two different, but structurally very similar, chemical species. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals means these two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) result, showing two distinct peaks, confirms the presence of two different species that can be physically separated. The mass spectrometry (MS) result, showing that both peaks have the identical mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule, proves that these two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass). The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The fact that the peaks are still resolved at elevated temperatures suggests that they are stable isomers, not conformers that would rapidly interconvert and coalesce into a single peak at higher temperatures.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) are not distinguishable by standard NMR or standard LC unless a chiral environment (like a chiral solvent, chiral shift reagent, or chiral column) is used. Since no such special conditions are mentioned, this is incorrect. Enantiomers would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC.\n    *   **B) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are distinct chemical compounds. Therefore, they are expected to have different NMR spectra (giving two sets of peaks) and to be separable by standard LC (giving two peaks). As isomers, they would have the same mass. This scenario perfectly matches all the experimental observations. Diastereomers can be formed during peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid centers epimerizes (e.g., an L-amino acid converts to a D-amino acid), creating a diastereomeric peptide (e.g., L-L vs. D-L). Another possibility in peptides is the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers around an amide bond, which are also a form of diastereomer (specifically, atropisomers). Both epimerization and cis-trans isomerism are common phenomena in synthesized peptides.\n    *   **C) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data explicitly shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product, ruling this out.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' product:** A side product from a \"double coupling\" reaction would involve the addition of extra atoms (e.g., another amino acid), resulting in a significantly different mass. Again, the MS data contradicts this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the crude product is a mixture of two diastereomers in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>"
