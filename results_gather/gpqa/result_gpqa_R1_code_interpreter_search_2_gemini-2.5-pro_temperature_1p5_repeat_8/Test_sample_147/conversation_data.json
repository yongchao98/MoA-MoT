    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    We are given that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFx.\n    The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is ~19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for the mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We need to find an element Y with molar mass M(Y) that is approximately 40.45 times an integer `x` (the number of fluorine atoms, representing the oxidation state). The element Y must also be known to form at least five different binary fluorides. Let's test plausible candidates:\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** M(Pt) ≈ 195.1 g/mol. `x` = 195.1 / 40.45 ≈ 4.8. Let's test x=5. A2 = PtF5.\n        M(PtF5) = 195.1 + 5 * 19.0 = 290.1 g/mol.\n        ɷF(PtF5) = (5 * 19.0) / 290.1 * 100% = 32.7%. This is close to 31.96%.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol. `x` = 244 / 40.45 ≈ 6.0. Let's test x=6. A2 = PuF6.\n        M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19.0 = 358 g/mol.\n        ɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19.0) / 358 * 100% = 31.84%. This is a very good match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Other Clues to Confirm Y.**\n    *   **Five binary fluorides:** Platinum forms PtF4, PtF5, and PtF6. This is three, not five. Plutonium is known to form PuF3, PuF4, PuF4.5, PuF5, and PuF6. This fits the condition.\n    *   **Strong Oxidizing Agent:** \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon.\" PuF6 is an extremely strong oxidizing agent, one of the few compounds known to oxidize xenon. This strongly supports Y being Plutonium. A1 and A3 must be high-oxidation-state fluorides.\n    *   **Decomposition:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine.\" Based on our finding, A2 is PuF6. The reaction is A1 -> PuF6 + F2. This would imply A1 is a higher fluoride, like PuF8. While PuF8 is not a known stable compound, in the context of a chemistry problem, its transient existence as a highly reactive species is plausible. Alternatively, there might be a slight imprecision in the problem statement, and the reaction could be the known decomposition PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2, but this contradicts the mass percentage data for A2. We will proceed with Y=Pu and A2=PuF6, as this has the strongest support. PuF6 is described as a red-brown solid, which is consistent with \"bright-red\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Five Plutonium Fluorides (A1 to A5).**\n    Given Y=Pu, we need to assign the five fluorides to A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.\n    *   **A2:** PuF6 (from mass percentage calculation).\n    *   **A1:** Decomposes to PuF6 + F2, so it's a higher fluoride. A1 = PuF8 (hypothetically).\n    *   **A3:** Also reacts with xenon, so it must be a strong oxidizer. PuF6 is already assigned to A2. PuF5 is another possibility, or perhaps the problem implies A3 is also PuF6, produced via a different route (\"fluorination of element Y with fluorine\": Pu + 3F2 -> PuF6). For the purpose of identifying A4, the exact identity of A3 is not critical as long as it's one of the five.\n    *   The five known binary fluorides are PuF3, PuF4, PuF4.5 (or Pu2F9), PuF5, PuF6. Our list is {A1(PuF8?), A2(PuF6), A3, A4, A5}. Let's assume the set of five compounds are the most common ones: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, and one other (e.g., Pu2F9 or the hypothetical PuF8 as A1).\n    *   **A4:** The remaining clue is: \"By adding Y (Plutonium) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in a higher oxidation state (in A4) reacts with the pure element (oxidation state 0) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    The reaction is: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n    Let's check possibilities among the known plutonium fluorides (PuFx):\n        *   Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuFx? This is not a standard, clean reaction.\n        *   Pu + PuF4 -> ??? (No simple comproportionation to PuF3, as stoichiometry would be 2Pu + PuF3)\n    Let's re-examine the clue. The problem mentions a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". While fluorides can be dissolved in certain solvents like HF, another interpretation, common in such problems, is that A4 is an acid form of the fluoride in water. Plutonyl fluoride, PuO2F2, forms from the hydrolysis of PuF6.\n    PuF6 + 2H2O -> PuO2F2 + 4HF\n    PuO2F2 forms colorless solutions. Let's assume A4 refers to the aqueous system containing PuO2F2 and HF, where Pu is in the +6 oxidation state.\n\n    The reaction becomes:\n    Pu(0) + A4 (containing Pu(VI)) -> A5 (containing Pu in an intermediate state)\n\n    The most stable lower oxidation state for Pu is +4. A plausible comproportionation reaction involving the element and its +6 state would be:\n    Pu(0) + 2Pu(VI) -> 3Pu(IV)\n\n    In terms of compounds, this would be:\n    Pu + 2PuF6 -> 3PuF4  (This would work in a non-aqueous system)\n    Or, in the aqueous HF system derived from A4 (PuF6):\n    Pu + 2PuO2F2 + 8HF -> 3PuF4 + 4H2O\n\n    In this reaction, the reagent containing Pu(VI) is A4, and the product is PuF4, which would be A5.\n    *   **A4 = PuF6** (the source of the Pu(VI) in the solution).\n    *   **A5 = PuF4**.\n    Let's check the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" PuF4 reacts very slowly with water but can hydrolyze, especially at high temperatures, to form plutonium dioxide (PuO2) and hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n    PuF4 + 2H2O -> PuO2 + 4HF\n    This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Plutonium Hexafluoride (PuF6).\n    We calculate its molecular weight.\n    M(Pu) ≈ 244.06 g/mol\n    M(F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight (A4) = M(PuF6) = 244.06 + 6 * 18.998 = 244.06 + 113.988 = **358.048 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (PuF6) is ~358 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the provided ranges (A: 220-240, B: 110-130, C: 160-180, D: 140-160). There appears to be a significant discrepancy between the logical deduction from the chemical properties and the provided options.\n\n    Let's re-read the problem very carefully to see if any misinterpretation occurred.\n    \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    Maybe the comproportionation is different?\n    Let A4 = PuF(x) and A5 = PuF(y).\n    Reaction: Pu + PuF(x) -> 2PuF(y)  (Since the molar ratio is 1:1, it should produce 2 moles of A5)\n    For this to be balanced, x must be 2y.\n    Possible pairs (A4, A5) from {PuF3, PuF4, PuF6}:\n    *   If A4 = PuF6 (x=6), then A5 = PuF3 (y=3). Reaction: Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3.\n    This is a known reaction. So this is a very strong possibility. A5 = PuF3.\n    *   If A4 = PuF4 (x=4), then A5 = PuF2 (y=2). PuF2 is not a stable common fluoride of plutonium.\n    This makes the assignment **A4 = PuF6** and **A5 = PuF3** the most chemically sound interpretation of this clue.\n\n    Let's re-verify everything.\n    - Y = Pu\n    - Five fluorides exist.\n    - A1(e.g., PuF8), A2(PuF6), A3(e.g., PuF5/PuF6) are strong oxidizers.\n    - A4 = PuF6. The solution would be PuF6 in an inert solvent like anhydrous HF, which would be colorless.\n    - A5 = PuF3.\n    - The reaction Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3 occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    - A5 (PuF3) decomposes in water (hydrolyzes). True.\n\n    The identification of A4 = PuF6 seems robust. Its molecular weight is ~358 g/mol. Since this is not an option, there is a fundamental error in the problem statement or the provided choices.\n\n    However, if we are forced to choose from the given options, we must reconsider everything. Is there any other element? The code execution to find other fits for the mass percentage did not yield any better candidates that also form five fluorides and are strong oxidizers. Plutonium remains the only logical choice for Y. Given the conflict, the question is likely flawed. If we must assume one piece of information is incorrect, which one is it? If the mass percentage is wrong, the entire foundation collapses. If the 1:1 ratio clue is interpreted differently, it might lead to another fluoride for A4. But the `Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuF3` is a simple and known reaction that fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. It is difficult to justify choosing any other fluoride for A4.\n\n    Given the insurmountable discrepancy, an answer cannot be determined from the provided information. The calculated molecular weight (358 g/mol) is far outside all ranges."
