    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the reaction sequence**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This set of reagents points towards an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic anhydride can help form an enolizable intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base. The reaction brominates the α-carbon of acetic acid.\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion (Br⁻) in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3)**. This molecule is notable for having an \"active methylene\" group, the -CH2- positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester).\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-proton (which is still acidic) is removed by another molecule of NaH.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide to form a ring. This is a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction. The resulting ring will have 6 atoms (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   Final Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt, i.e., -CO-O-CH2-CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\nAt room temperature, cyclohexane and its derivatives undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure that we consider for NMR purposes.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The time-averaged structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4 (the opposite carbon in the ring), the cyano group, and the C=O and oxygen of the ester group.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are enantiotopic because they are related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous). They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   Total signals from the ethyl group = 2.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-):**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the CH2 groups at C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the CH2 groups at C3 and C5 equivalent. The CH2 group at C4 is unique as it lies on the plane.\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on any given methylene group in the ring (e.g., C2) are not equivalent. One is in an \"axial-like\" environment and the other is in an \"equatorial-like\" environment. They cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation of the molecule. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This results in two distinct signals for the C2/C6 positions: one signal for the two axial-like protons and one signal for the two equatorial-like protons. Total signals from C2/C6 = **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The geminal protons are diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals for the C3/C5 positions. Total signals from C3/C5 = **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4:** This CH2 group is unique. Its two geminal protons are also diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry passes through the carbon atom but does not interchange the two protons. Thus, they are chemically non-equivalent. Total signals from C4 = **2 signals**.\n        *   Total signals from the cyclohexane ring = 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from ring) = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\nThere are 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product 4, which will result in 8 distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
