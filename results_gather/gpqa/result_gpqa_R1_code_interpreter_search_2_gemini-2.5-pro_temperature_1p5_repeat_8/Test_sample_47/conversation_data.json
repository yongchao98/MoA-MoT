    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha-carbons (C2 and C6), so the bromination will occur at one of these positions to form 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n\n*   The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n*   The enolate then undergoes an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate called a cyclopropanone derivative (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n*   The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate. The ring opens to relieve strain, resulting in a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n*   Protonation of this carbanion during acidic workup (implied) yields a carboxylic acid with one fewer carbon in the ring. The original six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n\nThe product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n*Alternative Consideration:* One might consider an E2 elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride (Step 3) strongly points against this, as thionyl chloride characteristically reacts with carboxylic acids and alcohols, not enones under these conditions. Thus, the Favorskii rearrangement is the most chemically sound pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is added as a non-nucleophilic base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding further to the primary alcohol.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is:\n      H_aldehyde\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n   H_α-C1--CH₂(C2)\n      /  \\\n  CH₂(C5)  CH₂(C3)\n     \\  /\n      CH₂(C4)\n\nWe analyze the hydrogens based on their chemical environment:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (H_aldehyde):** This proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its environment is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The Alpha Proton (H_α):** This is the single proton on C1, the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group. Its environment is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** Due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation) in the cyclopentane ring, there is a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This makes the C2 and C5 positions chemically equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are **diastereotopic**. One is 'cis' to the aldehyde group and the other is 'trans'. They are not interchangeable by symmetry operations and are in different chemical environments. Therefore, they give two distinct signals. (2 types)\n4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** The same plane of symmetry makes the C3 and C4 positions chemically equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are also diastereotopic. They are further from the aldehyde group, so their chemical environment is different from the C2/C5 protons. They also give two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the total number of distinct hydrogen types:**\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1 H) + 2 (C2/C5 Hs) + 2 (C3/C4 Hs) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>"
