    "This problem requires us to find the pH of a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The key is to determine the final composition of the solution after all possible neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L\n    Molarity = 0.1 M\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L\n    Molarity = 0.2 M\n    HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L\n    Molarity = 0.3 M\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles\n    Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, the moles of OH- are:\n    Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react first with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    H+ + OH- → H2O\n    Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 moles\n    Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 moles\n    Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n    Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 moles - 0.08 moles = 0.10 moles\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 moles\n    Moles of OH- available = 0.10 moles\n    The weak acid will be completely consumed by the excess strong base.\n    Moles of OH- remaining after this reaction = 0.10 moles - 0.05 moles = 0.05 moles\n    Moles of CH3COO- (conjugate base) formed = 0.05 moles\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution will be primarily determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L\n\nLet's compute the exact value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.4\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.5\n\n# Neutralization\n# Strong acid vs strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n# Remaining strong base vs weak acid\nmoles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Final concentration\ntotal_volume = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 # in Liters\nconcentration_oh = moles_oh_final / total_volume\n\n# pOH and pH calculation\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"[OH-] = {concentration_oh:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"pOH = {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH = {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>[OH-] = 0.0417 M\npOH = 1.38\npH = 12.62\n\nThe final concentration of OH- is 0.0417 M.\npOH = -log10(0.0417) ≈ 1.38\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution formed by mixing a weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH), a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of moles of H+ and OH- ions.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Concentration = 0.1 M\n    Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 moles CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Concentration = 0.2 M\n    Moles of H+ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 moles H+\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-). Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Concentration = 0.3 M\n    Moles of OH- = Volume × Concentration × 2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.18 moles OH-\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with all available acid. It's more efficient to combine the moles of acid first, but we must remember the strong acid reacts preferentially.\nTotal moles of acid available for neutralization = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH\nTotal moles of acid = 0.08 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.13 moles\n\nThe strong base will react with the strong acid first, and then with the weak acid.\nReaction: H+(acid) + OH-(base) → H2O\nInitial moles of H+ (total acid) = 0.13 moles\nInitial moles of OH- (total base) = 0.18 moles\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than total moles of acid, all the acid will be consumed, and there will be an excess of OH-.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- remaining after neutralization:**\n    Excess OH- = Initial OH- - Total acid\n    Excess OH- = 0.18 moles - 0.13 moles = 0.05 moles OH-\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- and determine the pH.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- ions. To find the concentration, we need the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final Concentration of OH-:**\n    [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
