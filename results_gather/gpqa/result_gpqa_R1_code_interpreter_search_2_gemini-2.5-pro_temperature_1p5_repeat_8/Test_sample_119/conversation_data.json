    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`d`). For simplicity, let's use the standard astronomical definition where `d = 1/plx`, with `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Define the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, denoted by `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    The total number of stars (`N`) within this volume is the product of the number density and the volume:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars changes with parallax, not distance. So, we substitute the distance-parallax relationship (`d = 1/plx`) into the equation for `N`:\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n    This equation `N(plx)` represents the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since these are all the stars within the distance `d = 1/plx`).\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's denote this quantity as `n(plx)`.\n    `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)|`\n    We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be positive. `N(plx)` is a decreasing function of `plx` (as `plx` increases, the volume considered decreases, so the number of stars `N` also decreases), so its derivative will be negative.\n\n6.  **Perform the differentiation.**\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    Since `(4/3)πρ` is a constant, we can pull it out of the derivative:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * d/d(plx) [plx⁻³]`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx [xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹`):\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻³⁻¹) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n7.  **Determine the proportionality.**\n    Taking the absolute value to get `n(plx)`:\n    `n(plx) = | -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ | = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
