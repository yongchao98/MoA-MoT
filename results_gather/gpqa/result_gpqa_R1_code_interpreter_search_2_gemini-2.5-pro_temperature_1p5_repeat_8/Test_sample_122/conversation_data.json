    "Here's my thinking process to solve this special relativity problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Frame S: The reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary for this problem).\n    *   Frame S': The reference frame of the supernova ejecta (the moving frame).\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v): The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (Δt'): This is the time measured on a clock traveling with the ejecta, which is given as 50 seconds. In relativity, this is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀). So, Δt₀ = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c): The standard value is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame, I need the velocity (v) in that frame and the time elapsed (Δt) in that same frame. The formula is simply `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   I have the velocity (v = 60,000 km/s).\n    *   I need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt). The time given (50 s) is the proper time (Δt₀) in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   I must use the time dilation formula from special relativity to relate the time in the moving frame (Δt₀) to the time in the stationary frame (Δt).\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculations Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        *   v = 60,000 km/s\n        *   c = 300,000 km/s\n        *   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n        *   γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²)\n        *   γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)\n        *   γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n        *   Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   d = v * Δt\n        *   d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]\n        *   d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km\n        *   d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km\n\n    *   **Step E: Compute the final numerical value.**\n        *   I will use a calculator or a simple script to get the value of `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50   # s (proper time in ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dt) using the time dilation formula\n# dt = dt0 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\ndt = dt0 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\n# distance = velocity * time_in_galaxy_frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<<<\n3061862.178478471\n>>>\nThe calculation shows the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, often denoted as `Δt₀`, because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   An observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now we can calculate the distance as measured by an observer in the Galaxy.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * [ (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96)`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Using the code output provided: `3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862.18 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
