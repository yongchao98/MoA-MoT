    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of two stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to relate the population of different energy levels to the temperature.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`i`):\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i) / (k * T) )\n\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star:**\n    Let's define the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the lower state as `R = N_j / N_i`.\n\n    *   For `star_1` with temperature `T_1`:\n        `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) )`\n\n    *   For `star_2` with temperature `T_2`:\n        `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that iron atoms in `star_1` are \"twice as excited\" as in `star_2`. This means the ratio of excited to lower state atoms in `star_1` is twice that in `star_2`.\n    *   `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from Step 3:\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) ) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_2) ) ]`\n\n    Since we are considering the same atomic transition in both stars, the energy levels (`E_j`, `E_i`) and their statistical weights (`g_j`, `g_i`) are the same. Therefore, the term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out from both sides:\n    `exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Relationship Between Temperatures:** To solve for the temperatures, we can manipulate the equation algebraically.\n\n    *   First, take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n        `ln[ exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) ) ] = ln[ 2 * exp( -ΔE / (k * T_2) ) ]`\n\n    *   Use the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp( -ΔE / (k * T_2) ) ]`\n        `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)` on one side:\n        `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        `(ΔE / k) * ( 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ) = ln(2)`\n\n    *   Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n        `(ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ) = ln(2)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:**\n    *   The problem states the energy difference is `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    The problem is set up so that the ratio `ΔE / k` is very close to 1:\n    `ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n    `(1) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ) = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Final Equation and Comparison:** The final derived equation is:\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect\n    B) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct**\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect\n\n<<<C>>>"
