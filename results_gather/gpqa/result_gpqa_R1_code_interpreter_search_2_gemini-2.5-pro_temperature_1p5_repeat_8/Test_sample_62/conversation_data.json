    "This problem requires us to calculate the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule, causing it to transition from its ground state to the next lowest possible energy state.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n$E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the vibrational quantum number.\n*   $J = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the rotational quantum number.\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   $I$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe moment of inertia $I$ is calculated as $I = \\mu R^2$, where $R$ is the bond length and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the molecule, given by $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y}$.\n\n### 2. Identifying the States and the Transition\n\n*   **Fundamental State (Ground State):** This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: $v=0$ and $J=0$.\n    $E_{0,0} = \\hbar \\omega (0 + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} (0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega$\n\n*   **Next State with the Lowest Possible Energy:**\n    We need to find the energy of the photon required for a transition from the ground state $(v=0, J=0)$. There are two interpretations of the \"next lowest energy state\":\n    1.  The absolute next energy level is the first excited rotational state, $(v=0, J=1)$. This is a pure rotational transition.\n    2.  The next energy level involving a change in the vibrational state. According to selection rules for rovibrational absorption from $J=0$, the transition must be $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = +1$. This leads to the final state $(v=1, J=1)$.\n\n    Let's calculate the energy change for both scenarios. First, we need the moment of inertia, $I$.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps\n\n**a. Calculate the Reduced Mass ($\\mu$)**\n*   $M_X = 20 \\text{ amu}$\n*   $M_Y = 2 \\text{ amu}$\n*   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n*   $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} \\approx 1.8182 \\text{ amu}$\n*   $\\mu = 1.8182 \\times (1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 3.02 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n\n**b. Calculate the Moment of Inertia ($I$)**\n*   $R = 2 \\text{ angstroms} = 2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n*   $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.02 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n*   $I = (3.02 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) \\text{ kg m}^2 = 1.208 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$\n\n**c. Calculate the Energy Change ($\\Delta E$) for the Transition**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states, $\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial}$.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Pure Rotational Transition to (v=0, J=1)**\n    $E_{0,1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}(1)(2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    $\\Delta E_{rot} = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    This transition has a much lower energy than the options suggest.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Rovibrational Transition to (v=1, J=1)**\n    This interpretation aligns with standard spectroscopic problems and the given answer choices.\n    $E_{1,1} = \\hbar \\omega (1 + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}(1)(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    $\\Delta E_{rovib} = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n**d. Calculate the Momentum ($p$)**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by $E = pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s). Therefore, $p = \\Delta E / c$.\n\nWe will now perform the numerical calculation using a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34  # J*s (Reduced Planck constant)\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27 # kg/amu\nc = 3.0e8 # m/s\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_angstrom = 2.0\nomega = 4.0e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert to SI units\nMx = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR = R_angstrom * 1.0e-10\n\n# Calculate reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\n# Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# The transition is from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next accessible\n# rovibrational state (v=1, J=1).\n# The energy of the absorbed photon is Delta_E = E(1,1) - E(0,0)\n# E(v,J) = h_bar*omega*(v+0.5) + (h_bar^2 / (2*I)) * J*(J+1)\n# Delta_E = [h_bar*omega*(1.5) + (h_bar^2 / I)] - [h_bar*omega*(0.5)]\n# Delta_E = h_bar*omega + h_bar^2/I\n\nDelta_E = h_bar * omega + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# Calculate photon momentum p = Delta_E / c\np = Delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"{p:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.41e-28\n\nThe calculation shows that the momentum is $1.41 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s.

    "The problem asks for the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that causes it to transition from its ground state to the next lowest energy state. This is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Rovibrational Model\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in this model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n$E_{v,J} = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n*   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   $I$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** This is the state with the minimum possible energy, which occurs at the lowest quantum numbers: $v=0$ and $J=0$.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\hbar \\omega (0 + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} (0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega$\n\n*   **Final State (Next Lowest Energy State):** For a molecule to absorb a photon from the $J=0$ state, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions dictate that $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = +1$. Therefore, the transition must be from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=1, J=1)$.\n    $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = \\hbar \\omega (1 + 1/2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} (1)(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n### 3. Calculating Photon Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between these two states:\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega\\right)$\n$\\Delta E = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n### 4. Calculating Photon Momentum ($p$)\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum ($p$) and the speed of light ($c$) by the equation $E = pc$. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{1}{c} \\left(\\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\right)$\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n    $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{(20 \\text{ amu}) \\times (2 \\text{ amu})}{20 \\text{ amu} + 2 \\text{ amu}} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} \\approx 1.8182 \\text{ amu}$\n    Converting to kilograms:\n    $\\mu \\approx 1.8182 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    Given bond length $R = 2$ angstroms $= 2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n    $I = \\mu R^2 \\approx (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n    $I \\approx (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) \\text{ kg m}^2 \\approx 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms for the energy change:\n*   $\\hbar \\omega = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n*   $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s})^2}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2} \\approx \\frac{1.112 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46}} \\text{ J} \\approx 9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe total energy of the photon is:\n$\\Delta E = (4.218 \\times 10^{-20}) + (9.208 \\times 10^{-23}) \\text{ J} \\approx 4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\nFinally, calculate the momentum:\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 1.409 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ kg m/s}$ (or N·s)\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\nThe Python code executed in the thought process confirms this result:\n`p = 1.41e-28` N·s\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $p = 1.4 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s\nB) $p = 2.3 \\times 10^{-27}$ N·s\nC) $p = 1.9 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s\nD) $p = 1.1 \\times 10^{-27}$ N·s\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
