    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100:32, or approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl isotope to the ³⁷Cl isotope is roughly 3:1.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options:\n        *   C₇H₅ClO₂ (all options A, B, C, D have this formula): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5. This is consistent with a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the classic signature of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets, and each integrates to two protons. This splitting pattern (two doublets for four aromatic protons) is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two doublets.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acyl chloride/ester. It lacks a carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the very broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n        *   MS: It contains one chlorine and has a molecular weight of ~156.5 g/mol. (Matches)\n        *   IR: It is a carboxylic acid. (Matches)\n        *   ¹H NMR: It has a carboxylic acid proton and is para-substituted, which would give two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. (Matches)\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde and a phenol. It does not have a carboxylic acid group, so it would not have the characteristic NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. It would show an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All the provided spectral data are perfectly consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
