    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n    The reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂).\n    *   **4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:** This is an enol, a molecule containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom that is double-bonded to another carbon atom (C=C-OH). Enols are tautomers of ketones. The keto form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n    *   **Bromine (Br₂):** This is a halogen which acts as an electrophile in this reaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reactivity of the enol.**\n    Enols are electron-rich due to the pi system of the double bond and the lone pairs on the oxygen atom. They are nucleophilic and readily react with electrophiles. The reaction of an enol with a halogen (like Br₂) is a classic example of this reactivity and is the key step in the alpha-halogenation of ketones.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the reaction mechanism.**\n    The reaction does not proceed through the keto-enol equilibrium first; rather, the enol that is present reacts directly with the bromine.\n    1.  **Electrophilic Attack:** The electron-rich C=C double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule. The bromine atom adds to the carbon atom at the 2-position (the α-carbon relative to the eventual carbonyl group). This breaks the Br-Br bond and creates a bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This attack forms a resonance-stabilized oxocarbocation intermediate. The positive charge is located on the carbon at the 1-position, which is stabilized by the lone pair of electrons on the adjacent oxygen atom.\n    3.  **Deprotonation:** A weak base in the mixture (such as the Br⁻ ion formed in the previous step or a solvent molecule) removes the proton from the positively charged oxygen atom. This step re-forms the very stable carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), yielding the final product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the structure of the product.**\n    *   The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between C1 and C2, the -OH is on C1, and two methyl groups are on C4.\n    *   The bromine atom adds to C2.\n    *   The hydroxyl group on C1 is converted into a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The two methyl groups on C4 remain in their position.\n    *   The resulting molecule is a cyclopentanone ring with a carbonyl group at C1, a bromine atom at C2, and two methyl groups at C4.\n\n*   **Step 5: Name the product and compare with the options.**\n    The product is named based on the IUPAC rules for ketones. The carbonyl carbon is assigned position 1. Therefore, the bromine atom is on C2, and the two methyl groups are on C4. The name of the product is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    *   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. The bromination occurs at the α-position (C2), not on the carbon with the methyl groups.\n    *   B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Correct. This matches our derived product.\n    *   C) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This would be the product of an addition of Br₂ across the double bond without the rearrangement to the ketone. The formation of the stable C=O bond makes the α-bromoketone the major product.\n    *   D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect, for the same reason as C.\n\nThe major outcome is the formation of the α-bromoketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
