    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C=O).\n        *   A single ¹H peak for vinylic protons in a *cis*-alkene suggests high symmetry.\n        *   Two ¹³C peaks also indicate symmetry (one type of alkene carbon, one type of carbonyl carbon).\n        *   This uniquely identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n            ```\n               O\n              / \\\n            C---C=O\n           /   /\n         H-C=C-H\n            \\\n             O\n            ```\n            The two vinyl protons are equivalent (δ ≈ 7.0-7.3 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, as are the two vinyl carbons.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. The methyl groups are on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a -CH₂- group.\n            ```\n                    C5H2\n                   /   \\\n               Me-C4 = C3-Me\n                 |     |\n               Me-C1 = C2-Me\n            ```\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**, a [4+2] reaction between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   Since the diene is cyclic, the product will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n        *   The **endo product** is formed when the dienophile (maleic anhydride) is positioned under the diene system during the transition state. This is typically the **kinetically favored product** and therefore the **major product**.\n        *   The **exo product** is formed when the dienophile is positioned away from the diene system. This is typically the **thermodynamically favored product** (less steric hindrance) and therefore the **minor product** under standard reaction conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   Let's draw the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products. The product has a molecular formula of C13H16O3, which matches the sum of the reactants (C9H14 + C4H2O3).\n    *   The product has several distinct sets of protons:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are attached to saturated carbons. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: Upfield, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_v):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: Downfield compared to Me_bh, ~1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Anhydride Bridge Protons (H_anhydride):** Two equivalent protons (on C5, C6) that were part of the maleic anhydride. They are alpha to carbonyl groups. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Expected chemical shift: Downfield, ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (*syn* and *anti*) and would likely give two separate signals, but for this analysis we can consider them as the C7 protons.\n\n4.  **Use NOESY to Distinguish Between Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of spatially proximate protons.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. This must be due to the difference in stereochemistry (*endo* vs. *exo*).\n\n    *   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (Me_v)**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between their signals.\n         \n\n    *   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **vinylic methyl groups (Me_v)** but are close to the **bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bh)**. The NOE between H_anhydride and Me_v would be absent or very weak.\n         \n\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product is the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **Me_v**.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings to the Given Options:**\n    *   We need to find the option that describes the signals for H_anhydride and Me_v.\n    *   **Me_v:** 6H singlet, chemical shift ~1.6-2.0 ppm.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** 2H singlet, chemical shift ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n\n    *   Let's evaluate the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely Me_bh) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (likely Me_v). These groups are far apart.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely one of the C7 protons) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely H_anhydride). This NOE is plausible for the endo product, but the NOE between Me_v and H_anhydride involves 8 protons in total and is expected to be more prominent.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely Me_bh) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely one of the C7 protons). Not the key distinguishing NOE.\n        *   D) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. This perfectly matches our assignment for the **vinylic methyls (Me_v)** and the **anhydride bridge protons (H_anhydride)**. The chemical shifts are reasonable, and this interaction is the classic way to confirm *endo* stereochemistry in this type of adduct.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product's NOESY spectrum connects the vinylic methyls with the protons on the anhydride-derived bridge due to their spatial proximity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
