    "This question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield upon electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituent on the benzene ring determines the position of the incoming electrophile (Br+). Substituents are classified as either ortho, para-directors or meta-directors.\n\nThe given substances are:\n1)  Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n2)  Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n3)  Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n4)  Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n5)  Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n6)  Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents and their directing effects.**\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They generally produce a high yield of ortho and para isomers combined, with the para isomer often being a significant fraction.\n    *   -CH3 (in Toluene, 1): Activating group.\n    *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group.\n    *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group, but an ortho, para-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is typically very low.\n    *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating group.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating group.\n\nFrom this classification, we can immediately conclude that the compounds with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, and compounds with ortho, para-directing groups will have the highest yield.\nSo, the correct order will look like: {meta-directors in some order} < {ortho, para-directors in some order}.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) by increasing para-isomer yield.**\n\nThe directing effect of these deactivating groups is to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is very small. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect of the group, the lower the proportion of the para product will be.\n\nThe deactivating strength of these groups follows the order:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the group that most strongly directs meta (and thus gives the least para product) is -NO2. The group that least strongly directs meta among these three is -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the following order:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\nLet's check this with approximate literature values for para-isomer yield in similar reactions:\n*   Nitrobenzene (4): ~0.3-0.7% para\n*   Benzoic acid (6): ~0-1.5% para\n*   Ethyl benzoate (2): ~6% para\nThe order 4 < 6 < 2 is consistent with these data.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5) by increasing para-isomer yield.**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is determined by a combination of electronic and steric effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1, -CH3) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):**\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Increased steric bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly.\n    *   This leads to a higher proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield for Toluene will be less than that for Ethylbenzene: **1 < 5**.\n    *   (Typical values: Toluene ~67% para; Ethylbenzene ~72% para)\n\n*   **Comparing Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):**\n    *   Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While they are deactivating overall, they are strongly para-directing. This is due to a combination of their strong, distance-dependent inductive withdrawal (-I effect), which disfavors the ortho position more than the para, and their resonance donation (+R effect), which activates both ortho and para positions.\n    *   The result is that halogens typically give a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than that for alkyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the para-isomer yield for Chlorobenzene will be greater than that for Ethylbenzene: **5 < 3**.\n    *   (Typical values: Ethylbenzene ~72% para; Chlorobenzene ~87% para)\n\nCombining these results, the order for the ortho, para-directors is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\n\nCombining the order of the meta-directors and the ortho, para-directors:\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThe calculated order matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
