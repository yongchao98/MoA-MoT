    "The process of solving this problem involves understanding the nature of radioactive decay and applying the principles of probability.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random process. The time until a single atom decays follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of an exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived.\n\n2.  **Define Probabilities:**\n    *   Let `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom.\n    *   The probability that the atom survives until at least time `t` is given by the survival function `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom decays by time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Solving for the survival probability part: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   We don't need to find `λ` explicitly yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question:**\n    *   We want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   The \"next 150 minutes\" means the time interval from `t = 50` to `t = 50 + 150 = 200`.\n    *   Mathematically, we want to find the conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    *   Because the decay process is memoryless, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We know `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`. We can use this to find `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   Using exponent rules: `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substitute the known value: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we can compute the probability:\n        `Probability = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   We can use a calculator or a simple script to find this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nresult = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n# Print the result as a percentage with two decimal places\nprint(f\"The probability is {result*100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe computed probability is approximately 44.02%.

    "The user wants to solve a probability problem related to radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics:**\nRadioactive decay is a first-order kinetic process. The time to decay for a single nucleus follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is the **memoryless property**. This means the probability of an event occurring in a future interval is independent of how much time has already passed without the event occurring.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model:**\nLet `T` be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\nThe probability that the atom decays by time `t` is the cumulative distribution function `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n*   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nFrom this, we can find `λ`:\n*   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n*   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n**4. Formulate the Question in Terms of Probability:**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n*   The total time elapsed since the start will be `50 + 150 = 200` minutes.\n*   We are looking for the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n**5. Apply the Memoryless Property:**\nThe memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`.\nIn our case, we are interested in the probability of decay, not survival. The probability of decaying in the next `s` minutes, given survival up to `t`, is simply the probability of a new atom decaying in `s` minutes.\n*   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**6. Calculate the Required Probability:**\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\nWe know that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`. We can use this to find `e^(-λ * 150)` without explicitly calculating `λ`.\n*   Using the property of exponents, `a^(xy) = (a^x)^y`:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substitute the value we found earlier:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given that the survival probability for 100 minutes is 0.68\n# P_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# We need to find the decay probability in the next 150 minutes, which due to the memoryless property,\n# is the same as the decay probability for a new atom in 150 minutes.\n# P_decay_150 = 1 - P_survival_150\n# P_survival_150 = (P_survival_100)^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5\n\np_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(p_decay_150 * 100)\n```",
