    "This problem is governed by the energy-time version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Apply to the Problem:**\n    *   The \"lifetime\" (τ) of a quantum state is the time interval over which it exists. We can associate this lifetime with the uncertainty in time, so Δt ≈ τ.\n    *   This lifetime implies an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in the energy level, ΔE. For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. This ΔE represents the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n    *   A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in energy (a broader energy level). A longer lifetime leads to a smaller uncertainty in energy (a sharper energy level).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s:\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **For the second state:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths. A common and safe criterion is that the energy separation must be larger than the broader of the two energy widths.\n\n    *   The broader width is the larger energy uncertainty, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for the two levels to be clearly resolved is:\n        |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n        |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find an option that is greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels, broadened by their finite lifetimes, can be clearly distinguished from each other.\n\n<<<A>>>"
