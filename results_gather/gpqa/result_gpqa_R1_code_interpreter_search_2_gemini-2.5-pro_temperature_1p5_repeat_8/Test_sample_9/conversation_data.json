    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four described exoplanets has the highest density. Density is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:** Let's break down the properties of each planet and compare them to a known reference point, which is Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n        *   This planet is essentially identical to Earth in mass and size.\n        *   Therefore, its density is the same as Earth's density.\n        *   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n        *   The density is explicitly given in the description.\n        *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n        *   This is very similar to Earth's density. (Note: A planet with 2 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth would be denser. For it to have Earth's density, it must be made of lighter materials, but the question simply gives the density value).\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n        *   This planet is a \"Super-Earth.\" It's made of the same stuff as Earth (iron, silicates, etc.).\n        *   The key concept here is **gravitational compression**. A more massive planet has stronger self-gravity. This immense gravity squeezes the planet's material, forcing the atoms closer together.\n        *   While the volume will be larger than Earth's, the increase in mass has a stronger effect on density than the increase in volume. The radius of a rocky planet grows roughly as the cube root of the mass (or even slower), while density is mass divided by radius cubed.\n        *   Because the material is the same as Earth's but is compressed more, its average density *must be higher* than Earth's.\n        *   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n        *   This is a \"sub-Earth.\" It has the same composition as Earth but is less massive.\n        *   Applying the same principle of gravitational compression, this smaller planet has weaker self-gravity.\n        *   The material will be less compressed than it is inside Earth.\n        *   Therefore, its average density *must be lower* than Earth's.\n        *   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the derived densities, it's clear that planet (c) is the only one with a density definitively greater than that of Earth (and planets a and b). Planet (d) has the lowest density. Therefore, planet (c) has the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
