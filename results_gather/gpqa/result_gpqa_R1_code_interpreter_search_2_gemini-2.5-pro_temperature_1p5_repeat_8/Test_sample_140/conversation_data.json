    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2. All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Reagent/Solvent: Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide (like 1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   The strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The two ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D). Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. This leads to two possible pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule.\n        *   This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: This is slower than abstracting H⁺ due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        *   This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond is formed between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule.\n        *   This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate is asymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a negative charge develops on C6. Protonation of C6 by NH₃ yields **2-deuterioaniline**. (The NH₂ and D groups are ortho to each other).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a negative charge develops on C1. Protonation of C1 by NH₃ yields **3-deuterioaniline**. (The NH₂ and D groups are meta to each other).\n        *   These two products are distinct isomers (isotopomers).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        *   The non-deuterated benzyne intermediate is symmetrical. Attack by NH₂⁻ on C1 or C2 is equivalent and leads to the same product after protonation.\n        *   The product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\n         \n\n5.  **Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\n    *   Combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we identify three distinct possible organic products:\n        1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n        2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
