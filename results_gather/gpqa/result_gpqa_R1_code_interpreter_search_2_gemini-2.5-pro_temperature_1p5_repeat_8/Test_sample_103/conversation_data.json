    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be redshifted and blueshifted from our perspective. The amount of this shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight, as described by the Doppler formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The problem gives the periodic wavelength shifts as \"up to 5 miliangstrom\" and \"7 miliangstrom\". This \"up to\" value represents the amplitude of the shift. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K, is therefore directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (let's call it Aλ).\n    K ∝ Aλ\n    So, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two systems is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Aλ₁ / Aλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3)\n    where:\n    *   T is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   M_planet is the mass of the planet.\n    *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula Based on Given Information:** The problem provides the following information, which allows us to simplify the relationship between K and T:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV method measures the minimum mass, M_planet * sin(i). The phrasing \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" in the context of an RV detection problem implies that the measured minimum masses are the same for both planets. So, (M_planet * sin(i))₁ ≈ (M_planet * sin(i))₂.\n    *   The planet masses are much smaller than the star masses (M_neptune << M_sun), so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems: 2π, G, M_planet * sin(i), and M_star. This leaves a simple proportionality between K and T:\n    K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio of Periods:** From the proportionality K ∝ T^(-1/3), we can write the relationship for the two systems as:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (T₁)^(-1/3) / (T₂)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Now, we substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into this equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\n    Let's compute the numerical value.\n    (5/7)³ = 125 / 343\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can use a simple calculation:\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\n\nThe result is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
