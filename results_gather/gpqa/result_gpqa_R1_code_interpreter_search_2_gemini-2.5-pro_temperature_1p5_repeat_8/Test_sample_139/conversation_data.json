    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: The melting point of B.**\n    The substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 2 & 3: The reaction of X and Y.**\n    Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form a gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O).\n    If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide (like M(OD)ₙ).\n    If G is a deuteroxide, it means deuterium came from either X or Y (or both).\n    The reaction also releases gas W, whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's check common gases:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). Yes.**\n    *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). Yes.**\n    *   **O₂ (Oxygen gas): 16 protons (8+8), 16 neutrons (8+8). Yes.**\n    *   CH₄: 10 protons, 6 neutrons. No.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 8 & 9: The identity of Substance X.**\n    *   Clue 1: X contains a \"heavier isotope\" of one of its elements. This aligns with the presence of Deuterium (D).\n    *   Clue 9: X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The analog would be the version with the lighter, more common isotope.\n    *   Clue 8: X reacts with a keto acid (general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means the reaction is a reduction that removes an oxygen atom or functional group containing it.\n    *   Powerful reducing agents are used for this. A very common one is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlH₄ reduces a keto acid to a diol. R-C(=O)-COOH is reduced to R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This product has 2 oxygen atoms. This perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly likely that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Verify the entire reaction scheme with X = LiAlD₄.**\n    *   If X is LiAlD₄, it reacts violently with water. Since D₂O (B) is a product, it's plausible that the reactant liquid Y is also D₂O.\n    *   Proposed Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   Is this consistent with the clues?\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: Contains the heavier isotope D. ✓\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. ✓\n        *   **Violent reaction**: Reaction of LiAlD₄ with water (or heavy water) is extremely violent. ✓\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: As shown in step 2, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. ✓\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Aluminum hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so aluminum deuteroxide would be as well. ✓\n        *   **Heating G releases B**: Heating Al(OD)₃ decomposes it: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n        *   **Melting point of B**: B is D₂O, which melts at ~277 K. ✓\n    *   All clues are consistent with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   By atomic number, the lightest element is **Hydrogen** (Z=1).\n    *   By atomic number, the heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Z=13).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We can use integer mass numbers for the isotopes.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D or ²H) ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (the stable isotope is ²⁷Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄. Their total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of Aluminum in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
