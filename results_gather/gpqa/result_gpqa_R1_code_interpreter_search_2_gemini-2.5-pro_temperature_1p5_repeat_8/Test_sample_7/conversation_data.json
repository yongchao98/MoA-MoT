    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the phenotypes of single mutants:** This tells us the individual contribution of each gene to the resistance phenotype.\n    *   Wild-type (Control): 100% resistance (baseline).\n    *   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product is responsible for some part of the resistance. The loss of G1 leads to a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely abolishes resistance. This is a very strong phenotype, suggesting G2 plays a critical, central role in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The G3 gene product is also important. Its loss causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phenotypes of double mutants to determine gene interactions (epistasis):** Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one mutation masks the effect of another. In a genetic pathway, the upstream gene is typically epistatic to the downstream gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the upstream single mutant.\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` single mutant (75%). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation. This strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` single mutant (50%). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is also epistatic to the `g3` mutation. This suggests that G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings from the g2 interactions:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it is the most upstream element of the three. Given the information that \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream,\" G2 is the prime candidate for this transcription factor. It likely activates the expression of both G1 and G3. This conclusion immediately rules out option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n4.  **Analyze the g1g3 double mutant interaction:** This interaction tells us about the relationship between G1 and G3, which are both downstream of G2.\n    *   Resistance of `g1`: 75% (a loss of 25% from control).\n    *   Resistance of `g3`: 50% (a loss of 50% from control).\n    *   If G1 and G3 acted in completely separate, independent pathways, their effects would be additive. The expected resistance would be 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%.\n    *   The fact that the double mutant has a much lower resistance (10%) than expected from an additive model (25%) indicates a synergistic interaction. This means the combined loss of both genes has a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects. A common biological reason for such a synergistic relationship is **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform partially overlapping functions. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function is lost more completely than expected.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the remaining options (A, B, C):**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The claim of \"pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from an experiment that only measures a single trait (disease resistance). So, this option is unlikely. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the g1 mutant phenotype (75%).\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** While G2 regulating both G1 and G3 is consistent with them sharing promoter elements, it's a specific molecular mechanism that isn't directly proven by this data. More importantly, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the g3 mutant phenotype (50%).\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor. It also correctly identifies the relationship between G1 and G3 as \"gene redundancy\" based on the synergistic phenotype of the `g1g3` mutant. The third claim, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on a strict definition of epistasis. However, compared to the other options, this option contains two strongly supported conclusions drawn directly from the data (G2 is a TF, and G1/G3 are redundant). The other options contain unsupported claims (pleiotropy) or less accurate descriptions of the G1/G3 interaction. Therefore, this is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data strongly supports that G2 is an upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 have redundant functions. Option C is the only one that captures these two key findings.\n\n<<<C>>>"
