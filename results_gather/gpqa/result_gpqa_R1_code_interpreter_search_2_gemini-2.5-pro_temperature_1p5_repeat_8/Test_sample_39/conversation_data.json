    "*   **Analysis of the situation:** The conversation is between two synthetic organic chemists. A key part of synthetic chemistry is not just making the desired compound but also purifying it from the starting materials, solvents, and any byproducts of the reaction. The chemist is expressing frustration (\"Not well\"), indicating a problem with this purification process.\n\n*   **Meaning of the phrase \"on top of each other\":** This is a common colloquialism in chemistry labs. It refers to the inability to separate two or more different chemical compounds using a specific technique. The compounds behave so similarly under the conditions of the separation that they come out of the process together rather than as distinct, pure substances.\n\n*   **Evaluating the separation techniques and corresponding options:**\n\n    *   **Chromatography (related to option B):** The most common method for purifying compounds in a synthetic lab is chromatography (e.g., thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for analysis, or column chromatography for preparative separation). This technique separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This partitioning is governed almost entirely by the compounds' **polarity**. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel through the chromatography column at nearly the same speed and elute together. On a TLC plate, they would appear as a single spot or two overlapping spots, literally \"on top of each other.\" This is a perfect match for the chemist's statement.\n\n    *   **Distillation (related to option C):** This technique separates liquids based on differences in their **boiling points**. If two compounds have very similar boiling points, they cannot be effectively separated by distillation. While this is a valid separation problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual representation of a chromatogram (TLC plate or column bands) than the output of a distillation.\n\n    *   **Polarimetry (related to option D):** This is an *analytical* technique, not a preparative separation technique. It measures the **optical rotation** of a chiral compound. While having similar optical rotations could make it hard to distinguish between two compounds, it doesn't represent a failure to *separate* them. The compounds would have to be separated first before their optical rotation could be measured individually.\n\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions (related to option A):** While these interactions are fundamental to chemistry, they don't directly describe a common separation problem in the way the phrase is used. In fact, differences in non-covalent interactions (like hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole forces) are what *give rise* to differences in polarity and boiling points, which are then exploited for separation. The phrase refers to the macroscopic outcome of a failed separation, not the specific molecular forces themselves.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is overwhelmingly used to describe a failure to separate compounds by chromatography. Since chromatographic separation is based on polarity, the root cause of the problem is that the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
