    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Understand Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen atom, with a corresponding shift of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These sp²-hybridized alpha-carbons do have hydrogen atoms. However, removing one of these protons is difficult, and the resulting enol structure would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the quinone. Standard keto-enol tautomerism requires an sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon. Due to the lack of an sp³ alpha-carbon and the stability of its conjugated system, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 4, and 6. These are all sp³-hybridized.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These are acidic protons.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. It can undergo a series of enolizations to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors this form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows very significant tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understand Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it cannot have an enantiomer and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   **A (does not show tautomerism):** Benzoquinone\n*   **B (shows optical isomerism):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
