    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is sterically bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe final 1,2,3-substitution pattern is complex to achieve directly, suggesting a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group transformations. The last step is very likely a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) to form the ethoxy group, which implies the immediate precursor is a phenol: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the target product.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence attempts to introduce the nitro group, reduce it to an amine, then perform further reactions. Starting with tert-butylbenzene, nitration (ii) would predominantly yield the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group. Forcing the synthesis through the minor ortho-isomer would result in a very low yield. Furthermore, the sequence of reactions does not lead to the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern. For instance, nitrating 4-tert-butylaniline (from steps i-iii) would yield 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline, which ultimately leads to a product with a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, not 1,2,3. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction does not work because the lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating ammonium salt (-NH3+), which prevents the alkylation. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins correctly with tert-butylation (i) and nitration (ii) to form (mostly) 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) is the addition of NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (5-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid) does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible at this stage. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This option seems the most chemically plausible, although the order of steps as written might be slightly confusing. Let's trace the synthesis according to the reagents provided, reordering them logically where necessary to form the product. This pathway uses a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group.\n\n    1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation occurs at the para position due to the steric hindrance of the bulky tert-butyl group. This blocks the para position.\n    3.  **iii) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** Now, nitration occurs ortho to the t-Bu group because the para position is blocked. The t-Bu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to this same position (C2).\n    4.  **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    5.  **v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-sulfobenzenediazonium salt.** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (Note: Step vii is placed before vi for the synthesis to work).\n    7.  **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** Now, we nitrate again. The powerful activating, o,p-directing hydroxyl group (-OH) directs the new nitro group to its ortho position (C3). This is the key step to establish the 1,2,3 relationship.\n    8.  **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation). We are now left with our key phenolic precursor.\n    9.  **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is converted to its conjugate base by NaOH, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis, forming the final product.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and leads to a high yield of the desired product. The reagents listed in Option B are all necessary for this pathway. Despite the apparent jumbling of steps (vi) and (vii) in the option's text, it is the only choice that provides a viable synthetic route.\n\n<<<B>>>"
