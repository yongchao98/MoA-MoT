    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (tagged with GFP).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, part of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT). This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cells of Interest:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these active Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response.\n    *   **Key Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these cells reveals \"high variability.\" This is the critical clue. The question is about what process generates high variability in the variable region of antibodies *during an active immune response*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of the key finding:**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). It does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen binding. Therefore, CSR does not cause the observed \"high variability\" in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (a cascade of proteins) and is not directly involved in altering the genes of B cells.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the DNA encoding the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose is to select for B cells that produce antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen. This process is the direct cause of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of proliferating B cells during an immune response. This perfectly matches the observation.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors by randomly combining V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. However, this occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen encounter, in a population of cells that are already proliferating in response to that antigen.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
