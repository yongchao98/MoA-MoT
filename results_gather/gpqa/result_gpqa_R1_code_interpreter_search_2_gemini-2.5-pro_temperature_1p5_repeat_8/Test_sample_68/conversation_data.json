    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector (like the CERN Bubble Chamber) needs to have to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** In a particle detector, \"observing a decay\" means being able to distinguish the point where the particle was created from the point where it decayed. If the distance between these two points (the decay length, $L$) is smaller than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$), the two points merge into one, and the decay is not resolved. Therefore, for a decay to be observed, its decay length must be greater than the detector's resolution: $L > d_{res}$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ has a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV). This means it's traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light, and we must use the principles of special relativity.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$). It is calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n\n4.  **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels before decaying follows an exponential decay law. The *mean decay length* ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   We can express the mean decay length as $\\lambda = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    *   The velocity $v$ is related to the speed of light $c$ by the factor $\\beta = v/c$. So, $\\lambda = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n5.  **The Probability of Observation:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $L$ greater than the resolution $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law for distance:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda}$\n    This represents the fraction of decays that will be observable.\n\n6.  **Applying the Condition:** The problem requires that we observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This translates to the mathematical condition:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n7.  **Solving for the Resolution:** To find the required resolution, we can solve the inequality for $d_{res}$:\n    $-d_{res} / \\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n    This means the resolution $d_{res}$ must be less than or equal to a maximum value. A smaller resolution is a better, more precise measurement. The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\", which in this context means the coarsest (largest) possible resolution value that still satisfies the condition. If the detector's resolution were any worse (larger) than this value, it would observe less than 30% of the decays. Thus, we solve for the equality:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n8.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug in the given values to find the numerical answer.\n    *   Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Calculate Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   Calculate velocity factor $\\beta$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.0159} \\approx 0.992$\n    *   Calculate mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n        $\\lambda = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0 = (0.992) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (7.918) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 1.886 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   Calculate the required resolution $d_{res}$:\n        $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = -(1.886 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n        $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nTo perform the calculation more accurately, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\nE = 27  # GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 3e8  # m/s\n\n# 1.

The minor discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for the speed of light ($c$) or rounding conventions used in the problem's source. However, the order of magnitude and the leading digits are consistent with option A, while the other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\nFinal check of the calculation in the question: they might have used the approximation $\\beta \\approx 1$.\nIf $\\beta = 1$:\n$\\lambda = c \\gamma \\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8) \\times (7.918) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n$d_{res} = -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times \\ln(0.3) \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThis approximation doesn't significantly change the result. The value in option A is likely correct.\n\nThe small difference could also come from what triggers the observation. Perhaps the decay must happen *before* a certain distance to be contained and observed. Let's check that interpretation: $P(L < d_{res}) \\ge 0.3$.\n$1 - e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3 \\Rightarrow e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\le 0.7 \\Rightarrow d_{res} \\ge -\\lambda \\ln(0.7)$.\n$d_{res, min} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.7) = -(1.886 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (-0.3567) \\approx 0.67 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThis does not match any option.\nTherefore, the initial interpretation is correct: the decay length must be larger than the resolution.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector requires to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** In a detector, observing a decay means being able to distinguish the decay point from the creation point. This is only possible if the distance the particle travels before decaying (the decay length, $L$) is greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$). So, for a decay to be observed, we must have $L > d_{res}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Probability Condition:** The decay length $L$ is a random variable that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n    The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which means:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution:** To find the boundary condition for the resolution, we solve the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res} / \\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n    This value represents the largest possible resolution (i.e., the \"worst\" resolution) that can still meet the 30% observation goal. Any detector with a better resolution (a smaller $d_{res}$ value) will observe more than 30%. Thus, this is the required resolution threshold.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The particle is highly relativistic, so we must account for time dilation.\n    *   The proper lifetime is $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The mean decay length is the average distance traveled in the lab frame before decay: $\\lambda = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    *   We can write the velocity $v$ as $\\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. So, $\\lambda = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate Relativistic Factors ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest energy ($m_0c^2$):\n        $E = 27$ GeV\n        $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n    *   The relativistic factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:** We can now substitute all the values. To get a precise result, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41 # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the closest value. The orders of magnitude of options B, C, and D are incorrect.

    "This problem requires us to calculate the necessary spatial resolution of a detector to observe a specific fraction of relativistic particle decays. Here is the detailed reasoning.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics of the Problem\n\n*   **Relativistic Particle:** The particle $X^0$ has a total energy ($E=27$ GeV) much larger than its rest mass ($m_0=3.41$ GeV). This means it's traveling at nearly the speed of light, and we must use the equations of special relativity.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference ($\\tau$) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels before decaying follows an exponential probability distribution. The average distance, or mean decay length ($\\lambda$), in the lab frame is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay is considered \"observed\" if the detector can resolve the point of creation from the point of decay. This means the distance the particle travels, its decay length $L$, must be greater than the detector's spatial resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Equations\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy}}{\\text{Rest Energy}} = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    Given the energies in GeV, this simplifies to $\\gamma = \\frac{27}{3.41}$.\n\n2.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\tau$. Since $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$ and $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$), we have:\n    $\\lambda = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$\n    The factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n3.  **Probability of Observation:**\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda}$\n\n4.  **Solving for Resolution:**\n    The problem requires observing *at least 30%* of the decays, so:\n    $e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the boundary condition for the resolution, we solve the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res} / \\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    $-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3.

You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.\n\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m\nB) 2.08*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
