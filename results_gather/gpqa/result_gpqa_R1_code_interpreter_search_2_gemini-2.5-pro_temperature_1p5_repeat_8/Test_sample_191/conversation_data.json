    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This conductor has a cavity inside, which is also spherical but its center is displaced from the center of the main conductor. A positive point charge, $+q$, is placed somewhere within this cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, these negative charges will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. A key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field within its material is zero ($\\vec{E}=0$). According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the total net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. The movement of charge to the inner surface (-q) leaves a net positive charge behind. To maintain overall electrical neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface. So, the charge on the outer surface is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. A closed conducting shell shields its interior from external electric fields and shields its exterior from internal electric fields. This means the electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. The configuration of the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ inside the conductor (on the cavity wall) produces a net electric field of zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since there are no other external charges or fields, and the conductor is spherical, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now we need to find the electric field at point P due to this uniform spherical shell of charge $+q$. According to the Shell Theorem (which is also a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated in a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The effective charge creating the field at P is $+q$.\n    *   This charge can be considered to be located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the spherical conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   The formula for the magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{distance^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion on Other Parameters:** The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. These details would be necessary only if we were asked to find the field *inside* the cavity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
