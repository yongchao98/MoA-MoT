    "This problem requires us to determine the comoving distance to a quasar given its spectral properties and a specific cosmological model.\n\n**1. Identify the Physical Process:**\nThe prompt describes a quasar spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a characteristic feature known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. The peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from the quasar.\n\n**2. Calculate the Redshift (z):**\nThe redshift `z` is the measure of the stretching of the wavelength of light due to the expansion of the universe. It can be calculated using the formula:\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n*   The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given as 790 nm.\n*   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (λ_rest) is a well-known atomic transition of hydrogen, approximately 121.6 nm.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.50\nz ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.50\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.50.\n\n**3. Calculate the Comoving Distance:**\nThe comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant with the expansion of the universe if the objects are moving with the Hubble flow. For a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the comoving distance `D_C` to an object at redshift `z` is given by the integral:\n\nD_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\nwhere:\n*   `D_H` is the Hubble distance, c / H₀.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `H₀` is the Hubble constant.\n*   `E(z')` is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, given by `sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ)`.\n\nThe given cosmological parameters are:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n\nThis integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically. We can use Python with its scientific libraries (`scipy.integrate`) to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# --- Constants and Cosmological Parameters ---\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n# Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nH0 = 70.0\n# Matter density parameter\nomega_m = 0.3\n# Dark energy density parameter\nomega_lambda = 0.7\n\n# --- Calculate Redshift (z) ---\n# Observed wavelength of Lyman-alpha in nm\nlambda_obs = 790.0\n# Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha in nm\nlambda_rest = 121.6\n# Calculate redshift\nz = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# --- Calculate Comoving Distance ---\n# Define the integrand for the comoving distance calculation\n# E(z') = sqrt(omega_m * (1+z')^3 + omega_lambda)\n# Integrand is 1 / E(z')\ndef integrand(z_prime):\n    return 1.0 / np.sqrt(omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + omega_lambda)\n\n# Perform the numerical integration from z'=0 to z\nintegral_result, integral_error = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n# Calculate the Hubble distance in Mpc\n# D_H = c / H0\nhubble_distance = c / H0\n\n# Calculate the comoving distance in Mpc\ncomoving_distance_mpc = hubble_distance * integral_result\n\n# Convert comoving distance from Mpc to Gpc\ncomoving_distance_gpc = comoving_distance_mpc / 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"{comoving_distance_gpc=}\")\n```\n>>>\ncomoving_distance_gpc=9.018243405763073\n>>>\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 9.02 Gpc.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes a key feature in the spectrum of a distant quasar: a peak at a specific wavelength (790 nm) followed by a significant drop in flux at all shorter wavelengths. This is a classic astronomical signature known as the **Gunn-Peterson trough**. This trough is caused by the absorption of light by the vast clouds of neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium. The absorption is extremely strong for photons with enough energy to excite hydrogen's Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition. Therefore, the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the quasar's own Lyα emission line, redshifted by the expansion of the universe. Any light emitted by the quasar at wavelengths shorter than the Lyα line is absorbed along its path to us.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The redshift `z` quantifies how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. It's calculated by comparing the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the wavelength at which the light was emitted in its rest frame (λ_rest).\n    *   Observed wavelength, λ_obs = 790 nm.\n    *   Rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, λ_rest = 121.6 nm.\n\n    The redshift formula is:\n    1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n    1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497\n    z ≈ 5.497\n\n    So, the redshift of the quasar is approximately **z = 5.5**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Comoving Distance Formula:** The question asks for the comoving distance, which is the distance between us and the quasar on a cosmic grid that expands with the universe. For the specified flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) model, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating over redshift:\n\n    D_C = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\n    where:\n    *   D_H is the Hubble Distance, `c / H₀`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The cosmological parameters are given: H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7.\n    *   E(z') is the dimensionless Hubble parameter that describes how the expansion rate changes with redshift: E(z') = √[Ω_m(1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ].\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** This integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically.
