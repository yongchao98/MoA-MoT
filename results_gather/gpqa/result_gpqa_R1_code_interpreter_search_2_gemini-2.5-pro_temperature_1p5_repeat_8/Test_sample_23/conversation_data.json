    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Note that 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. Let's test this ratio. `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` -> `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. This does not fit the empirical formula CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. This perfectly matches the empirical formula CH2.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen for any CnH2n using integer masses is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This is a very likely candidate for Z.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X (composed of liquids A and B) and mixture Y (composed of liquids C and D) both yield *only* substance Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions.\n    *   This means that molecules A, B, C, and D must all have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since Z is cyclohexane (a six-membered ring), all four compounds A, B, C, and D must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by treating mixture X with platinum and heat, resulting in a disproportionation reaction.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) and it *does not* decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane + D) gives only cyclohexane. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. Therefore, substance D must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene/alkyne. However, aromatic rings like benzene also do not decolorize bromine water (without a catalyst). Benzene (C6H6) can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature, which matches the description) to form cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that undergoes disproportionation to form Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a 1:1 reaction producing an equimolar mixture, as stated.\n    *   By balancing the atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then the total number of hydrogens must be conserved: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   A and B both have a C6 ring skeleton, and they decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated. They must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene isomers.\n    *   The possible molecular formulas are C6H10 for cyclohexene and C6H8 for cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Let's check if their hydrogen atoms sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   There is a final condition: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\"\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so it cannot be conjugated.\n        *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two common isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (which is conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (which is not conjugated).\n        *   Therefore, the diene in mixture X must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**. The other component is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
