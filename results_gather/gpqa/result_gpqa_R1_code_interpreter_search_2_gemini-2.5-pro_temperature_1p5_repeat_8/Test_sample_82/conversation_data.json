    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid is calculated as:\n        Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   This solution is then diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new total volume of the acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (or 0.04000 L).\n    *   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n        New Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Determine the equivalence point of the titration.**\n    *   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n    *   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq) is:\n        Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   25% titration means that 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point has been added.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   This amount of NaOH reacts with an equal number of moles of CH₃COOH, converting it to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n    *   At this stage, the solution is a buffer, containing both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n        where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n    *   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵).\n    *   Now, we calculate the pH:\n        pH = pKa + log(moles of A⁻ / moles of HA) = pKa + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = pKa + log(1/3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted to form 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n        Total Volume = 40.00 mL (acid) + 10.00 mL (NaOH) = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point is:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction. Kb can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C):\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵).\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        Let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n        Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02).\n    *   Once we find [OH⁻], we can calculate pOH = -log([OH⁻]).\n    *   Finally, the pH is calculated as pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\nNow, let's use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Initial Conditions & Dilution ---\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.05 * 0.02000 # moles\nvolume_diluted_acid = 0.04000 # L\n\n# --- Titration ---\nmolarity_NaOH = 0.1 # M\nvolume_NaOH_eq = initial_moles_acid / molarity_NaOH # L\n\n# --- Calculation for pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\nratio_25 = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25)\n\n# --- Calculation for pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# 1. Moles of acetate (A-) formed = initial moles of acid\nmoles_A_minus = initial_moles_acid\n\n# 2. Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_volume_eq = volume_diluted_acid + volume_NaOH_eq # L\n\n# 3. Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus_eq = moles_A_minus / total_volume_eq\n\n# 4. Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# 5. Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# Solve the quadratic equation x^2 + Kb*x - Kb*conc_A_minus_eq = 0 for x = [OH-]\n# a=1, b=Kb, c=-Kb*conc_A_minus_eq\na = 1\nb = Kb\nc = -Kb * conc_A_minus_eq\n# x = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\nOH_concentration = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\n# 6. Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Print Final Results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n<<<A>>>",
