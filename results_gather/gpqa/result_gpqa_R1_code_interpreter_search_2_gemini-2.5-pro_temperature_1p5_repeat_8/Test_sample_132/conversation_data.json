    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving acid-base equilibria. We are given a solution containing a conjugate acid-base pair, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which constitutes a buffer. We need to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-.\n\nHere's the systematic approach:\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar amounts of the initial species.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely to give 2 Na+, hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-), and water.\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4\n        Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O\n        Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume (L)\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume (L)\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n        H2PO4- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + HPO4^2- (aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   We can use the initial concentrations calculated in step 2, as the dissociation is minimal and does not significantly alter the concentrations of the buffer components.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO4^2- (aq) ⇌ H+ (aq) + PO4^3- (aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We use the concentration of [H+] calculated in step 3 and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] from step 2.\n\nWe can use a python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given constants\nvol_L = 0.200  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # Mass of KH2PO4 in grams\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # Molar mass of KH2PO4 in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in grams\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / vol_L\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / vol_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{PO4_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The python code calculated the concentration of orthophosphate ions based on the provided data.\nThe steps were:\n1.  Calculate the molar amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n2.  Determine the concentrations of the conjugate acid (H2PO4-) and conjugate base (HPO4^2-) in the 200.00 mL solution.\n3.  Use the equilibrium for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-), governed by Ka2, to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].\n4.
