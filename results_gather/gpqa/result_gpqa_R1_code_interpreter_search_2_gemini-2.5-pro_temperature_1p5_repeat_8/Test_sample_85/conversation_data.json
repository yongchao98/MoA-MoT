    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring) which is saturated (tetrahydro). It's also a lactone (a cyclic ester), with the carbonyl group at position 2. This is also known as a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R) and (S):** The carbon at position 4, bonded to the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The reactions produce the two different enantiomers, (R) and (S).\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone typically occurs through the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a δ-hydroxy carboxylic acid (a carboxylic acid with a hydroxyl group on the 5th carbon).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are all stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name:\n*   **Pentanoic acid derivative:** The base structure is a five-carbon chain.\n*   The IUPAC name implies it is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid).\n*   Structure: It's a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) at the other end (C5). An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n    HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n*   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** and an **ester**.\n*   It also has a single chiral center at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. However, it is generally **not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids**.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has a strong preference for reducing **carboxylic acids** over most other functional groups, including esters. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** The starting material A has both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu). LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group will remain untouched.\n    *   (Stereoisomer A) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[LiBH₄]-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The product of the reduction is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) will attack the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) in an intramolecular esterification reaction to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is conserved in the final lactone product. Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** The starting material B is treated with BH₃. Borane will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group untouched.\n    *   (Stereoisomer B) HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[BH₃]-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The product of this reduction is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group in an intramolecular transesterification reaction (catalyzed by the acidic workup) to form the same six-membered lactone, releasing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not affected. The stereochemistry of starting material B is conserved in the final product. Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer to produce the (R) lactone.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer to produce the (S) lactone.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
