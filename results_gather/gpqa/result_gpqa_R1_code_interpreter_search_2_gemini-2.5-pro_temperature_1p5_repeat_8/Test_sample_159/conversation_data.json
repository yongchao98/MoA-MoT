    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will become a circular aperture as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. The apothem 'a' of the polygon will become the radius of the circle.\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern:\n$I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n\nwhere:\n-   $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n-   $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n-   $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wave number.\n-   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n-   $\\theta$ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$.\nLet $z_m$ be the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$.\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n$k a \\sin\\theta_m = z_m$\n\nSubstituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\sin\\theta_m = z_m$\n\nRearranging for $\\sin\\theta_m$:\n$\\sin\\theta_m = \\frac{z_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$.\n$\\theta_m = \\frac{z_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\nThis requires the first two non-zero roots of $J_1(x)$.

    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Aperture Geometry**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity (N → ∞), a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches a circle.\n    *   In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n*   **Step 2: Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\n    *   When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n    *   The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern is given by the formula:\n        $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n        where:\n        *   $I_0$ is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n        *   $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n        *   $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wave number.\n        *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n        *   $\\theta$ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locating the Intensity Minima**\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$.\n    *   The positions of the minima are determined by the non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. Let's denote the m-th non-zero root as $z_m$.\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n        $k a \\sin\\theta_m = z_m$\n\n*   **Step 4: Applying the Small Angle Approximation**\n    *   The problem allows for the small angle approximation, where $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$.\n    *   Substituting this and the expression for $k$ into the condition for the minima:\n        $\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda} \\theta_m = z_m$\n    *   Solving for the angular position of the m-th minimum, $\\theta_m$:\n        $\\theta_m = \\frac{z_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculating the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\n    *   We need to find the angular distance $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\n    *   This requires the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$:\n        *   First root: $z_1 \\approx 3.8317$\n        *   Second root: $z_2 \\approx 7.0156$\n    *   The angular distance is then:\n        $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = \\frac{z_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} - \\frac{z_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\left(\\frac{z_2 - z_1}{2\\pi}\\right) \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n*   **Step 6: Numerical Calculation**\n    *   Let's compute the numerical coefficient $\\frac{z_2 - z_1}{2\\pi}$:\n        Coefficient = $\\frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3.1839}{2\\pi}$\n    *   We can use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# First two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n*   **Step 7: Final Result**\n    *   The code output shows that the coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n    *   Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is $\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.507 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        *   A) 0.506 λ / a\n        *   B) 1.220 λ /a\n        *   C) 0.500 λ / a\n        *   D) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   The calculated value of 0.507 is closest to option A, 0.506. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the option values or the root values used.\n\n<<<A>>>",
