    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Analyze the core concept:**\nThe \"impulse approximation\" posits that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The \"impulse\" part refers to the interaction happening over a very short time, so short that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the binding potential of the nucleus during the event.\n\n**2. Evaluate each statement:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is the foundation of the approximation. It assumes the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time, ignoring interactions with pairs of nucleons (meson-exchange currents) or the nucleus as a whole. This is known as the \"one-body current\" assumption and is essential for treating the nucleon as the primary target. This statement is a core component.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This deals with the \"final state\" of the struck nucleon. For the nucleon to be treated as free throughout the process, it must not only be struck as an individual particle but also leave the nucleus without further interactions. If the nucleus were not transparent, the exiting nucleon would scatter off other nucleons, a process known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Assuming transparency means we neglect FSI. This is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA). This statement is a core component.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is a model for how the *nucleon behaves within the nucleus* during a scattering event. It is largely independent of the model used to describe the nucleon's internal structure (i.e., its form factors). One can use the impulse approximation in both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks, and one can use nucleon form factors derived from various models, including those with relativistic quarks. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation itself; it's an additional, separate approximation about the nature of the nucleon.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the essence of the \"impulse\" idea. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid and involve such a high energy transfer that the relatively weak binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus can be ignored *during the interaction*. The nucleon is treated as if it were momentarily \"off-shell\" and free from the nuclear potential. This statement is a core component.\n\n**3. Synthesize and Conclude:**\nThe impulse approximation is fundamentally defined by treating the interaction as a \"snapshot\" of a single nucleon. This requires:\n1.  Targeting a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n2.  Ignoring the nuclear potential during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n3.  Ignoring the re-interaction of the struck nucleon with the nuclear remnant (Statement 2).\n\nStatements 1, 2, and 4 jointly describe the impulse approximation. Statement 3 is an independent assumption about the sub-structure of the nucleon.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
