    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti I) changes. Specifically, it wants the ratio in the \"no spots\" case divided by the ratio in the \"with spots\" case.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem describes the population of atoms in different energy levels within a stellar photosphere assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The governing principle for this is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n3.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (n) in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    `n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]`\n    where:\n    *   `n₁, n₂`: Number density of atoms in level 1 and 2.\n    *   `g₁, g₂`: Statistical weights (degeneracies) of level 1 and 2.\n    *   `E₁, E₂`: Energies of level 1 and 2.\n    *   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁`: The energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k`: The Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T`: The temperature of the gas (in this case, the effective temperature of the photosphere).\n\n4.  **Define the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1: No Spots (ns)**\n        *   Temperature: `T_ns = 6000 K`\n        *   Ratio: `Ratio_ns = (n₂ / n₁)_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)]`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: With Spots (s)**\n        *   Temperature: `T_s = 5500 K`\n        *   Ratio: `Ratio_s = (n₂ / n₁)_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)]`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This translates to calculating `Factor = Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`.\n\n6.  **Set up the Calculation for the Factor:**\n    `Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)] ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)] ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` are intrinsic properties of the atomic levels and cancel out:\n    `Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)]`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n    `Factor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_ns) - (-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ -ΔE / k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s) ]`\n\n7.  **Find the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels, `ΔE`.\n\n    The formula relating photon energy and wavelength is:\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where:\n    *   `h`: Planck's constant.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light.\n    *   `λ`: The wavelength.\n\n8.  **List Constants and Values:**\n    *   Planck's constant (h): `6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   Speed of light (c): `3.0 x 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   Boltzmann constant (k): `1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n    *   Wavelength (λ): `1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   Temperature (no spots, T_ns): `6000 K`\n    *   Temperature (spots, T_s): `5500 K`\n\n9.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will use a Python script for precision. The script will first calculate `ΔE`, then substitute all values into the formula for the `Factor`.\n\n    *   Step 1: Calculate `ΔE = h * c / λ`.\n    *   Step 2: Calculate `ΔE / k`. This gives the energy difference in units of Kelvin, which is convenient.\n    *   Step 3: Calculate the final factor `F = exp[-(ΔE/k) * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s)]`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_ns = 6000          # Temperature without spots in K\nT_s = 5500           # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference between the two levels\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the ratio for the \"no spots\" case\n# The (g2/g1) factor is common and will cancel out, so we can ignore it.\n# Ratio_ns is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k * T_ns))\nratio_factor_ns = np.exp(-delta_E / (k * T_ns))\n\n# Calculate the ratio for the \"with spots\" case\n# Ratio_s is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k * T_s))\nratio_factor_s = np.exp(-delta_E / (k * T_s))\n\n# Calculate the factor by which the ratio changes (Ratio_ns / Ratio_s)\nchange_factor = ratio_factor_ns / ratio_factor_s\n\n# Alternative calculation using the combined formula for clarity\n# factor = exp[ -delta_E / k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s) ]\nchange_factor_alt = np.exp(-(delta_E / k) * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{change_factor:.5f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.50858\n</execute_result>\n\n10. **Analyze the Result:** The calculated factor is approximately `4.509`. This value corresponds to the change in the ratio of `n₂/n₁` in the no-spot case versus the spot case. The fact that the factor is greater than 1 is consistent with the problem's statement that the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (since the temperature is lower).\n\n11. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) ~1.1\n    *   B) ~4.5\n    *   C) ~2.9\n    *   D) ~7.8\n\n    The calculated value of `4.509` is extremely close to option B. The information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage was extraneous, as the effective temperatures for both conditions were provided directly.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to calculate the change in the population ratio of two energy levels of an atom under two different temperature conditions. The key physical principle governing this is the Boltzmann equation, which is applicable here because the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to a lower state (level 1) is given by:\n\nn₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n-   `n₁`, `n₂` are the number densities of atoms in level 1 and level 2.\n-   `g₁`, `g₂` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n-   `E₁`, `E₂` are the energies of the levels.\n-   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n-   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   `T` is the temperature.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratios for Both Scenarios\n\nWe have two scenarios with different effective temperatures:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: No Spots (ns)**\n    *   Temperature `T_ns = 6000 K`\n    *   The population ratio is `Ratio_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)]`\n\n*   **Scenario 2: With Spots (s)**\n    *   Temperature `T_s = 5500 K`\n    *   The population ratio is `Ratio_s = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)]`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Factor of Change\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio `Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`.\n\nFactor = `Ratio_ns / Ratio_s`\nFactor = `[ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)] ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_s)] ]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` is a property of the atomic levels and cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), we get:\n\nFactor = `exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_ns) - (-ΔE / (k * T_s)) ]`\nFactor = `exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s) ]`\n\n### 4. Finding the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. We use the formula:\n\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\n\nwhere:\n-   `h` is Planck's constant.\n-   `c` is the speed of light.\n-   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\nWe can now substitute all the values into the formula for the factor. A Python script is efficient for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given Parameters\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_ns = 6000          # Temperature without spots in K\nT_s = 5500           # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) from the wavelength\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the ratio for the \"no spots\" case (proportional to the exponential term)\nratio_ns = np.exp(-delta_E / (k * T_ns))\n\n# Calculate the ratio for the \"with spots\" case\nratio_s = np.exp(-delta_E / (k * T_s))\n\n# The factor is the ratio of the two ratios\nfactor = ratio_ns / ratio_s\n\n# We can also calculate this directly using the combined formula:\n# factor = exp[ -delta_E/k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_s) ]\n# This is mathematically equivalent and numerically robust.\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.5f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.50858\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the factor is approximately 4.50858. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~1.1\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~7.8\n\nThe computed value is closest to 4.5.
