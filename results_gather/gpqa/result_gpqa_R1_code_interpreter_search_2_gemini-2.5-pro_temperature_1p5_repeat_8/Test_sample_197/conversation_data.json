    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution with known concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate, and given stability constants for the complex formation.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nCobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes in a stepwise manner:\n- Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n- Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n- Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n- Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n- β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n- β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n- β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n- β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Define Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express Species Concentrations**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ ion concentration, the free SCN⁻ ligand concentration, and the stability constants:\n- [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n- [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n- [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n- [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the desired species, [Co(SCN)₂], is α₂:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Determine the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe initial total concentration of thiocyanate is 0.1 M, and the total concentration of cobalt is 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the concentration of the ligand ([SCN⁻]) is 10 times greater than the concentration of the metal ion (c(Co)), the amount of SCN⁻ that complexes with Co²⁺ will be relatively small compared to the total amount of SCN⁻. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] as being equal to the initial total concentration.\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow we can plug the known values into the equation for α₂. To make it easier, let's first calculate the denominator (often called the alpha function denominator or the p-function), which we'll call D.\nLet [L] = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\nD = 1 + β₁[L] + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nNumerator = β₂[L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100. Let's use Python for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# Denominator of the alpha fraction formula\n# D = 1 + beta1*[SCN] + beta2*[SCN]^2 + beta3*[SCN]^3 + beta4*[SCN]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * SCN_conc**1 + beta2 * SCN_conc**2 + beta3 * SCN_conc**3 + beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# Numerator for the alpha2 fraction (for Co(SCN)2)\n# N2 = beta2*[SCN]^2\nnumerator_2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f'{percentage=}')\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 16.916%.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants (β)**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the given overall stability constants (`β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16):\n- `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n- `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n- `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n- `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe percentage of a specific species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. We are interested in `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 1 and 2, and factoring out `[Co²⁺]`, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Approximate the Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is significantly larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in large excess, the amount of `SCN⁻` consumed by complexation is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` to be equal to its initial total concentration:\n`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**5. Calculate the Result**\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for `α₂`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (`D`):\n`D = 1 + (β₁ * 0.1¹) + (β₂ * 0.1²) + (β₃ * 0.1³) + (β₄ * 0.1⁴)`\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`D = 2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator (`N₂`) for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n`N₂ = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`\n`N₂ = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = N₂ / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
