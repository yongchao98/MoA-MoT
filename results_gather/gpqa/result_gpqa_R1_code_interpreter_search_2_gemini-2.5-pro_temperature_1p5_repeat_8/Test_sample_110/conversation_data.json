    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reagents:**\n    *   This is a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile source:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Michael acceptor (electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt), an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile (enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5). It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single, specific enolate.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack:**\n    *   The negatively charged C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate Michael acceptor (the CH₂ group).\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an ester enolate. Upon workup (which is implied in this type of reaction, usually with a mild proton source like water), the enolate is protonated to give the final neutral product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   To name this product according to the options provided, we treat the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The chain is `ethyl 3-(...-cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   For naming the substituent, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1.\n    *   Original C6 (point of attachment) becomes New C1.\n    *   Original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes New C2.\n    *   Original C2 (with ethyl and methyl) becomes New C3.\n    *   Now, let's place the substituents on the new numbering system:\n        *   At New C1: a methyl group (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   At New C2: an oxo group.\n        *   At New C3: an ethyl group and a methyl group (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction and reagents:**\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile source:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-hydrogens (on the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base.\n    *   **Michael acceptor (electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile (nitronate ion):**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂`).\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile chain.\n\n4.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting nitrile-stabilized carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) during workup to yield the final product.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group at C3.\n        *   A nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
