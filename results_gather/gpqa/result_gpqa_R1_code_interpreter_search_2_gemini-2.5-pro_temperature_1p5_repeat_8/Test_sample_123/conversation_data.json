    "The problem asks for the Lorentz factor `γ` required for a certain fraction of particles to reach a detector. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and exponential decay.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of unstable particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. Its mean lifetime appears to be dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ`. The lifetime in the lab frame is `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity `v`, so `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). The time it takes for them to travel to the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is:\n    `t_travel = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is found by using the lab-frame time of flight in the decay equation, with the lab-frame (dilated) lifetime:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / T_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `T_lab`:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Applying the Given Conditions:**\n    We are given two scenarios. Let `f = N / N₀` be the survival fraction.\n\n    *   **Condition 1:**\n        *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n        Plugging these into the equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-R / (γ₁ * c * τ))`\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -R / (γ₁ * c * τ)`\n        `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ)`  (Equation A)\n\n    *   **Condition 2:**\n        *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`.\n        Plugging these into the equation:\n        `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n        Taking the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ)` (Equation B)\n\n6.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this particle and detector setup. We can find a relationship between `γ₁` and `γ₂` by combining Equation A and Equation B.\n\n    From Equation A: `R / (c * τ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    From Equation B: `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Equating the two expressions for `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    To find the numerical value of `γ₂`, we can use a python script to compute the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first condition\ngamma1 = 20.0\n\n# The formula derived is gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where ln is the natural logarithm.\n# ln(3/2) can also be written as ln(1.5).\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n\n<execute_result>\n54.18536838843187\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) 68\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 28\n\nThe value 54 is the closest match to our calculated result.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the physics and the calculation involved.\n\n**1. The Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / T_lifetime)`, where `T_lifetime` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where `t` is measured.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), a fast-moving particle's internal clock appears to run slow. Its mean lifetime, `τ` (the proper lifetime in its own rest frame), is extended by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is `T_lab = γτ`.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius of the detector) to reach the walls. Since they are ultra-relativistic (`v ≈ c`), the time this takes in the lab frame is `t_flight = R / c`.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations**\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall is found by using the lab-frame time of flight (`t_flight`) and the lab-frame lifetime (`T_lab`):\n\n`Fraction surviving = exp(-t_flight / T_lab)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_flight` and `T_lab`:\n\n`Fraction surviving = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nLet's call the constant part `k = R / (cτ)`. This value depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, but it's the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`Fraction surviving = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n**3. Applying the Given Information**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz Factor (`γ₁`) = 20\n    *   Fraction Surviving = 1/3\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation: `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`) = ?\n    *   Fraction Surviving = 2/3\n    *   Plugging these values into the equation: `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n**4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nWe can solve for `k` from the first scenario by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of the equation for the second scenario:\n`ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂`\n`ln(3) - ln(2) = k / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for `k` that we found from the first scenario:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value for `γ₂`:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2)` or `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
