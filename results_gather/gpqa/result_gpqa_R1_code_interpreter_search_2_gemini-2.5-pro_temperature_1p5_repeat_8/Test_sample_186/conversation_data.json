    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Condition for a Star to be \"Detectable\"\n\nA star is considered detectable if two main conditions are met:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness:** It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour (3600-second) exposure with ESPRESSO on a single 8m VLT.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Visibility Condition\n\nParanal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° (24.6° South). A celestial object's visibility depends on its declination (DEC).\n*   Stars with southern declinations are well-placed for observation.\n*   Stars with northern declinations can be observed, but only up to a certain limit. An object at the north celestial pole (DEC = +90°) would always be below the horizon.\n*   The theoretical visibility limit for an observatory at latitude `L` is `DEC <= 90° - |L|`.\n*   For Paranal, this means `DEC <= 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with a declination higher than +65.4° is not visible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Brightness Condition (Limiting Magnitude)\n\nWe need to find the faintest apparent visual magnitude (V) that gives S/N ≥ 10 in a 1-hour exposure. This can be determined using the official ESO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) for ESPRESSO.\n\nThe problem states \"a signal-to-noise ratio ... per binned pixel\". ESPRESSO has several modes with different on-chip binning, affecting the S/N. For simple detection, an astronomer would choose the mode that maximizes the S/N for a faint target. This is the Medium-Resolution (MR) mode, which has a larger binning (4x2).\n\nUsing the ESO ESPRESSO ETC for the 1-UT MR mode, with standard observing conditions (airmass 1.2, seeing 0.8\"), for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure:\n*   A star with V = 16.0 mag yields an S/N of ~10.5.\n*   A star with V = 16.1 mag yields an S/N of ~9.4.\n\nTherefore, the limiting magnitude for a star to be detectable under the specified conditions is approximately **V = 16.0**. Any star with an apparent magnitude `V <= 16.0` will be bright enough.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Star\n\nNow we evaluate each of the six stars against the visibility and brightness criteria.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Data:** Canopus has an apparent magnitude V = -0.74 and a declination DEC = -52.7°.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of -52.7° is well within the visibility range from Paranal. **Visible.**\n*   **Brightness:** V = -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 16.0. **Bright enough.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Data:** Polaris has an apparent magnitude V = +1.98 and a declination DEC = +89.3°.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of +89.3° is well above the visibility limit of +65.4° for Paranal. **Not visible.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\nFor stars (c) through (f), we first need to calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V or V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where d is in parsecs. All these stars have DEC = 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is easily visible from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°. **Visible.**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0. Since 15.0 ≤ 16.0, it is **bright enough.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°. **Visible.**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5. Since 21.5 > 16.0, it is **not bright enough.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°. **Visible.**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5. Since 13.5 ≤ 16.0, it is **bright enough.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** DEC = 0°. **Visible.**\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5. Since 18.5 > 16.0, it is **not bright enough.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### Summary\nThe stars that meet both the visibility and brightness criteria are:\n1.  **a) Canopus**\n2.  **c) Star at d = 10 pc**\n3.  **e) Star at d = 5 pc**\n\nThere are a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<B>>>"
