    "**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O at these specific wavenumbers strongly suggests that compound X is a carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH), while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl chain).\n    *   **Alkyl Chain Analysis (piecing together the fragments):**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is an ethyl group fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the terminal -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and another group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H corresponds to a methine proton (-CH-). This proton is bonded directly to the aromatic ring (explaining its relatively downfield shift for an alkyl proton) and is also adjacent to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The methine (-CH-) is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This structure is a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    Putting all the pieces together, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option B.\n\n**2. Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\n*   The reagent system of **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)** is a very powerful and classical reducing agent.\n*   It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding methyl groups (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the alkyl substituent) is generally inert to these conditions.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  ---(Red P, HI)---> 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n*   Comparing this name to the given options:\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure and is still an acid.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, compound X.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
