    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound is considered optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, but other structural features like axial or planar chirality can also result in an optically active molecule. Let's analyze each compound given.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   Normally, there is free rotation around this single bond. However, if there are large, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), this rotation can be sterically hindered or completely prevented.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This significant steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This restricted rotation about the C-C bond creates a chiral axis. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it chiral. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The central carbon atom is part of a double bond (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have any other source of chirality like a chiral axis or plane.\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   Due to the *trans* configuration, the molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Any molecule that has a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\n    Thus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
