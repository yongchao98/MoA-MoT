    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2\n\n*   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the gas molecules within the sample compartment. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is determined by gas-gas collisions.\n*   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. This is determined by electron-gas interactions.\n\n### 2. Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (λ)\n\nThe general formula for mean free path is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (in this case, the gas molecules).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" for a collision or scattering event.\n\n### 3. Analyze the System Conditions\n\n*   The number density (`n`) of the residual gas molecules is constant for both scenarios because the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment do not change.\n*   Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between the collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions (let's call it σ1) and the scattering cross-section for electron-gas interactions (σ2).\n\n*   For λ1: λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)\n*   For λ2: λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\n*(Note: The formula for gas-gas MFP often includes a √2 factor, λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1), to account for the movement of target molecules. However, including this factor does not change the fundamental comparison, as the key difference lies in the cross-sections.)*\n\n### 4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the effective target area of a gas molecule as seen by another gas molecule (σ1) versus as seen by a high-energy electron (σ2).\n\n*   **σ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** Gas molecules are electrically neutral overall. They interact with each other primarily through very short-range forces (van der Waals forces). A collision happens only when the molecules get very close to each other. The cross-section, σ1, is therefore related to the physical size of the molecules. This is often called the kinetic cross-section.\n\n*   **σ2 (Electron-Gas Scattering):** The electron is a fundamental charged particle. The gas molecule, while neutral overall, consists of a positively charged nucleus and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The incoming electron interacts with the molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. An electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the molecule to be affected. It can be deflected (scattered) by the molecule's electric field even when passing at a considerable distance.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Comparison:** Because the Coulomb force is long-range and the van der Waals force is short-range, the effective target area a molecule presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly larger than the area it presents to another neutral molecule (σ1). In the context of a high-resolution TEM, even a very small scattering angle is enough to remove an electron from the beam that forms the final image, making the effective cross-section for interaction very large.\n\nSo, we can conclude: **σ2 > σ1**\n\n### 5. Determine the Relationship Between λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we use the relationship between mean free path and cross-section:\n*   λ is inversely proportional to σ (λ ∝ 1/σ).\n\nSince we established that **σ2 > σ1**, it must follow that:\n1/σ2 < 1/σ1\n\nAnd therefore:\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\nThis means that an electron in the beam is much more likely to interact with a residual gas molecule than a gas molecule is to collide with another. The average distance an electron can travel unscattered (λ2) is shorter than the average distance a gas molecule can travel between collisions (λ1). This is precisely why an ultra-high vacuum is critical for electron microscopy.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Given Options\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation -> Incorrect.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect, as this implies λ2 > λ1.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect, as this implies λ2 > λ1.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 -> **Correct.** This matches our derived conclusion.\n\nThe factor of `1.22` in options B and C is likely a distractor and not relevant to the fundamental physics of the comparison.\n\n<<<D>>>"
