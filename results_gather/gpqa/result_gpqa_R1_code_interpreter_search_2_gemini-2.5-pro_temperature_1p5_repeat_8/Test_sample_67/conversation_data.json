    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle has a spin 1/2 and a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial setup is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = -γ (S ⋅ ẑ) B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. In quantum mechanics, this means the particle is in the lowest possible energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.\n*   The eigenstates of `H_initial` are the same as the eigenstates of `S_z`, which are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are:\n    *   For `|+z>`: `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   For `|-z>`: `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive (like for a proton), the lower energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`. If `γ` were negative (like for an electron), the lower energy state would be `|-z>`. As we will see, the final oscillation frequency is independent of this choice. Let's proceed with the `|+z>` state.\n*   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B_new = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t > 0` is:\n    `H = -μ ⋅ B_new = -γ (S ⋅ ŷ) B = -γB S_y`\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation, whose solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n*   Substituting our `H` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z>`\n*   This expression represents a rotation of the initial state `|+z>` around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n**Method A: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving States)**\n\n1.  Express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates (the eigenstates of `S_y`).\n    The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. In the `S_z` basis:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n2.  Apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt(ħ/2)/ħ)|+y> + exp(iγBt(-ħ/2)/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n3.  Convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `S_z` basis to make calculating `<S_z>` easy.\n    `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`.\n    After substitution and simplification (using Euler's formulas `cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i`), we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n\n4.  Calculate `<S_z>(t)`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    `<S_z>(t) = ( cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z| ) * S_z * ( cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\n    Since `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and using the orthogonality of the states:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos²(γBt/2) - (-ħ/2) * sin²(γBt/2)`\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  Finally, find the expectation value of the magnetic moment component:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n**Method B: Heisenberg Picture (Evolving Operators)**\n\n1.  The expectation value can be written as `<μ_z>(t) = γ<ψ(0)|S_z(t)|ψ(0)>`, where the operator `S_z(t)` evolves in time:\n    `S_z(t) = U(t)† S_z U(t) = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ)`\n2.  This transformation is a rotation of the `S_z` operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The result of rotating a vector `(0, 0, S_z)` around the Y-axis is `(S_z*sinθ, 0, S_z*cosθ)`. In operator terms:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z*cos(γBt) + S_x*sin(γBt)`\n3.  Now calculate the expectation value using the time-independent initial state `|+z>`:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <+z| (S_z*cos(γBt) + S_x*sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n    `<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`\n4.  We know that `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2` and `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt) * (ħ/2) + sin(γBt) * 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n5.  This gives the same result for `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 5. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n*   The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which corresponds to `ω`.\n\nComparing our result `ω = γB` with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
