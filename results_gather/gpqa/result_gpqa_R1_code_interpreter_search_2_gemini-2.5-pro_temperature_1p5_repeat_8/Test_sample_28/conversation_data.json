    "1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene. The most effective way to do this genetically is to \"knock out\" the gene's function, meaning the cell can no longer produce a functional protein from this gene.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Mutation Types and Their Impact:**\n    *   **Silent (or Synonymous) Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the resulting amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function if the change occurs at a critical site, but it could also have little or no effect. It's not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that creates a premature STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates translation, resulting in a shortened, truncated protein that is almost always non-functional, especially when it occurs early in the gene. This is a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 1 base or inserting 2 bases). This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence from that point forward and usually leading to a premature stop codon shortly after. This is also a very effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** Let's parse the beginning of each sequence into codons (groups of three bases starting from `ATG`) and determine the type of mutation.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Start, Met), `TTT` (Phe), `CTC` (Leu), `GCT` (Ala) ...\n        *   This produces the full-length, active protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr), `GCT` (Ala) ...\n        *   Comparing to the intact gene: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (both code for Phe, so this is a silent mutation), and the third codon `CTC` (Leu) changes to `TAC` (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. This might not be enough to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), `TAA` (**STOP**) ...\n        *   Comparing to the intact gene: The third codon `CTC` has been mutated to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The protein production will stop after only two amino acids (Methionine and Phenylalanine). The resulting dipeptide will be completely non-functional. This is a highly probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3’` (This is one interpretation of the sequence `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCA...`)\n        *   Codons: `ATG` (Met), `TTT` (Phe), `TAC` (Tyr), `GCT` (Ala)...\n        *   This represents a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`, Leu to Tyr). Like Mutant 1, this is not guaranteed to eliminate function. Another interpretation based on the sequence length suggests an in-frame insertion, which adds an amino acid but preserves the reading frame, making it less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (This is based on parsing the sequence `ATGTTTTACGCTACTT...`)\n        *   Analysis of the provided string lengths for Mutant 4 shows a deletion of one base compared to the intact gene. A one-base deletion causes a **frameshift mutation**. While a frameshift is also an excellent way to knock out a gene, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is presented explicitly and unambiguously in the sequence.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most direct and certain way to produce a non-functional protein. A protein that is terminated after only two amino acids cannot perform its enzymatic function. Therefore, this mutation is the one most likely to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
