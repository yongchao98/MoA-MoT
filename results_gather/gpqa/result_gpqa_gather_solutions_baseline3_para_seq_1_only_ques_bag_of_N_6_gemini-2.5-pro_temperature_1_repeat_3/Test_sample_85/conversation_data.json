Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The two reactions produce enantiomers: `(R)` in reaction 1 and `(S)` in reaction 2. A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxyester).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure.\n    *   The name suggests a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is at the C3 position.\n    *   `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` (3-ethylglutaric acid)\n    *   The name `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` implies it's a mono-ester of this diacid. Let's assume the principal group is the carboxylic acid, and the other end is the isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu` (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **`LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated to form a carboxylate (`-COO-`), which is unreactive towards reduction by LiBH4.\n*   **`BH3` (Borane):** This reagent exhibits opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`LiBH4`)-->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    The intermediate is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral center are H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOR'`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3) > `-H` (P4). The ester group outranks the acid group because the isobutyl carbon beats the acid proton.\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The `-CH2COOR'` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOH` (P1') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2') > `-CH2CH3` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The group that was P2 (`-CH2COOH`) is now P1'. The group that came from P1 (`-CH2COOR'`) is now P2' (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in priority between two groups attached to a chiral center results in a flip of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will be **(R)**. `(S)-A -> (R)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (R)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(R)-Intermediate -> (R)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`BH3`)-->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the delta-lactone (releasing isobutanol).\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A. Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3).\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The `-CH2COOH` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOR'`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1'') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2'') > `-CH2CH3` (P3''). The ester group still outranks the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The priority order of the groups (`-CH2COOR'` > `-CH2CH2OH` > `-CH2CH3`) is maintained relative to the starting material. Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation does not change.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will also be **(S)**. `(S)-B -> (S)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (S)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(S)-Intermediate -> (S)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also requires an understanding of how the reduction products cyclize to form a lactone and how stereochemistry is preserved during this process.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe name provided is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break this down to deduce the structure.\n*   \"pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes the substituent at C5. \"oxo\" means a carbonyl group (C=O), and \"isobutoxy\" means an -O-iBu group (where iBu is isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). Together, -C(=O)O-iBu represents an isobutyl ester group.\n\nSo, the molecule has a 5-carbon main chain. C1 is a carboxylic acid, and C5 is an isobutyl ester.\nThe structure is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(O)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a single stereocenter at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters much more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    (A) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring, a delta-lactone, and eliminates a molecule of water.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    (B) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the isobutyl ester. This reaction forms the same six-membered lactone and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)----C(=O)(2)\n     /         \\\n   CH2(6)      CH2(3)\n   |           |\n  CH2(5)------CH(Et)(4)\n```\nThe carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (not drawn), an ethyl group, a -CH2C(=O)- group, and a -CH2CH2O- group. The problem specifies the stereochemistry at this center: (R) for the product from reaction A, and (S) for the product from reaction B.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n     Et\n     |\nHOOC-CH2-CH-CH2-COO-iBu\n 1    2    3   4    5\n```\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is the carbon bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reducing agent has a special affinity for carboxylic acids. It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                     Et\n         |                      |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    (Starting Material A)       (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the hydroxyl (-OH) group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at the other end. This is an intramolecular esterification that forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester at C5 and cyclization involving C1 and the C5-OH) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center (C4 in the lactone, which was C3 in the starting material) must have the (R) configuration. This means starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COO-iBu) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                      Et\n         |                       |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    (Starting Material B)        (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl. This is an intramolecular transesterification that forms the same six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center must have the (S) configuration. This means starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):\n        ```\n           O(1) - C(2)=O\n          /      \\\n        C(6)H2    C(3)H2\n        |         |\n        C(5)H2 -- C(4)H(Et)\n        ```\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The ethyl group is at the central carbon.\n    *   Structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:\n        ```\n              Et\n              |\n        HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COOiBu\n         1     2    3    4      5\n        ```\n    *   The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone (6-membered ring) from this starting material implies that one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and then cyclization occurs.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a six-membered lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester at C1, forming the same six-membered lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n**Conclusion from Pathways:** Both reaction pathways convert the starting material into the same product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In both cases, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the four groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these groups, which might change due to the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Starting Acid (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH, the ester group takes priority because the oxygen of the alkoxy group (-OiBu) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    2.  **-CH₂COOH** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Acid): **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Product Lactone (at C4):**\n    The four groups attached to C4 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two fragments of the ring: -CH₂-C(=O)O- (let's call it A') and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (let's call it B').\n    *   Fragment A' is derived from the original -CH₂COOH group.\n    *   Fragment B' is derived from the original -CH₂COOiBu group.\n    1.  **-CH₂-C(=O)O- (A')** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing fragments A' and B', we look down their chains. In A', C4 is attached to C3, which is attached to C2. C2 is part of the C=O group and is bonded to two oxygens. In B', C4 is attached to C5, which is attached to C6. C6 is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, A' has higher priority.\n    2.  **-CH₂-CH₂-O- (B')** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Lactone): **-CH₂-C(=O)O- > -CH₂-CH₂-O- > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    Let's compare the priorities before and after the reaction:\n    *   The group that was **P1** in the acid (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes fragment B' in the lactone, which is **P2**.\n    *   The group that was **P2** in the acid (-CH₂COOH) becomes fragment A' in the lactone, which is **P1**.\n    The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap between any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the stereochemical configuration** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ → **(R)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ → **(S)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material B must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of cyclic ester is called a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, and the carbonyl carbon is position 2. Therefore, the ethyl group is at the carbon in the gamma (γ) position relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 4 is bonded to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different parts of the ring), making it a chiral center. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of delta-hydroxy carboxylic acids (5-hydroxy carboxylic acids). The precursor for our product must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C-3, which becomes C-4 in the final lactone product. The stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained during this cyclization.\n\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH   --(H+, heat)-->   (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) + H₂O\n    (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)                 (δ-lactone)\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n*   It has two carboxyl-type functional groups: one is a free **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and the other is an **isobutyl ester** (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   It has an ethyl group at position 3, which is the chiral center.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl.\n\nThis starting material has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key to solving the problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(LiBH₄)-->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(BH₃)-->   HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction steps do not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as that of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone). The structure is named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with the stereochemistry at the C4 position specified as either (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group at C2, and an ethyl group at the C4 chiral center.\n*   **Formation:** Such a lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid. In this specific case, the open-chain precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-CH₂OH(C5)\n    The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The chiral center in the starting dicarboxylic acid derivative is at C3. After the reaction and cyclization, this C3 becomes the C4 of the lactone. We must track the stereochemistry from C3 of the reactant to C4 of the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1 (A -> Product):** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones but does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2 (B -> Product):** BH₃ (Borane). BH₃ is a selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH₄)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting molecule, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the configuration at the chiral center is retained or inverted. Let's assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, C4 in the product).\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        - Comparing -CH₂COOH and -CH₂COOiBu: The -COOiBu group has higher priority because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in -COOH, the corresponding oxygen is attached to a hydrogen.\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The chiral center C4 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂-C(=O)O- (part of the ring towards C2), and -CH₂CH₂O- (part of the ring towards O1).\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped during the reaction sequence. A swap in priorities of two groups leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Determining A:** The product of Reaction 1 is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction causes an inversion, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH₃)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COOiBu) untouched.\n    B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺), where the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Let's analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        - (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        - (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is attacked during cyclization and becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (group 1 remains group 1, group 2 remains group 2). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration (R remains R, and S remains S).\n4.  **Determining B:** The product of Reaction 2 is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction proceeds with retention, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms.\n*   The carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 (adjacent to the ring oxygen).\n*   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is at position 4.\n*   The stereocenter is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a precursor molecule: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\nThe hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring. The chiral center is at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the resulting lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nAll options propose the same base structure for starting materials A and B: **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\nThe structure is: iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end.\n*   An isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other end.\nThe chiral center is at C3, which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is known to reduce esters more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids (which first deprotonate to form a less reactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the **ester** group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left largely unreacted.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the final lactonization step.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3), its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a classic reagent used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction must also produce the same lactone structure, which means it must also proceed through the **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** intermediate. Let's see how.\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is left untouched. The initial product is isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate (HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu).\n    2.  The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (\"+ H+\"). In this context, the acidic conditions will not only process the borane intermediates but also catalyze the **hydrolysis** of the isobutyl ester back to a carboxylic acid.\n    3.  The hydrolysis of the hydroxy-ester yields **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  This hydroxy-acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, none of the steps in this sequence affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products and Reactions\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a chiral center at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Formation of the Lactone:** A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required here is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5) --(H+)--> Lactone + H2O`\n    *   The chiral center in the hydroxy acid is at C3. Upon cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry at this center is preserved during lactonization.\n\n### 2. Deduce the Structure of the Starting Material\n\n*   The starting material must be a precursor to 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The reactions involve selective reduction of one of two carbonyl groups. This implies the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative.\n*   The parent acid is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid): `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has a chiral center at C3.\n*   The options provide the name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is somewhat ambiguous, it clearly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The structure of the starting material (A and B) is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and an isobutyl ester group, separated by a three-carbon chain containing the chiral center.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reducing Agents\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### 4. Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH4 reduces the ester group of starting material A.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (A) --LiBH4--> HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (Hydroxy Acid)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** We need to compare the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center before and after the reduction to see if the R/S designation changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups at the chiral center are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Acid Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOH` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in A (`-CH2COOiBu`) becomes the group with Priority 2 in the hydroxy acid (`-CH2CH2OH`).\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in A (`-CH2COOH`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the hydroxy acid.\n    *   This swap in the ranking of the top two priority groups causes an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy acid cyclizes to the lactone. A comparison of the CIP priorities for the chiral center in the hydroxy acid and the final lactone shows that the priority order is preserved. Therefore, the configuration does not change during this step.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The overall transformation is (S)-A → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### 5. Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of starting material B.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (B) --BH3--> HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (Hydroxy Ester)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Ester Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2CH2OH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in B (`-CH2COOiBu`) remains Priority 1 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in B (`-CH2COOH`) is reduced to `-CH2CH2OH`, which becomes Priority 2 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The priority ranking of the groups (P1 > P2 > P3) is **preserved**. Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor does **not** change (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy ester cyclizes to the lactone, and this step also preserves the stereochemistry.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The overall transformation is (S)-B → (S)-Hydroxy Ester → (S)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Therefore, A and B are the same compound.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester), also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing O(1), C(2)=O, C(3), C(4)-Et, C(5), C(6).\n    *   This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this open-chain precursor is at C3.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). Specifically, it's **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3 and contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe problem involves reducing the starting material, which has two reducible groups, with two different selective reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n    *   The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is preserved.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the same lactone product.\n    *   Again, the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, preserving its spatial arrangement.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in how the R/S designation changes (or doesn't change) due to the change in chemical groups attached to the chiral center. The R/S designation depends on the priority of the substituents.\n\n**Priorities in the Starting Material (A and B):**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral carbon C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority, since the ester carbon is considered bonded to three oxygens, one of which is further attached to a carbon)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority, as the carboxyl carbon is bonded to three oxygens, one of which is attached to hydrogen. C > H)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n*   `A` → Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) → `(R)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂CH₂OH` and `-CH₂COOH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOH` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group becomes the new Priority 2 group, and the original Priority 2 group becomes the new Priority 1 group. The priorities of the top two substituents are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   Therefore, to obtain an `(R)`-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   `(S)`-A → `(R)`-Intermediate → `(R)`-Lactone\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n*   `B` → Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) → `(S)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group remains the new Priority 1 group.

Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 (next to the oxygen, which is at position 1).\n*   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at position 4.\nThis structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone). Lactones are cyclic esters formed from the intramolecular reaction of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the open-chain precursor. Breaking the ester bond of the lactone gives 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereocenter at C4 of the lactone corresponds to the stereocenter at C3 of this hydroxy acid.\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not readily reduce carboxylic acids or, more accurately, their carboxylate salts which form in the basic medium of the hydride reagent.\n*   **Pathway:** To form the required precursor, (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, the reaction must start with a molecule that has a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The LiBH₄ must reduce the ester to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) intact.\n*   **Deduce Starting Material A:** Let's look at the structure provided in the options: \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the IUPAC name is non-standard, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl.\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1.\n    *   The isobutyl ester is at C5.\n    *   The stereocenter is at C3.\n    When this compound (A) is treated with LiBH₄, the ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, while the carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    This product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which is the correct precursor.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of A:** The reduction and subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority of the groups around the chiral center does not change. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent with the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Product:** The product is the (S)-enantiomer of the lactone from Reaction 1. This implies that the starting material B should be the (S)-enantiomer of A.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of B:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Acknowledge the Mechanistic Discrepancy (for completeness)**\n\nThere is a known inconsistency in the problem statement regarding Reaction 2.\n*   If we take B = (S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu and react it with BH₃, the carboxylic acid at C1 would be reduced.\n*   This would yield HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (isobutyl 6-hydroxy-4-ethylhexanoate).\n*   Upon acidic workup, this intermediate would cyclize to form a 7-membered lactone (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered δ-lactone stated in the problem.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, it's highly probable that this is a flaw in the question's design. The intended logic is for the student to use the known selectivity of the reagents and the principle of stereochemical retention to match the starting materials to the products.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of Reaction 1 and the stereochemical relationship between the products of the two reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product for both reactions, after workup, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is non-standard, it clearly describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nLet's draw the structure and number the carbon chain:\n\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n  1    2     3     4       5\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at C1.\n*   An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-iBu) at C5.\n\nThe molecule also has a chiral center at C3, where the ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids under normal conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters as well, but much more slowly than carboxylic acids.\n\nTherefore, the two reactions will selectively reduce opposite ends of the starting molecule.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (This is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1) in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This closes the ring to form a six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at C1 and C5, which are not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry at C3 is preserved. The chiral center at C3 in the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. The configuration ((R) or (S)) does not change.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The product of this reaction is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be the (R) enantiomer**.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (This is a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) from the reduced C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester (C5) in an intramolecular transesterification reaction. Isobutanol (iBu-OH) is eliminated, and the ring closes to form the same six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: Similar to the first reaction, the reactions occur away from the chiral center (C3). The configuration is preserved. The C3 stereocenter of the starting material becomes the C4 stereocenter of the product.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The product of this reaction is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be the (S) enantiomer**.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Product**\n\n    1.  **Product Structure**: The product in both reactions is a lactone (cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group. The chiral center is at carbon-4, which has an ethyl group attached. The (R) or (S) designation refers to the stereochemistry at this carbon.\n\n    2.  **Lactone Formation**: Six-membered lactones (δ-lactones) are formed from 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n        Upon cyclization (intramolecular esterification), the chiral center at C-3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C-4 of the lactone. The stereochemical configuration is retained during this step.\n\n    3.  **Starting Material Structure**: The options provided are all named `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name, though slightly unconventional, describes a molecule that is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n        The structure is:\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n        This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a chiral center at carbon-3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n    1.  **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n        *   **Reagent**: LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more reactive than NaBH4 but less so than LiAlH4.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n        *   **Reaction Path for A**:\n            a.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n            b.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged (after workup).\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material. Since the product is (R), the starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    2.  **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH3 (Borane)**\n        *   **Reagent**: BH3 (borane) is a highly selective reducing agent.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: BH3 is notable for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both functional groups, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Reaction Path for B**:\n            a.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with BH3.\n            b.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic ester (lactone). The final product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry of the product is dictated by the starting material. Since the product is (S), the starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n    *   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. It has an ethyl group at position 4, and the stereocenter at this position has the (R) configuration. Such a lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid, specifically (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of Product 1, with the stereocenter at position 4 having the (S) configuration. It is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone.\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones to alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards esters.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are all mono-isobutyl esters of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). This molecule has two different carboxylic acid functional groups that can be modified. One end can be a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other can be an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nThe parent diacid is HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(5). The chiral center is at C3.\n\nFor the reaction to produce a 6-membered lactone (a pyranone ring), the starting material must be a derivative of a 5-hydroxypentanoic acid. Let's analyze the structure of the starting material. The name in the options, \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid,\" although non-standard, implies a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at C1 and an isobutyl ester at C5.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)**\n\nLet's see if this structure works for both reactions:\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1: Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group at C5, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The product of the reduction is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, which are not the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration at C3.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2: Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group at C1, leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   The product of the reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1, displacing isobutanol and forming the same 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2. This is a saturated cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the carbon at position 4 (C4).\n\nThe lactone is formed by an intramolecular esterification reaction of a 5-hydroxypentanoic acid derivative. The carbon skeleton of the linear precursor must have an ethyl group that corresponds to the C4 position in the product. The precursor is therefore a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n*   This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups:\n    1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at one end.\n    2.  An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-iBu) at the other end.\n*   It has one chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the carbon bearing the ethyl group. The reactions do not involve this chiral center, so its stereochemistry will be preserved in the product. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). We need to determine its selectivity.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions. The carboxylic acid first reacts with the hydride in an acid-base reaction to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `(Stereoisomer of A)` HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  ---(LiBH₄)-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the existing carboxylic acid group and the newly formed alcohol group to form the δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the non-chiral ester end of the molecule. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A at C3 is the same as the stereochemistry of the product at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4.

We need to determine its selectivity.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃:** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. This reaction is much faster than the reduction of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group** to a primary alcohol.

The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the δ-lactone and releasing isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the non-chiral carboxylic acid end of the molecule. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material B at C3 is the same as the stereochemistry of the product at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5.

This makes the molecule a cyclic ester, specifically a **lactone**.\n*   **delta-Lactone**: Because it's a six-membered ring lactone, it is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon atom bearing the ethyl group.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O=C(2)---C(3)H2\n       /         \\\n     O(1)         C(4)H-Et\n       \\         /\n      C(6)H2---C(5)H2\n```\nThis delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a **delta-hydroxy acid** (a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n\nLet's determine the structure of the open-chain hydroxy acid precursor by conceptually breaking the ester bond (O1-C2). The C2 carbonyl becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the O1 atom (which is attached to C6) becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nThe resulting open-chain precursor is:\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH**\n\nThis molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this acid corresponds to the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter's configuration.\n\nTherefore:\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Although the IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is converted into an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n**HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThis starting material has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COO-iBu)\n\nThe reactions use two different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids**. It reduces them much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) of starting material A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) protonates any intermediates and catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and do not involve the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of starting material B is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COO-iBu) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe name \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group in a position that forms a cyclic ester (lactone). Specifically, this is a δ-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the specific precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)** --- (cyclization) ---> **(4-ethyl)-lactone**\n\nCrucially, the cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center (C3 in the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore:\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (R)-lactone.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options describe the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is best interpreted as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The most plausible structure that fits the name and reactions is:\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)**\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n        **A** (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) --- (LiBH₄) ---> **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH**\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes (with acid catalysis, H⁺) to form the 6-membered δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center. The cyclization also does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must have been the (R)-hydroxyacid, which in turn must have come from starting material **A** with the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options (A) and (D).\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the reduction process does not involve the chiral center, so its configuration should be conserved. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Note:** There is a discrepancy in the problem statement for this reaction. The reduction of the carboxylic acid in B would yield `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. Cyclization of this molecule would form a 7-membered ring (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered ring (δ-lactone) specified. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is most likely an error in the problem's text. The most reliable line of reasoning is to follow the conservation of stereochemistry, which is a fundamental principle. The transformation from an (S) starting material to an (S) product is stereochemically sound.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to yield the (R)-product.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to yield the (S)-product.\n\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the chiral center is not involved in the reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (from options):** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1), an ester group at the other end (C5), and a chiral center at C3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    *   The chiral center is C3.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center.\n    *   Lactonization occurs by forming an ester linkage between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group at C5 and the carbonyl carbon at C1 of a pentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH₄. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, **LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with LiBH₄. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and isobutanol is released. The carboxylic acid at C1 remains (or is reformed during workup).\n        A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it is **very slow to react with esters**.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material B (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with BH₃. The carboxylic acid at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 remains intact.\n        B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of the resulting 5-hydroxy ester. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the bond-forming/breaking steps. Its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By IUPAC convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, so the carbonyl carbon is adjacent to it.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid.\n\nLet's draw the product and number the ring atoms according to IUPAC rules:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\n C(6)H2  C(2)=O\n |       |\nC(5)H2  C(3)H2\n \\      /\n   C(4)H-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are all stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon carboxylic acid chain.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The carboxyl group at C1 is a free acid (-COOH), while the carboxyl group at C5 has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2).\n\nThe structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it typically does not reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n    The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1. This is an intramolecular esterification, which forms a stable six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from C5-OH), C5, C4, C3, C2, C1(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. In the IUPAC name of the lactone product, this position is C4. So the product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization involves breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)-configuration**.\n*   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis eliminates options A and C.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: B\n*   **Reagents**: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH3) is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**. (Note: IUPAC naming starts from the ester C1, so the OH is on C5).\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group (originally from C1) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is an intramolecular transesterification, which also forms a six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from the new OH), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone also has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. As established before, this corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product. Thus, this reaction also produces 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)-configuration**.\n*   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products\n\nThe products of the two reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLet's understand the structure of this product. It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This confirms it's a lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   \"(R)\" or \"(S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThis lactone is a δ-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\nThe chiral center in the acid is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is a bit unconventional, it describes a molecule derived from 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has formed an ester with isobutanol.\n\nThe structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (where iBu = isobutyl group, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An ester (-COOiBu)\n\nThe chiral center is at the C3 position (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nNow, let's analyze the reagents and their selectivity. This is the crucial part of the problem.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains mostly untouched under typical conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly, while it reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce Starting Material A for Reaction 1\n\n**Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  ⟶  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This means the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Deduce Starting Material B for Reaction 2\n\n**Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  ⟶  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carboxylic acid carbon, which is not the chiral center. The configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration. This means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   The combination of these features describes a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n*   The molecule has a single chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n  H2C   C=O\n /   \\ /\nH2C--CH-CH2CH3\n   \\ /\n    CH2\n   (C4 has the chiral center)\n```\n*   Reaction 1 yields the `(R)` enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the `(S)` enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Immediate Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually hydrolyze the lactone by breaking the ester bond within the ring. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group to one end and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to the other.\n\nCleavage of the C2-O1 bond results in `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`:\n`HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nThe chiral center of this precursor acid is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product. The lactonization process does not change the stereochemistry at this chiral center.\n*   To form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   To form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Main chain:** pentanoic acid with a free COOH group at C1.\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at C3 and an isobutoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5.\nThe structure is: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis molecule possesses both an ester functional group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The chiral center is at C3, which will be preserved throughout the reactions.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent. We must consider its chemoselectivity.\n*   **Selectivity:** `LiBH4` readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. In a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) in compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    4.  This resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization (`H+` workup) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, to obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`) is another reducing agent.\n*   **Selectivity:** `BH3` is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. In a molecule with both groups, `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound B is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter is not affected by this sequence. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n*   Starting material B = `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a tetrahydropyran skeleton) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position. This is a cyclic ester, specifically a δ-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   This C4 carbon, being attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, and two different paths around the ring), is a chiral center.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nSix-membered (δ) lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids.\nThe structure of our lactone product implies its precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n`HO-CH₂(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone has the ethyl group at C4 (which corresponds to C3 of the acid precursor). The stereochemistry at this chiral center is not altered during the lactonization process. Therefore, an (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone, and an (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide isomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at the end of a five-carbon chain. Let's number the chain C1 to C5, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon.\n    `C(5)-C(4)-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)OOH`\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy`: This indicates that C5 has both an oxo (`=O`) and an isobutoxy (`-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) group. This combination describes an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`).\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is a pentanedioic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other (C5).\n\nStarting Material Structure: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)` (where the numbers in parentheses denote the position relative to the carboxylic acid C1). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutoxy part becomes isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged (as a lithium carboxylate salt).\n    3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) protonates the carboxylate back to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction produces `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the stereocenter at C3, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-CH₂OH(1)`.\n    4.  Under the reaction conditions (or during acidic workup), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** The attacking `OH` is on C1 (now `CH₂OH`) and the ester is at C5. This also results in the formation of the same `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` system which cyclizes. Let's trace the ring formation more carefully: the intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. The `OH` at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center at C3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   The product in both reactions is a derivative of \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom.\n*   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"-2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is at position 1. This structure is a cyclic ester, specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   This C4 atom is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the carbon chain forming the ring.\n*   The product of Reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of Reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options suggest the starting material is \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   Let's decode this name. It's a derivative of pentanedioic acid (also known as glutaric acid), which has the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group is on the central carbon (C3). The structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH.\n*   This C3 is a chiral center because it's attached to H, Et, -CH₂COOH, and another group. Let's see what that is.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\": This is a slightly non-standard name indicating that one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂). Numbering the pentanedioic acid chain from 1 to 5, the structure is a monoester:\n    HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)\n*   The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are: H, Ethyl, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Since these four groups are different, C3 is indeed a chiral center. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\n*   Both reactions involve a reduction followed by an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone ring. To form this ring, a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative) is needed as an intermediate.\n*   **Reaction 1 Reagent: LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**. LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. In the presence of both an ester and a carboxylic acid, it preferentially reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Reaction 2 Reagent: BH₃ (Borane)**. BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while it does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy acid. Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water and forming the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, no bonds to the chiral center (C3, which becomes C4 in the product) are broken or formed. Thus, the absolute 3D arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is retained.\n*   **However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituent groups changes.** Let's analyze this critical point.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups at C3 are H, Et, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Comparing -CH₂COOH and -CH₂COOiBu, the ester group has higher priority because the O is attached to a carbon (in iBu) while in the acid it's attached to H. So the priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** The groups at C4 are H, Et, -CH₂-C(=O)O- (from the original acid), and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (from the original ester). Comparing the two ring segments, the C next to the carbonyl is attached to three oxygens (by convention), while the C next to the ether oxygen is attached to one oxygen and two hydrogens. So the priority order is: (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂-CH₂-O- > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Starting Material Group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes Product Group 2.\n        *   Starting Material Group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes Product Group 1.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion of the R/S descriptor**. An (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces **(R)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material **A must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (B):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → (R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester. Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the lactone. This is an intramolecular transesterification.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the 3D arrangement at the chiral center is retained. Let's check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂-CH₂-O- > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Starting Material Group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes Product Group 1 (-CH₂-C(=O)O-).\n        *   Starting Material Group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes Product Group 2 (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   The priorities of the groups are **maintained**. This means the **R/S descriptor is retained**. An (S) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces **(S)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material **B must also be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **pyran-2-one**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at position 2, forming a lactone (a cyclic ester). The oxygen is at position 1.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   The structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the ring.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\nThe precursor to `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\nLet's verify this:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group (-OH) on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) on C1. The resulting ring consists of atoms C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and the oxygen from the C5-OH group. This forms a six-membered ring. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's determine its structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). The carboxyl carbon is C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) is at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes a substituent at C5. It's an isobutoxycarbonyl group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is an isobutyl ester.\n*   Combining these parts, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`.\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a chiral center at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does not readily reduce carboxylic acids (especially after deprotonation to the unreactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The reduction converts starting material A into `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate alkoxide and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction mechanism does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `BH₃` (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 remains largely unreacted under conditions where the acid is selectively reduced.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The problem states that the final product is a 6-membered lactone, which means the final precursor must be `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. To get from the hydroxy-ester intermediate to this hydroxy-acid, the ester group must be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis (`-COOiBu` → `-COOH`) occurs during the acidic workup (H⁺).\n    5.  The resulting `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final (S)-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: None of the steps in this proposed pathway (reduction of C1, hydrolysis of C5, lactonization) affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring). It's saturated (tetrahydro). There's a carbonyl group (ketone/one) at position 2. This structure is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The IUPAC numbering for lactones starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2. So the structure is an O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2 ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The two reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this product.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered delta-lactone, the precursor is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** (HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH). The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a non-standard IUPAC name, but it most plausibly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (also known as 3-ethylpentanedioic acid).\n*   **Structure**: iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\n*   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n*   It has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting diester-acid into the lactone. This requires reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and then inducing cyclization. The key to solving this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a strong, but selective, reducing agent. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the basic hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is much less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it does so much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**4. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: A = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group is mostly unreacted.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The acid workup (H+) protonates the intermediate carboxylate salt, yielding the hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This molecule then cyclizes (lactonizes), often promoted by the acidic conditions, to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: These reaction steps (reduction of a group away from the chiral center, lactonization) do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**5. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: B = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group is left intact.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The intermediate after reduction is a hydroxy-ester: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`. During the workup or upon heating, this molecule undergoes an intramolecular transesterification: the terminal -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in the first reaction, these steps do not affect the existing chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position, making it a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **\"tetrahydro-\"**: The ring is saturated.\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The C4 carbon, bearing the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The products are the specific enantiomers, (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\nLet's draw the general structure of the product:\n```\n      O        // The O is position 1, the C=O is C2\n     / \\\n  C(=O) CH2\n  /     \\\n CH2      CH-CH2CH3   // This is C4, the chiral center\n  \\     /\n   CH2\n```\nThe chirality at C4 determines if it's the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's decode this name to understand its structure.\n*   **\"pentanoic acid\"**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **\"3-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group at C3. This C3 is a chiral center.\n*   **\"5-oxo\" and \"5-isobutoxy\"**: This describes the group at C5. Together, they form an isobutyl ester, -C(=O)O-iBu.\nSo, the molecule has a carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other end. It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n```\n     HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O)O-iBu\n                 |\n               CH2CH3\n IUPAC numbering: C1   C2   C3    C4     C5\n```\nThe chiral center in the starting material is at C3. This chiral center corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone product. Since the reactions involved (reduction and cyclization) do not affect this stereocenter, the configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be the same as the configuration of the final product.\n\nThe two different reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids react with the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to further reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH₄. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**:\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[LiBH₄]-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    ```\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization)**: The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid and catalyzes intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The original chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is preserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: BH₃. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COOiBu) untouched.\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**:\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[BH₃]-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    ```\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization)**: The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl carbon to form the lactone ring, displacing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in reaction 1, the chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Its configuration is preserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, which is a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The two products are enantiomers, differing only in their stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe formation of this lactone implies that the starting material, upon selective reduction, yields a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The structure of this precursor must be `HO-(CH₂)₄-COOH` with an ethyl group at the appropriate position.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure and identify its key features:\n`isobutyl-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\nThis molecule has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`).\n*   A single chiral center at C3, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nThe lactone product is formed from an open-chain precursor `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which results from the reduction of either the ester or the carboxylic acid group. The C3 of the starting material corresponds to C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is key to solving the problem.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe outcome of each reaction depends on the selective action of the reducing agent:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much more rapidly than it reduces esters.\n\n### **4. Trace the Path of Each Reaction**\n\n#### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    `A (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the newly formed hydroxyl group (at C5) and the existing carboxylic acid group (at C1), forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the R/S configuration changes. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: `-CH₂-COOR` beats `-CH₂-COOH` because the isobutyl group is larger than H).*\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** After reduction and cyclization, the chiral center C4 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: The path `-CH₂-C(=O)-` has higher priority than `-CH₂-CH₂O-` because C is attached to (O,O,O) vs (O,H,H)).*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product, and the group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 1. This swapping of the top two priorities leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → S, S → R).\n    *   Since the product is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n    `B (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same priorities as for A.\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** The groups attached to the chiral center are the same as in Reaction 1, with the same priorities.\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material (`-CH₂-COOR`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`). The group that was Priority 2 (`-CH₂-COOH`) becomes Priority 2 (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). The relative priority order is unchanged. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → R, S → S).\n    *   Since the product is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n*   **Reaction 1:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reaction 2:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\nThe lactone product is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered lactone, this would be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (for reaction 1) or a hydroxy-ester that cyclizes via transesterification (for reaction 2).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The main chain has 5 carbons.\n*   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   The structure is: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(C5-C4)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)`\n*   The chiral center is C3, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents (Reducing Agents)**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. In the context of our starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group.\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `No reaction (or very slow)`\n\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has a different selectivity profile. It is excellent for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and does so faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `No reaction (or slow)`\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1: Starting Material A to (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n    *   Starting material A (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with LiBH₄.\n    *   The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup protonates the carboxylic acid, making it more electrophilic. The hydroxyl group at C5 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1), forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   This intramolecular esterification produces the lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) changes.\n    *   **In Starting Material (A):** The groups on C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. So, Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The acid group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Acid > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** During the reduction, the group that was priority #1 (ester) became priority #2 (alcohol), and the group that was priority #2 (acid) became priority #1. When the priorities of two groups on a chiral center are swapped, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) inverts.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2: Starting Material B to (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with BH₃**\n    *   Starting material B (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with BH₃.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester. Isobutanol is eliminated, forming the same lactone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In Starting Material (B):** Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Ester > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** In this reaction, the original priority #1 group (ester) remains #1. The original priority #2 group (acid) becomes the new priority #2 group (alcohol). The overall priority ranking of the four substituents **does not change**.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   To get an **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material to produce the respective products.\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) and Borane (`BH3`), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing `O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-`.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n    *   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   It has a chiral center at position 3, the carbon with the ethyl group. This chiral center will become position 4 in the final lactone product. The reactions described (reduction and cyclization) do not alter the stereochemistry at this center.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n1.  **Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It can reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**, but it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n2.  **Borane (`BH3`)**: This reducing agent has a unique and high selectivity for **carboxylic acids**, reducing them to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters, especially in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`LiBH4`)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Cyclization (Lactonization):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid undergoes an intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) must be the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`BH3`)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization (Transesterification):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl carbon, displacing the isobutoxy group (`-OiBu`) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (B) must match that of the product. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selectivity of different reducing agents and the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product and starting materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It has a single stereocenter at the 4-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options provided are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It has a single stereocenter at the 3-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will *not* reduce the -COOH group but *will* reduce the -COOiBu group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C-5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).

The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration of the starting material at C-3 is retained in the final product at C-4.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a reducing agent.

Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a single chiral center at position 4, which has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of the first product, with an (S) configuration at the chiral center.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid. To form a six-membered ring lactone, the precursor must be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options provided are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n*   The parent chain is a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end.\n*   At the other end (position 5), there is an \"isobutoxy-oxo\" group, which describes an isobutyl ester group: -C(=O)O-iBu.\n*   There is an ethyl group at position 3.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\nLet's draw the structure:\nHOOC(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(Et)(3) - CH₂(4) - C(=O)O-iBu(5)\n\nThis molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is specified as either (R) or (S) in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThis problem hinges on the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester group**.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\nNow, let's trace the two reaction pathways.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (A):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  →  (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The intermediate is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (B):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  →  (R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The name indicates an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 position is a chiral center, and the products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Formation of a Delta-Lactone:** A delta-lactone is typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of this precursor would be HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). The hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at position 3.\n    *   It is a mono-ester. One carboxylic acid group is free, while the other is an isobutyl ester. By IUPAC naming conventions for acids, the free carboxylic acid carbon is C1.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   The key feature of this starting material is that it has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities.\n\n**Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in the given starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + isobutanol\n    The product of the reduction is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction A:** The product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

It selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product of this reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing the isobutanol and forming the same six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemistry happens at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is retained.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material B must have had the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4.

A more systematic name is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid 5-isobutyl ester or 4-(isobutoxycarbonyl)-3-ethylbutanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is selective for esters over carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Step-by-step reaction**:\n        a. Starting material A must be the (R) or (S) isomer of `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`.\n        b. LiBH₄ reduces the ester at C5: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.

This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The IUPAC name indicates the oxygen is at position 1, the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2, and an ethyl group is at position 4. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n    ```\n        CH2(6)--CH2(5)\n       /          \\\n      O(1)        *CH(Et)(4)\n       \\          /\n        C(2)(=O)--CH2(3)\n    ```\n    *   This lactone is formed from a linear 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid through intramolecular esterification (lactonization).\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n    *   Note that the chiral carbon C3 in the open-chain acid becomes the chiral carbon C4 in the lactone. The reaction does not involve bond changes at this chiral center, so the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained.\n\n*   **Starting Materials (Options):** The options propose stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    The chiral center is at C3.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. In the presence of a carboxylic acid, it first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is then resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is deprotonated.\n        `A (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`LiBH4`---> `Li⁺ ⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to give the carboxylic acid.\n        `⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` ---`H⁺`---> `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n        `B (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`BH3`---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) is used to process the intermediate borate esters and also catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the pair of compounds listed in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group (a δ-lactone or oxan-2-one). The stereocenter is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is slightly ambiguous, the most chemically sensible structure for this name is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has a single stereocenter at carbon-3, the one bearing the ethyl group. This stereocenter is what determines if the starting material is (R) or (S). This C3 in the starting material will become the C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + `LiBH₄` + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `LiBH₄`.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    4.  The final product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 1:** We need to determine if the configuration at the stereocenter is retained or inverted. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At C3 of the Starting Material:** The substituents are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (Group 1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Group 2).\n        *   Comparing Group 1 and Group 2, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) because the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen. So, Priority: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **At C4 of the Product Lactone:** The substituents are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring portion, from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring portion, from the original ester).\n        *   Comparing the ring portions, the one containing the carbonyl group has higher priority. So, Priority: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > `-Et` > `-H`.\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**. (R) becomes (S), and (S) becomes (R).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + `BH₃` + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent that exhibits the opposite selectivity to `LiBH₄`. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `BH₃`.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the same six-membered lactone ring.\n    4.

Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same compound. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The product name is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n*   **Pyran**: Indicates a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Numbering in such heterocycles starts with the oxygen as position 1 and proceeds towards the carbonyl group.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n*   **(R)/(S)**: Specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. Such lactones are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor.\n\nBreaking the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone gives the hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\nLet's name this precursor acid. The main chain has 5 carbons with a carboxylic acid group, so it is a pentanoic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxylic carbon (C1).\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\nThe name is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nWhen this hydroxy acid cyclizes, the C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone is directly inherited from the hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an acid-ester:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nNumbering from the free acid group (C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent that is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones but **does not reduce carboxylic acids** (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The reduction at C5 does not affect the chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of starting material A is passed on to the hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must be `(R)`. This requires the starting material A to have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis finding eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`, often used as `BH3-THF`) is also a reducing agent, but with a different selectivity compared to `LiBH4`. `BH3` selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The reduction at C1 does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of B is passed on to the hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, causing cyclization to form the same lactone structure and release isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must be `(S)`. This requires the starting material B to have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material Options:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has a chiral center at carbon-3.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu).\n    *   The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (`-CH(Et)-`). The reactions happen at the ends of the molecule, so the stereochemistry at this carbon is expected to be retained throughout the reaction sequence. However, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) designation (R or S) may change if the relative priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n    *   The lactone is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The `-OH` group at C-5 reacts with the `-COOH` group at C-1 to form the six-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C-4, which corresponds to C-3 in the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nBoth reactions involve a selective reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups, followed by an acid-catalyzed cyclization (lactonization).\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Reagent is **LiBH₄** (Lithium borohydride).\n    *   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids (which react much more slowly).\n    *   So, `LiBH₄` will reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Reagent is **BH₃** (Borane).\n    *   `BH₃` is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    *   So, `BH₃` will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and CIP Priority Changes**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the reactions affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, which determines the R/S designation.\n\n1.  **Priorities in the Starting Material (SM):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH (Acid chain), and -CH₂COO-iBu (Ester chain).\n    *   By CIP rules, H is priority 4. Comparing the other three groups:\n        *   The ester chain (-CH₂COO-iBu) has higher priority than the acid chain (-CH₂COOH).\n        *   Both the ester and acid chains have higher priority than the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   So, the priority order is: **P1: -CH₂COO-iBu > P2: -CH₂COOH > P3: -Et > P4: H**.\n\n2.  **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C4) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the carbonyl side of the ring (-CH₂-C=O), and the ether side of the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   By CIP rules, the priority order is: **New P1: -CH₂-C=O > New P2: -CH₂-CH₂-O- > New P3: -Et > New P4: H**.\n\n3.  **Trace the Priority Changes for Each Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The two highest priority groups have swapped their priority labels (Old P1 → New P2, Old P2 → New P1). A single swap of priorities inverts the stereochemical designation.\n        *   Therefore, an (S)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (R)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(R)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The priority labels are maintained (Old P1 → New P1, Old P2 → New P2). There is no swap.\n        *   Therefore, the stereochemical designation is retained. An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(S)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product Structure\n\nBoth reactions produce an enantiomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   **\"pyran\"**: Indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **\"tetrahydro...-2-one\"**: This specifies a saturated six-membered ring with a carbonyl group at position 2, adjacent to the ring oxygen (position 1). This is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the lactone ring.\n*   The structure is chiral, with the stereocenter at carbon 4.\n\nThe structure of the lactone ring is:\n`O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2-`\n\nA lactone is a cyclic ester, typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy carboxylic acid. To form this specific six-membered lactone, the precursor must be a **5-hydroxy acid**. Hydrolysis (breaking the ester bond) of the product gives its hydroxy acid precursor:\n`HO-C(6)H2-C(5)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(3)H2-C(2)(=O)-OH`\nIf we renumber this as a standard carboxylic acid chain (starting from the -COOH group), it is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\nThe stereocenter in this hydroxy acid is C3. Lactonization does not affect this stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry at C4 of the lactone product directly corresponds to the stereochemistry at C3 of its hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options propose that the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's interpret this chemical name. It describes a derivative of `pentanoic acid` (a 5-carbon carboxylic acid). The `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy` substituents describe an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at the end of the chain.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Let's draw the structure, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n*   This molecule is chiral at C3 because the two groups attached to it (`-CH2COOH` and `-CH2COOiBu`) are different.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the given reducing agents react with this starting material.\n\n**Reaction A: Treatment with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is effective at reducing esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It is much less reactive towards carboxylates (the deprotonated form of carboxylic acids). Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the **ester** group.\n*   **Reaction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`. This is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C5 (the ester) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction A:**\n    *   Starting Material `A` reacts with `LiBH₄` to produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `A` must be the **(R)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**Reaction B: Treatment with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   `BH₃` is a reducing agent that has a strong and well-known selectivity for reducing **carboxylic acids** in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOCH₂(from C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl group, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone. Let's trace the ring formation: the oxygen from the original C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon C5. This forms a ring containing O(from C1), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 - a six-membered ring.\n*   **Resulting Lactone Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the same structural skeleton as in Reaction A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C1 (the acid) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction B:**\n    *   Starting Material `B` reacts with `BH₃` to produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `B` must be the **(S)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reduction reactions leading to stereoisomeric products. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The full name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This means it's a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    The structure is: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group. This chiral center can have an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a δ-lactone (a 6-membered cyclic ester).\n    *   The reaction involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) that forms the 6-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. The reaction yields either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.

Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules assign the (R)/(S) designation and how this assignment changes (or doesn't) during each reaction.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material (SM):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two main chains, the ester chain has higher priority than the acid chain because at the first point of difference (the oxygen atom), it's bonded to a carbon (of isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-COOR` (P1) > `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Product (Lactone):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (carbonyl side of the lactone ring)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (oxygen side of the lactone ring)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two ring fragments, the one containing the carbonyl group (`-C(=O)`) has higher priority than the one with the single-bonded oxygen (`-CH₂O-`).\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P1') > `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (P2') > `-Et` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n\n*   **Connecting SM to Product:**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The high-priority ester group in A (`-CH₂COOR`, P1) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the low-priority oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`, P2').\n        *   The low-priority acid group in A (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`, P1').\n        *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P2', P2 → P1').

Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone. Let's deconstruct the product name: \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran system) and a ketone (carbonyl group) at the 2-position. When a carbonyl is part of a heterocyclic ring next to the heteroatom, it signifies a lactone (cyclic ester). A six-membered lactone is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **\"tetrahydro\"**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **\"(R)\" or \"(S)\"**: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the carbon at position 4 (the one bearing the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\nCH2(6)   C(2)=O\n |        |\nCH2(5)   CH2(3)\n \\      /\n  CH(4)-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\nReaction A produces the (R)-enantiomer.\nReaction B produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   This name, though not strictly IUPAC compliant, describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Structure of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH. The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (C3).\n*   The starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of this diacid. This means one of the two carboxylic acid groups has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n*   Let's assume the esterification occurred on the carboxylic group further from the ethyl substituent. The structure would be:\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-CH2CH(CH3)2`\n    This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The stereochemistry (R/S) is at the C3 position.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The ester group of starting material A is reduced by LiBH4 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --LiBH4-->  HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, eliminating a water molecule and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the final lactone product (C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone).\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B: Reduction with BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: BH3 (Borane) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group of starting material B is reduced by BH3 to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --BH3-->  HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group, displacing the isobutoxy group (which becomes isobutanol) and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the original stereocenter at C3. C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry is conserved.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Products:** Both reactions produce a chiral lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The products are enantiomers of each other:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (a δ-lactone). The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4 of the ring. This C4 atom is the stereocenter.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting materials are enantiomers of a compound named \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.\n    *   This name is best interpreted as a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   Specifically, it's the mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is: `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. (where `iBu` is isobutyl, `(CH₃)₂CHCH₂-`).\n    *   This molecule possesses two different functional groups: an **ester** (`-COO-iBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`).\n    *   Crucially, the carbon at position 3, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COO-iBu.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent with specific selectivity. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but typically **does not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material `A` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` --(LiBH₄)--> `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n    3.  In the presence of acid (H⁺ from workup), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable 6-membered δ-lactone. The hydroxyl group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid at the other end.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The chiral center in the starting material (C3 of the chain) is not directly involved in the reduction or the cyclization. No bonds to this chiral center are made or broken.\n    *   During cyclization, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   Since the chiral center is unaffected, its stereochemical configuration is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but **does not** readily reduce esters. This selectivity is complementary to LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material `B` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` --(BH₃)--> `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺), this molecule undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the same 6-membered δ-lactone as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Similar to Reaction 1, the chiral center (C3 of the chain, which becomes C4 of the lactone) is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The stereochemical configuration is retained.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. \"-2-one\" means there's a carbonyl group at the C2 position (next to the ring oxygen, O1). \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at position C4.\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a stereocenter. The product of reaction 1 has the (R) configuration, and the product of reaction 2 has the (S) configuration.\n\nThis lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a specific hydroxy acid. By mentally opening the ester bond, we can identify this precursor: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH  <-- (H+ catalysis) --> (4-ethyl)-lactone + H2O\n```\n\nNotice that the stereocenter in the hydroxy acid is at C3. During lactonization, this carbon becomes C4 in the lactone. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nOur goal is to figure out how starting materials A and B are converted into this key hydroxy acid intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This is a monoester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   The structure has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is on C3.\n*   Structure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂**\n*   The stereocenter is at C3, the same carbon that will become the stereocenter in the final product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  This transformation yields **HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH**, which is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This is the exact precursor needed for the lactone.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The entire reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. BH₃ selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate after reduction is **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) has two functions here. First, it protonates the intermediates from the borane reduction. Second, under aqueous acidic conditions, it will also hydrolyze the remaining isobutyl ester group back into a carboxylic acid.\n    5.  Hydrolysis of the intermediate gives **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(at C5)**. This molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**, the same key precursor as in Reaction 1.\n    6.  The H⁺ also catalyzes the final cyclization to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the stereocenter is not affected by any of the reaction steps. The configuration is retained from the start to the end.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** Both reactions produce 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). This molecule has a single stereocenter at the C4 position, where the ethyl group is attached. The two reactions yield the two possible enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids (or hydroxy esters). A six-membered ring lactone (delta-lactone) like this one is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivative. Specifically, the precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or an ester thereof). The stereocenter in this precursor is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The cyclization step itself does not alter the configuration of the stereocenter. Therefore:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's draw this structure. The name indicates a pentanoic acid backbone with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at C1, and an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5. There is an ethyl group at the C3 stereocenter.\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n*   This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester. It has two different carbonyl functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters and aldehydes/ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. In our starting material, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester group** at C5 to a primary alcohol.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The reduction doesn't break any bonds at the C3 stereocenter, so its absolute 3D arrangement is preserved.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    5.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:** This is the crucial part. We need to see if the stereochemical descriptor (R or S) changes during the transformation from starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid):** The four groups attached to the C3 stereocenter are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `H` (P4)\n        (The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. C > H).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOiBu` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups at C3 are now H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (P'1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P'2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P'3)\n        4.  `H` (P'4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** The group that was priority 1 (P1) in the starting material becomes priority 2 (P'2) in the intermediate. The group that was priority 2 (P2) becomes priority 1 (P'1) in the intermediate. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This **inverts** the R/S descriptor. For example, if we start with the (S)-enantiomer of A, the intermediate formed will be the (R)-enantiomer of the hydroxy acid.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction produces the (R)-lactone, it must have come from the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate. To get the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate, we must start with the **(S)-starting material A**.\n    *   (S)-A ---> (R)-hydroxy acid ---> (R)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **5. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:**\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material B:** Same as for A: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOH` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P''1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P''2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P''3)\n        4.  `H` (P''4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** Let's compare the priority order of the groups before and after the reaction. The starting material P1 group is still the highest priority group (P''1). The starting material P2 group is reduced, and the resulting group has priority P''2. The P3 group remains P''3. The priority order of the groups does not change (i.e., the group derived from P1 is still higher than the group from P2, which is still higher than the group from P3). Therefore, the R/S descriptor is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction produces the (S)-lactone, it must have come from the (S)-hydroxy ester intermediate. Since the configuration is retained in this reaction, we must start with the **(S)-starting material B**.\n    *   (S)-B ---> (S)-hydroxy ester ---> (S)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center (stereocenter) is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C -- O\n     /      \\\n    CH2      CH-Et   <-- Chiral center at C4\n    |        |\n    CH2 --- CH2\n    ```\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically a mono-isobutyl ester. The structure for \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is:\n\n    ```\n        O                  O\n       //                 //\n    HO--C--CH2--CH(Et)--CH2--C--O-isobutyl\n                       ^\n                       |\n                  Chiral center\n    ```\n    This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the different reactivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form H₂ gas and a lithium carboxylate salt (-COO⁻ Li⁺), which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is the opposite of LiBH₄'s. Borane reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly and efficiently. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction is significantly slower than the reduction of carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Trace the Reaction Pathways and Stereochemistry**\n\nNeither of the reduction steps (converting -COOH or -COOR to -CH₂OH) nor the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) involves breaking any bonds at the chiral center (the carbon with the ethyl group). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be directly retained in the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (it exists as a carboxylate salt).\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --LiBH₄-->  (Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺`\n    2.  **Workup & Cyclization:** Acid workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to form a hydroxy-carboxylic acid.

Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, with either (R) or (S) stereochemistry. Let's break down this name:\n*   `pyran`: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   `tetrahydro- ... -2-one`: It is a saturated ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. This specific structure, a cyclic ester, is called a lactone. Because it's a 6-membered ring, it's a delta-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   `(R)` or `(S)`: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\nLet's identify the specific hydroxy acid precursor for `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   The lactone ring is O¹-C²(=O)-C³H₂-C⁴H(Et)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₂.\n*   If we conceptually \"open\" the ester bond (between O¹ and C²), we get a carboxylic acid at C² and a hydroxyl group at C⁶.\n*   The open-chain precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`.\n*   Note that the chiral center in the acid is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone. Therefore, cyclization of `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will yield `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, and the `(S)` acid will yield the `(S)` lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\nLet's decode this name:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center.\n*   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: This describes the group at C5. It's a combination of a carbonyl (`oxo`) and an isobutoxy group, which indicates an isobutyl ester (`-COO-isobutyl`).\nSo, the structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n\nThe two reducing agents show different chemoselectivity:\n*   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride): A relatively mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids because it first deprotonates them to form a very unreactive carboxylate anion.\n*   `BH₃` (Borane): A powerful reducing agent that is particularly effective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much more reactive towards carboxylic acids than esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) untouched.\n    *   `A` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOOC...CH(Et)...CH₂OH`\n*   This intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) causes this hydroxy-acid to cyclize into the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material `A` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must be `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) untouched.\n    *   `B` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOCH₂...CH(Et)...COOR`\n*   The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed `-OH` group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   Let's verify the ring size. The intermediate is `HO-CH₂¹⁻CH₂²-CH(Et)³-CH₂⁴-C(=O)⁵OR`. The attacking oxygen (from C1) and the carbons C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 form the ring. This is a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction happens at the achiral end of the molecule, and the cyclization does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of the starting material `B` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must be `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and Borane (BH3), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the products are enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone).\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A or B):** The name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's deduce its structure. It's a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end. At the other end (C5), there is an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu). An ethyl group is attached at C3. This carbon (C3) is a stereocenter.\n    Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    The stereocenter at C3 is what determines if the molecule is (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Product:** The name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4. This carbon (C4) is a stereocenter, and it corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n    Structure: A six-membered ring with an oxygen atom (O1) and a carbonyl group at the adjacent position (C2). An ethyl group is on C4.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding that the reactions occur at the functional groups (carboxylic acid and ester) but **do not affect the stereocenter**. The C-H and C-C bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material) are not broken or formed. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is directly retained in the product. An (R) starting material will produce an (R) product, and an (S) starting material will produce an (S) product.\n\nNow let's examine each reaction path:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. When reacting with a molecule that has both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it exhibits selectivity. LiBH₄ is basic and will first deprotonate the acidic carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate anion is electron-rich and thus resistant to reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (`H⁻`). The ester group, however, remains electrophilic and is readily reduced by LiBH₄ to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu` (Deprotonation)\n    2.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH` (Ester reduction)\n    3.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH + H⁺` → `HOOC-R-CH₂OH` (Protonation)\n    This final molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids spontaneously cyclize via intramolecular esterification to form a stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As the reaction does not involve the chiral center, its configuration is retained. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent highly selective for carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + BH₃` → `HOCH₂-R-COO-iBu` (Carboxylic acid reduction to a primary alcohol)\n    The result is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The H⁺ in the workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction occurs away from the chiral center, so its configuration is retained. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "This problem requires a detailed understanding of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents (`LiBH₄` and `BH₃`) and a rigorous analysis of the stereochemical outcome by applying Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Structures\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material for both reactions is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Its structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`. It contains a carboxylic acid group, an ester group, and a chiral center at the C3 position (the carbon bearing the ethyl group).\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center in the product is at the C4 position, which corresponds to the C3 position of the starting material.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reagents\n*   **`LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **`BH₃` (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Crucial Step)\nThe R/S designation of a chiral center depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups. While the reaction doesn't break bonds at the chiral center, it changes the functional groups at the ends of the molecule, which can alter the CIP priority order and thus potentially change the R/S descriptor.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material:**\n    The groups at the chiral center (C3) are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (acid chain), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester chain).\n    *   The ester chain has a higher priority than the acid chain because the oxygen of the ester's alkoxy group is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the oxygen of the acid's hydroxyl group is attached to hydrogen (C > H).\n    *   **Priority Order:** (1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Lactone Product:**\n    The groups at the chiral center (C4) are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring fragment from carbonyl), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring fragment from ether oxygen).\n    *   The fragment containing the carbonyl has higher priority.\n    *   **Priority Order:** (1) `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > (2) `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > (3) `-Et` > (4) `-H`\n\n### 4. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original P1).\n2.  **Cyclization:** The remaining acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original P2) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, new P1). The reduced ester forms the ether side (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, new P2).\n3.  **Priority Change:** The group that was P1 in the starting material becomes P2 in the product. The group that was P2 becomes P1. The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. A single swap of priorities **inverts** the stereochemical descriptor (R → S, S → R).\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the observed **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**. (S)-A → (R)-lactone.\n\n### 5. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH₃` reduces the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, original P2).\n2.  **Cyclization:** The remaining ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, original P1) forms the carbonyl part of the lactone (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-`, new P1). The reduced acid forms the ether side (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`, new P2).\n3.  **Priority Change:** The group that was P1 in the starting material becomes P1 in the product. The group that was P2 becomes P2. The priority ranking **is preserved**. This means the stereochemical descriptor is **retained** (R → R, S → S).\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the observed **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**. (S)-B → (S)-lactone.\n\n### Final Result\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Therefore, A and B are the same compound.\n\nThis matches the answer provided in option A.

Analyze the Product and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The two reactions produce enantiomers: `(R)` in reaction 1 and `(S)` in reaction 2. A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxyester).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.

Let's assume the principal group is the carboxylic acid, and the other end is the isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu` (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2).\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **`LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated to form a carboxylate (`-COO-`), which is unreactive towards reduction by LiBH4.\n*   **`BH3` (Borane):** This reagent exhibits opposite selectivity. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **3. Trace Reaction 1: A + LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`LiBH4`)-->  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    The intermediate is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.** The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups on the chiral center are H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOR'`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3) > `-H` (P4). The ester group outranks the acid group because the isobutyl carbon beats the acid proton.\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The `-CH2COOR'` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOH` (P1') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2') > `-CH2CH3` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The group that was P2 (`-CH2COOH`) is now P1'. The group that came from P1 (`-CH2COOR'`) is now P2' (`-CH2CH2OH`). The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in priority between two groups attached to a chiral center results in a flip of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will be **(R)**. `(S)-A -> (R)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (R)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(R)-Intermediate -> (R)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **4. Trace Reaction 2: B + BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) remains unchanged.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`  --(`BH3`)-->  `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the delta-lactone (releasing isobutanol).\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry.**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A. Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1) > `-CH2COOH` (P2) > `-CH2CH3` (P3).\n    *   **Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The `-CH2COOH` group has become `-CH2CH2OH`. The groups are now H, Ethyl, `-CH2COOR'`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: `-CH2COOR'` (P1'') > `-CH2CH2OH` (P2'') > `-CH2CH3` (P3''). The ester group still outranks the new alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis of Stereochemical Change:** The priority order of the groups (`-CH2COOR'` > `-CH2CH2OH` > `-CH2CH3`) is maintained relative to the starting material. Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation does not change.\n    *   Therefore, if we start with an **(S)** starting material, the intermediate will also be **(S)**. `(S)-B -> (S)-Intermediate`.\n    *   Lactonization of the (S)-intermediate does not change the stereocenter's configuration. So, `(S)-Intermediate -> (S)-Lactone`.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also requires an understanding of how the reduction products cyclize to form a lactone and how stereochemistry is preserved during this process.\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe name provided is \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break this down to deduce the structure.\n*   \"pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes the substituent at C5. \"oxo\" means a carbonyl group (C=O), and \"isobutoxy\" means an -O-iBu group (where iBu is isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2). Together, -C(=O)O-iBu represents an isobutyl ester group.\n\nSo, the molecule has a 5-carbon main chain. C1 is a carboxylic acid, and C5 is an isobutyl ester.\nThe structure is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(O)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a single stereocenter at the C3 carbon, where the ethyl group is attached. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters much more readily than carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    (A) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(LiBH4)---> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring, a delta-lactone, and eliminates a molecule of water.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) do not occur at the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 (borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than esters.\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.**\n    BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    (B) HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  ---(BH3)---> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.**\n    The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the isobutyl ester. This reaction forms the same six-membered lactone and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol.\n    The resulting lactone is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. The oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)----C(=O)(2)\n     /         \\\n   CH2(6)      CH2(3)\n   |           |\n  CH2(5)------CH(Et)(4)\n```\nThe carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (not drawn), an ethyl group, a -CH2C(=O)- group, and a -CH2CH2O- group. The problem specifies the stereochemistry at this center: (R) for the product from reaction A, and (S) for the product from reaction B.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deconstruct this name. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n     Et\n     |\nHOOC-CH2-CH-CH2-COO-iBu\n 1    2    3   4    5\n```\nThis molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is the carbon bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reducing agent has a special affinity for carboxylic acids. It selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                     Et\n         |                      |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    (Starting Material A)       (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the hydroxyl (-OH) group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group at the other end. This is an intramolecular esterification that forms the six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester at C5 and cyclization involving C1 and the C5-OH) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center (C4 in the lactone, which was C3 in the starting material) must have the (R) configuration. This means starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COO-iBu) untouched.\n    ```\n         Et                      Et\n         |                       |\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu  ->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    (Starting Material B)        (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    ```\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** Under acidic conditions (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the ester carbonyl. This is an intramolecular transesterification that forms the same six-membered lactone ring and eliminates a molecule of isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, these transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center must have the (S) configuration. This means starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center is at C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one):\n        ```\n           O(1) - C(2)=O\n          /      \\\n        C(6)H2    C(3)H2\n        |         |\n        C(5)H2 -- C(4)H(Et)\n        ```\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other is an isobutyl ester. The ethyl group is at the central carbon.\n    *   Structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:\n        ```\n              Et\n              |\n        HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COOiBu\n         1     2    3    4      5\n        ```\n    *   The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe formation of a δ-lactone (6-membered ring) from this starting material implies that one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and then cyclization occurs.\n\n*   **Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1, forming a six-membered lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n            `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`\n        2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        3.  Under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester at C1, forming the same six-membered lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n**Conclusion from Pathways:** Both reaction pathways convert the starting material into the same product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In both cases, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the four groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of these groups, which might change due to the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Starting Acid (at C3):**\n    The four groups attached to C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n    1.  **-CH₂COOiBu** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH, the ester group takes priority because the oxygen of the alkoxy group (-OiBu) is attached to a carbon, while the oxygen of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to a hydrogen. Carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.\n    2.  **-CH₂COOH** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Acid): **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **CIP Priorities for the Product Lactone (at C4):**\n    The four groups attached to C4 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and two fragments of the ring: -CH₂-C(=O)O- (let's call it A') and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (let's call it B').\n    *   Fragment A' is derived from the original -CH₂COOH group.\n    *   Fragment B' is derived from the original -CH₂COOiBu group.\n    1.  **-CH₂-C(=O)O- (A')** (Highest priority, P1): Comparing fragments A' and B', we look down their chains. In A', C4 is attached to C3, which is attached to C2. C2 is part of the C=O group and is bonded to two oxygens. In B', C4 is attached to C5, which is attached to C6. C6 is bonded to only one oxygen. Therefore, A' has higher priority.\n    2.  **-CH₂-CH₂-O- (B')** (P2)\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (P3)\n    4.  **-H** (Lowest priority, P4)\n    Priority Order (Lactone): **-CH₂-C(=O)O- > -CH₂-CH₂-O- > -Et > -H**\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    Let's compare the priorities before and after the reaction:\n    *   The group that was **P1** in the acid (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes fragment B' in the lactone, which is **P2**.\n    *   The group that was **P2** in the acid (-CH₂COOH) becomes fragment A' in the lactone, which is **P1**.\n    The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap between any two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion of the stereochemical configuration** (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ → **(R)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ → **(S)**-lactone\n    Since the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration, the starting material B must have the opposite configuration. Therefore, **B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of cyclic ester is called a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring. According to IUPAC nomenclature for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, and the carbonyl carbon is position 2. Therefore, the ethyl group is at the carbon in the gamma (γ) position relative to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 4 is bonded to four different groups (a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different parts of the ring), making it a chiral center. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of delta-hydroxy carboxylic acids (5-hydroxy carboxylic acids). The precursor for our product must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C-3, which becomes C-4 in the final lactone product. The stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained during this cyclization.\n\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH   --(H+, heat)-->   (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) + H₂O\n    (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)                 (δ-lactone)\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n*   It has two carboxyl-type functional groups: one is a free **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and the other is an **isobutyl ester** (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   It has an ethyl group at position 3, which is the chiral center.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl.\n\nThis starting material has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The key to solving the problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(LiBH₄)-->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a selective reducing agent known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu   --(BH₃)-->   HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction steps do not alter the configuration of the chiral center. The stereochemistry of starting material B is the same as that of the product lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone). The structure is named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with the stereochemistry at the C4 position specified as either (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group at C2, and an ethyl group at the C4 chiral center.\n*   **Formation:** Such a lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid. In this specific case, the open-chain precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-CH₂OH(C5)\n    The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The chiral center in the starting dicarboxylic acid derivative is at C3. After the reaction and cyclization, this C3 becomes the C4 of the lactone. We must track the stereochemistry from C3 of the reactant to C4 of the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1 (A -> Product):** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones but does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2 (B -> Product):** BH₃ (Borane). BH₃ is a selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH₄)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting molecule, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the configuration at the chiral center is retained or inverted. Let's assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, C4 in the product).\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        - Comparing -CH₂COOH and -CH₂COOiBu: The -COOiBu group has higher priority because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in -COOH, the corresponding oxygen is attached to a hydrogen.\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The chiral center C4 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂-C(=O)O- (part of the ring towards C2), and -CH₂CH₂O- (part of the ring towards O1).\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped during the reaction sequence. A swap in priorities of two groups leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Determining A:** The product of Reaction 1 is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction causes an inversion, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH₃)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COOiBu) untouched.\n    B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺), where the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Let's analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        - (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        - (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is attacked during cyclization and becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (group 1 remains group 1, group 2 remains group 2). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration (R remains R, and S remains S).\n4.  **Determining B:** The product of Reaction 2 is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction proceeds with retention, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms.\n*   The carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 (adjacent to the ring oxygen).\n*   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is at position 4.\n*   The stereocenter is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a precursor molecule: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\nThe hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring. The chiral center is at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the resulting lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nAll options propose the same base structure for starting materials A and B: **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\nThe structure is: iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end.\n*   An isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other end.\nThe chiral center is at C3, which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is known to reduce esters more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids (which first deprotonate to form a less reactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the **ester** group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left largely unreacted.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the final lactonization step.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3), its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a classic reagent used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction must also produce the same lactone structure, which means it must also proceed through the **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** intermediate. Let's see how.\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is left untouched. The initial product is isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate (HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu).\n    2.  The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (\"+ H+\"). In this context, the acidic conditions will not only process the borane intermediates but also catalyze the **hydrolysis** of the isobutyl ester back to a carboxylic acid.\n    3.  The hydrolysis of the hydroxy-ester yields **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  This hydroxy-acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, none of the steps in this sequence affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Products and Reactions\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a chiral center at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Formation of the Lactone:** A delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific hydroxy acid required here is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5) --(H+)--> Lactone + H2O`\n    *   The chiral center in the hydroxy acid is at C3. Upon cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry at this center is preserved during lactonization.\n\n### 2. Deduce the Structure of the Starting Material\n\n*   The starting material must be a precursor to 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The reactions involve selective reduction of one of two carbonyl groups. This implies the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid derivative.\n*   The parent acid is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid): `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This molecule has a chiral center at C3.\n*   The options provide the name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is somewhat ambiguous, it clearly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The structure of the starting material (A and B) is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and an isobutyl ester group, separated by a three-carbon chain containing the chiral center.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reducing Agents\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### 4. Analyze Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH4 reduces the ester group of starting material A.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (A) --LiBH4--> HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH (Hydroxy Acid)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** We need to compare the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center before and after the reduction to see if the R/S designation changes.\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The groups at the chiral center are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Acid Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2COOH`, and `-CH2CH2OH`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOH` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in A (`-CH2COOiBu`) becomes the group with Priority 2 in the hydroxy acid (`-CH2CH2OH`).\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in A (`-CH2COOH`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the hydroxy acid.\n    *   This swap in the ranking of the top two priority groups causes an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy acid cyclizes to the lactone. A comparison of the CIP priorities for the chiral center in the hydroxy acid and the final lactone shows that the priority order is preserved. Therefore, the configuration does not change during this step.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The overall transformation is (S)-A → (R)-Hydroxy Acid → (R)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### 5. Analyze Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-Lactone\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group of starting material B.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (B) --BH3--> HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu (Hydroxy Ester)`\n    The reaction does not affect the chiral center (`*`).\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same as A.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2COOH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n    *   **Hydroxy Ester Intermediate:** The groups are -H, -Et, `-CH2CH2OH`, and `-CH2COOiBu`.\n        *   Priorities: P1: `-CH2COOiBu` > P2: `-CH2CH2OH` > P3: `-CH2CH3`\n3.  **Configuration Change:**\n    *   The group that was Priority 1 in B (`-CH2COOiBu`) remains Priority 1 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The group that was Priority 2 in B (`-CH2COOH`) is reduced to `-CH2CH2OH`, which becomes Priority 2 in the hydroxy ester.\n    *   The priority ranking of the groups (P1 > P2 > P3) is **preserved**. Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor does **not** change (R remains R, S remains S).\n4.  **Lactonization Step:** The hydroxy ester cyclizes to the lactone, and this step also preserves the stereochemistry.\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The overall transformation is (S)-B → (S)-Hydroxy Ester → (S)-Lactone. To obtain the observed (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Therefore, A and B are the same compound.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester), also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing O(1), C(2)=O, C(3), C(4)-Et, C(5), C(6).\n    *   This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center in this open-chain precursor is at C3.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). Specifically, it's **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3 and contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe problem involves reducing the starting material, which has two reducible groups, with two different selective reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n    *   The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is preserved.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** BH₃ is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction Pathway:**\n        1.  `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu)` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n        2.  The resulting hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the same lactone product.\n    *   Again, the reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center, preserving its spatial arrangement.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in how the R/S designation changes (or doesn't change) due to the change in chemical groups attached to the chiral center. The R/S designation depends on the priority of the substituents.\n\n**Priorities in the Starting Material (A and B):**\nThe four groups attached to the chiral carbon C3 are:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Highest priority, since the ester carbon is considered bonded to three oxygens, one of which is further attached to a carbon)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Second priority, as the carboxyl carbon is bonded to three oxygens, one of which is attached to hydrogen. C > H)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (Lowest priority)\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n*   `A` → Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) → `(R)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂CH₂OH` and `-CH₂COOH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOH` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group becomes the new Priority 2 group, and the original Priority 2 group becomes the new Priority 1 group. The priorities of the top two substituents are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion of the R/S designation**.\n*   Therefore, to obtain an `(R)`-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   `(S)`-A → `(R)`-Intermediate → `(R)`-Lactone\n\n**Analysis for Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n*   `B` → Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) → `(S)`-lactone\n*   The original groups `-CH₂COOiBu` (Priority 1) and `-CH₂COOH` (Priority 2) are transformed into `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH` respectively.\n*   **Priorities in the intermediate:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (New Priority 1)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (New Priority 2)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Conclusion:** The original Priority 1 group remains the new Priority 1 group. The group derived from the original Priority 2 becomes the new Priority 2. The priority order of the main substituents is **retained**. This means there is **no change in the R/S designation**.\n*   Therefore, to obtain an `(S)`-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the `(S)` configuration.\n    *   `(S)`-B → `(S)`-Intermediate → `(S)`-Lactone\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 (next to the oxygen, which is at position 1).\n*   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at position 4.\nThis structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone). Lactones are cyclic esters formed from the intramolecular reaction of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\n\nLet's deduce the structure of the open-chain precursor. Breaking the ester bond of the lactone gives 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The stereocenter at C4 of the lactone corresponds to the stereocenter at C3 of this hydroxy acid.\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It does not readily reduce carboxylic acids or, more accurately, their carboxylate salts which form in the basic medium of the hydride reagent.\n*   **Pathway:** To form the required precursor, (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, the reaction must start with a molecule that has a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The LiBH₄ must reduce the ester to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) intact.\n*   **Deduce Starting Material A:** Let's look at the structure provided in the options: \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the IUPAC name is non-standard, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-isobutyl.\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1.\n    *   The isobutyl ester is at C5.\n    *   The stereocenter is at C3.\n    When this compound (A) is treated with LiBH₄, the ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, while the carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    This product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which is the correct precursor.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of A:** The reduction and subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority of the groups around the chiral center does not change. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent with the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Product:** The product is the (S)-enantiomer of the lactone from Reaction 1. This implies that the starting material B should be the (S)-enantiomer of A.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry of B:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Acknowledge the Mechanistic Discrepancy (for completeness)**\n\nThere is a known inconsistency in the problem statement regarding Reaction 2.\n*   If we take B = (S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu and react it with BH₃, the carboxylic acid at C1 would be reduced.\n*   This would yield HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (isobutyl 6-hydroxy-4-ethylhexanoate).\n*   Upon acidic workup, this intermediate would cyclize to form a 7-membered lactone (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered δ-lactone stated in the problem.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, it's highly probable that this is a flaw in the question's design. The intended logic is for the student to use the known selectivity of the reagents and the principle of stereochemical retention to match the starting materials to the products.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of Reaction 1 and the stereochemical relationship between the products of the two reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product for both reactions, after workup, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is non-standard, it clearly describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nLet's draw the structure and number the carbon chain:\n\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n  1    2     3     4       5\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at C1.\n*   An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-iBu) at C5.\n\nThe molecule also has a chiral center at C3, where the ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids under normal conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters as well, but much more slowly than carboxylic acids.\n\nTherefore, the two reactions will selectively reduce opposite ends of the starting molecule.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (This is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1) in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This closes the ring to form a six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at C1 and C5, which are not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry at C3 is preserved. The chiral center at C3 in the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. The configuration ((R) or (S)) does not change.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The product of this reaction is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be the (R) enantiomer**.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (This is a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) from the reduced C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester (C5) in an intramolecular transesterification reaction. Isobutanol (iBu-OH) is eliminated, and the ring closes to form the same six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: Similar to the first reaction, the reactions occur away from the chiral center (C3). The configuration is preserved. The C3 stereocenter of the starting material becomes the C4 stereocenter of the product.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The product of this reaction is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be the (S) enantiomer**.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Product**\n\n    1.  **Product Structure**: The product in both reactions is a lactone (cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group. The chiral center is at carbon-4, which has an ethyl group attached. The (R) or (S) designation refers to the stereochemistry at this carbon.\n\n    2.  **Lactone Formation**: Six-membered lactones (δ-lactones) are formed from 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n        Upon cyclization (intramolecular esterification), the chiral center at C-3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C-4 of the lactone. The stereochemical configuration is retained during this step.\n\n    3.  **Starting Material Structure**: The options provided are all named `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name, though slightly unconventional, describes a molecule that is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n        The structure is:\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n        This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a chiral center at carbon-3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n    1.  **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n        *   **Reagent**: LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more reactive than NaBH4 but less so than LiAlH4.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n        *   **Reaction Path for A**:\n            a.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n            b.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged (after workup).\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material. Since the product is (R), the starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    2.  **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH3 (Borane)**\n        *   **Reagent**: BH3 (borane) is a highly selective reducing agent.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: BH3 is notable for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both functional groups, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Reaction Path for B**:\n            a.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with BH3.\n            b.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic ester (lactone). The final product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry of the product is dictated by the starting material. Since the product is (S), the starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n    *   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The structure is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. It has an ethyl group at position 4, and the stereocenter at this position has the (R) configuration. Such a lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid, specifically (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of Product 1, with the stereocenter at position 4 having the (S) configuration. It is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone.\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones to alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is generally unreactive towards esters.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are all mono-isobutyl esters of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). This molecule has two different carboxylic acid functional groups that can be modified. One end can be a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other can be an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nThe parent diacid is HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(5). The chiral center is at C3.\n\nFor the reaction to produce a 6-membered lactone (a pyranone ring), the starting material must be a derivative of a 5-hydroxypentanoic acid. Let's analyze the structure of the starting material. The name in the options, \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid,\" although non-standard, implies a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at C1 and an isobutyl ester at C5.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-iBu(5)**\n\nLet's see if this structure works for both reactions:\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1: Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group at C5, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The product of the reduction is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, which are not the stereocenter (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration at C3.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2: Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group at C1, leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   The product of the reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1, displacing isobutanol and forming the same 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2. This is a saturated cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the carbon at position 4 (C4).\n\nThe lactone is formed by an intramolecular esterification reaction of a 5-hydroxypentanoic acid derivative. The carbon skeleton of the linear precursor must have an ethyl group that corresponds to the C4 position in the product. The precursor is therefore a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n*   This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups:\n    1.  A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at one end.\n    2.  An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-iBu) at the other end.\n*   It has one chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), the carbon bearing the ethyl group. The reactions do not involve this chiral center, so its stereochemistry will be preserved in the product. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). We need to determine its selectivity.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions. The carboxylic acid first reacts with the hydride in an acid-base reaction to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `(Stereoisomer of A)` HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  ---(LiBH₄)-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the existing carboxylic acid group and the newly formed alcohol group to form the δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the non-chiral ester end of the molecule. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A at C3 is the same as the stereochemistry of the product at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane). We need to determine its selectivity.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃:** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. This reaction is much faster than the reduction of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group** to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `(Stereoisomer of B)` HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  ---(BH₃)-->  HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the δ-lactone and releasing isobutanol (iBu-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the non-chiral carboxylic acid end of the molecule. The chiral center at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material B at C3 is the same as the stereochemistry of the product at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n*   **Pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This makes the molecule a cyclic ester, specifically a **lactone**.\n*   **delta-Lactone**: Because it's a six-membered ring lactone, it is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon atom bearing the ethyl group.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O=C(2)---C(3)H2\n       /         \\\n     O(1)         C(4)H-Et\n       \\         /\n      C(6)H2---C(5)H2\n```\nThis delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a **delta-hydroxy acid** (a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n\nLet's determine the structure of the open-chain hydroxy acid precursor by conceptually breaking the ester bond (O1-C2). The C2 carbonyl becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the O1 atom (which is attached to C6) becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nThe resulting open-chain precursor is:\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH**\n\nThis molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this acid corresponds to the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter's configuration.\n\nTherefore:\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Although the IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is converted into an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n**HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThis starting material has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COO-iBu)\n\nThe reactions use two different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids**. It reduces them much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) of starting material A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) protonates any intermediates and catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and do not involve the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of starting material B is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COO-iBu) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe name \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group in a position that forms a cyclic ester (lactone). Specifically, this is a δ-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the specific precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)** --- (cyclization) ---> **(4-ethyl)-lactone**\n\nCrucially, the cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center (C3 in the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore:\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (R)-lactone.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options describe the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is best interpreted as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The most plausible structure that fits the name and reactions is:\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)**\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n        **A** (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) --- (LiBH₄) ---> **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH**\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes (with acid catalysis, H⁺) to form the 6-membered δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center. The cyclization also does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must have been the (R)-hydroxyacid, which in turn must have come from starting material **A** with the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options (A) and (D).\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the reduction process does not involve the chiral center, so its configuration should be conserved. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Note:** There is a discrepancy in the problem statement for this reaction. The reduction of the carboxylic acid in B would yield `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. Cyclization of this molecule would form a 7-membered ring (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered ring (δ-lactone) specified. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is most likely an error in the problem's text. The most reliable line of reasoning is to follow the conservation of stereochemistry, which is a fundamental principle. The transformation from an (S) starting material to an (S) product is stereochemically sound.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to yield the (R)-product.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to yield the (S)-product.\n\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, when reacting with a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the chiral center is not involved in the reaction.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (from options):** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It has a carboxylic acid group at one end (C1), an ester group at the other end (C5), and a chiral center at C3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    *   The chiral center is C3.\n\n*   **Product:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone).\n    *   The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the C4 in the lactone ring. The ethyl group is attached to this chiral center.\n    *   Lactonization occurs by forming an ester linkage between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group at C5 and the carbonyl carbon at C1 of a pentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH₄. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, **LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the ester group** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is typically deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with LiBH₄. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and isobutanol is released. The carboxylic acid at C1 remains (or is reformed during workup).\n        A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the lactone) are not broken. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it is **very slow to react with esters**.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** Starting material B (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) reacts with BH₃. The carboxylic acid at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester at C5 remains intact.\n        B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification of the resulting 5-hydroxy ester. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the bond-forming/breaking steps. Its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By IUPAC convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, so the carbonyl carbon is adjacent to it.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid.\n\nLet's draw the product and number the ring atoms according to IUPAC rules:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\n C(6)H2  C(2)=O\n |       |\nC(5)H2  C(3)H2\n \\      /\n   C(4)H-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are all stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon carboxylic acid chain.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The carboxyl group at C1 is a free acid (-COOH), while the carboxyl group at C5 has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2).\n\nThe structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it typically does not reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n    The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1. This is an intramolecular esterification, which forms a stable six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from C5-OH), C5, C4, C3, C2, C1(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. In the IUPAC name of the lactone product, this position is C4. So the product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization involves breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)-configuration**.\n*   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis eliminates options A and C.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: B\n*   **Reagents**: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH3) is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**. (Note: IUPAC naming starts from the ester C1, so the OH is on C5).\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group (originally from C1) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is an intramolecular transesterification, which also forms a six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from the new OH), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone also has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. As established before, this corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product. Thus, this reaction also produces 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)-configuration**.\n*   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products\n\nThe products of the two reactions are stereoisomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nLet's understand the structure of this product. It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"Pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, which is adjacent to the ring oxygen (O1). This confirms it's a lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   \"(R)\" or \"(S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThis lactone is a δ-lactone, which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\nThe chiral center in the acid is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry is preserved during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid cyclizes to form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is a bit unconventional, it describes a molecule derived from 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has formed an ester with isobutanol.\n\nThe structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu (where iBu = isobutyl group, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An ester (-COOiBu)\n\nThe chiral center is at the C3 position (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nNow, let's analyze the reagents and their selectivity. This is the crucial part of the problem.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group remains mostly untouched under typical conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2: BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly, while it reacts much more slowly with esters.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce Starting Material A for Reaction 1\n\n**Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  ⟶  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the ester carbonyl carbon, which is not the chiral center. Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-acid (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) cyclizes under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This means the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Deduce Starting Material B for Reaction 2\n\n**Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  ⟶  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at the carboxylic acid carbon, which is not the chiral center. The configuration of the chiral center (C3) is retained.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate) undergoes intramolecular transesterification under acidic conditions (H⁺ workup) to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n4.  **Connecting to the product:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-ester must have the (S) configuration. This means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nTherefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position.\n*   The combination of these features describes a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n*   The molecule has a single chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n  H2C   C=O\n /   \\ /\nH2C--CH-CH2CH3\n   \\ /\n    CH2\n   (C4 has the chiral center)\n```\n*   Reaction 1 yields the `(R)` enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the `(S)` enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Immediate Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. To find the precursor, we can conceptually hydrolyze the lactone by breaking the ester bond within the ring. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) group to one end and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to the other.\n\nCleavage of the C2-O1 bond results in `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`:\n`HO-CH2(5)-CH2(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nThe chiral center of this precursor acid is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the lactone product. The lactonization process does not change the stereochemistry at this chiral center.\n*   To form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   To form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, we need `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Let's break down the structure:\n*   **Main chain:** pentanoic acid with a free COOH group at C1.\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at C3 and an isobutoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5.\nThe structure is: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThis molecule possesses both an ester functional group and a carboxylic acid functional group. The chiral center is at C3, which will be preserved throughout the reactions.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent. We must consider its chemoselectivity.\n*   **Selectivity:** `LiBH4` readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. In a molecule containing both functional groups, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) in compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    4.  This resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization (`H+` workup) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, to obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`) is another reducing agent.\n*   **Selectivity:** `BH3` is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. In a molecule with both groups, `BH3` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound B is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` is converted to `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter is not affected by this sequence. To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n*   Starting material B = `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a tetrahydropyran skeleton) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position. This is a cyclic ester, specifically a δ-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   This C4 carbon, being attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, and two different paths around the ring), is a chiral center.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nSix-membered (δ) lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids.\nThe structure of our lactone product implies its precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n`HO-CH₂(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone has the ethyl group at C4 (which corresponds to C3 of the acid precursor). The stereochemistry at this chiral center is not altered during the lactonization process. Therefore, an (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone, and an (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide isomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at the end of a five-carbon chain. Let's number the chain C1 to C5, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon.\n    `C(5)-C(4)-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)OOH`\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy`: This indicates that C5 has both an oxo (`=O`) and an isobutoxy (`-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) group. This combination describes an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`).\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is a pentanedioic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other (C5).\n\nStarting Material Structure: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)` (where the numbers in parentheses denote the position relative to the carboxylic acid C1). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutoxy part becomes isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged (as a lithium carboxylate salt).\n    3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) protonates the carboxylate back to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction produces `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the stereocenter at C3, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-CH₂OH(1)`.\n    4.  Under the reaction conditions (or during acidic workup), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** The attacking `OH` is on C1 (now `CH₂OH`) and the ester is at C5. This also results in the formation of the same `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` system which cyclizes. Let's trace the ring formation more carefully: the intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. The `OH` at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center at C3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   The product in both reactions is a derivative of \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom.\n*   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"-2-one\" means there is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. By convention, the oxygen atom in the ring is at position 1. This structure is a cyclic ester, specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   This C4 atom is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the carbon chain forming the ring.\n*   The product of Reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of Reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options suggest the starting material is \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   Let's decode this name. It's a derivative of pentanedioic acid (also known as glutaric acid), which has the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH.\n*   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group is on the central carbon (C3). The structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH.\n*   This C3 is a chiral center because it's attached to H, Et, -CH₂COOH, and another group. Let's see what that is.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\": This is a slightly non-standard name indicating that one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂). Numbering the pentanedioic acid chain from 1 to 5, the structure is a monoester:\n    HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOiBu(5)\n*   The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are: H, Ethyl, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Since these four groups are different, C3 is indeed a chiral center. The starting materials A and B are the (R) or (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagents**\n\n*   Both reactions involve a reduction followed by an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone ring. To form this ring, a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative) is needed as an intermediate.\n*   **Reaction 1 Reagent: LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**. LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. In the presence of both an ester and a carboxylic acid, it preferentially reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Reaction 2 Reagent: BH₃ (Borane)**. BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while it does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1 (with LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy acid. Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water and forming the 6-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, no bonds to the chiral center (C3, which becomes C4 in the product) are broken or formed. Thus, the absolute 3D arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is retained.\n*   **However, the R/S designation might change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituent groups changes.** Let's analyze this critical point.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups at C3 are H, Et, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Comparing -CH₂COOH and -CH₂COOiBu, the ester group has higher priority because the O is attached to a carbon (in iBu) while in the acid it's attached to H. So the priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** The groups at C4 are H, Et, -CH₂-C(=O)O- (from the original acid), and -CH₂-CH₂-O- (from the original ester). Comparing the two ring segments, the C next to the carbonyl is attached to three oxygens (by convention), while the C next to the ether oxygen is attached to one oxygen and two hydrogens. So the priority order is: (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂-CH₂-O- > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Starting Material Group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes Product Group 2.\n        *   Starting Material Group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes Product Group 1.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. This causes an **inversion of the R/S descriptor**. An (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces **(R)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material **A must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2 (with BH₃)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (B):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 1: Reduction.** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu → (R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization.** The intermediate is a 5-hydroxy ester. Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) and forming the lactone. This is an intramolecular transesterification.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the 3D arrangement at the chiral center is retained. Let's check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂-CH₂-O- > (3) Et > (4) H.\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Starting Material Group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes Product Group 1 (-CH₂-C(=O)O-).\n        *   Starting Material Group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes Product Group 2 (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   The priorities of the groups are **maintained**. This means the **R/S descriptor is retained**. An (S) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces **(S)**-lactone. Therefore, the starting material **B must also be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **pyran-2-one**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at position 2, forming a lactone (a cyclic ester). The oxygen is at position 1.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   The structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the ring.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\nThe precursor to `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\nLet's verify this:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group (-OH) on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) on C1. The resulting ring consists of atoms C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and the oxygen from the C5-OH group. This forms a six-membered ring. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's determine its structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). The carboxyl carbon is C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) is at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes a substituent at C5. It's an isobutoxycarbonyl group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is an isobutyl ester.\n*   Combining these parts, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`.\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a chiral center at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does not readily reduce carboxylic acids (especially after deprotonation to the unreactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The reduction converts starting material A into `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate alkoxide and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction mechanism does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `BH₃` (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 remains largely unreacted under conditions where the acid is selectively reduced.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The problem states that the final product is a 6-membered lactone, which means the final precursor must be `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. To get from the hydroxy-ester intermediate to this hydroxy-acid, the ester group must be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis (`-COOiBu` → `-COOH`) occurs during the acidic workup (H⁺).\n    5.  The resulting `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final (S)-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: None of the steps in this proposed pathway (reduction of C1, hydrolysis of C5, lactonization) affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**: This describes a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring). It's saturated (tetrahydro). There's a carbonyl group (ketone/one) at position 2. This structure is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The IUPAC numbering for lactones starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2. So the structure is an O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2 ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The two reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this product.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered delta-lactone, the precursor is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The precursor to our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** (HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH). The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a non-standard IUPAC name, but it most plausibly describes a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (also known as 3-ethylpentanedioic acid).\n*   **Structure**: iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\n*   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOiBu).\n*   It has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting diester-acid into the lactone. This requires reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and then inducing cyclization. The key to solving this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a strong, but selective, reducing agent. In a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the basic hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is much less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it does so much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**4. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: A = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group is mostly unreacted.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The acid workup (H+) protonates the intermediate carboxylate salt, yielding the hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This molecule then cyclizes (lactonizes), often promoted by the acidic conditions, to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: These reaction steps (reduction of a group away from the chiral center, lactonization) do not affect the stereochemistry at the C3 position. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A must be the (R)-enantiomer**.\n\n**5. Trace the Pathway for Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Starting Material**: B = `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**: BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group is left intact.\n*   **Step 2 (Workup & Cyclization)**: The intermediate after reduction is a hydroxy-ester: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`. During the workup or upon heating, this molecule undergoes an intramolecular transesterification: the terminal -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in the first reaction, these steps do not affect the existing chiral center. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position, making it a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **\"tetrahydro-\"**: The ring is saturated.\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   The C4 carbon, bearing the ethyl group, is a chiral center. The products are the specific enantiomers, (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\nLet's draw the general structure of the product:\n```\n      O        // The O is position 1, the C=O is C2\n     / \\\n  C(=O) CH2\n  /     \\\n CH2      CH-CH2CH3   // This is C4, the chiral center\n  \\     /\n   CH2\n```\nThe chirality at C4 determines if it's the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's decode this name to understand its structure.\n*   **\"pentanoic acid\"**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **\"3-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group at C3. This C3 is a chiral center.\n*   **\"5-oxo\" and \"5-isobutoxy\"**: This describes the group at C5. Together, they form an isobutyl ester, -C(=O)O-iBu.\nSo, the molecule has a carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other end. It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n\nStructure of the starting material:\n```\n     HOOC - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C(=O)O-iBu\n                 |\n               CH2CH3\n IUPAC numbering: C1   C2   C3    C4     C5\n```\nThe chiral center in the starting material is at C3. This chiral center corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone product. Since the reactions involved (reduction and cyclization) do not affect this stereocenter, the configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be the same as the configuration of the final product.\n\nThe two different reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids react with the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to further reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH₄. It will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction)**:\n    ```\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  --[LiBH₄]-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    ```\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization)**: The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid and catalyzes intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The original chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is preserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4.

Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, which is a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The two products are enantiomers, differing only in their stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe formation of this lactone implies that the starting material, upon selective reduction, yields a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The structure of this precursor must be `HO-(CH₂)₄-COOH` with an ethyl group at the appropriate position.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure and identify its key features:\n`isobutyl-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\nThis molecule has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`).\n*   A single chiral center at C3, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nThe lactone product is formed from an open-chain precursor `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which results from the reduction of either the ester or the carboxylic acid group. The C3 of the starting material corresponds to C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is key to solving the problem.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe outcome of each reaction depends on the selective action of the reducing agent:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much more rapidly than it reduces esters.\n\n### **4. Trace the Path of Each Reaction**\n\n#### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    `A (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the newly formed hydroxyl group (at C5) and the existing carboxylic acid group (at C1), forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the R/S configuration changes. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: `-CH₂-COOR` beats `-CH₂-COOH` because the isobutyl group is larger than H).*\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** After reduction and cyclization, the chiral center C4 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: The path `-CH₂-C(=O)-` has higher priority than `-CH₂-CH₂O-` because C is attached to (O,O,O) vs (O,H,H)).*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product, and the group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 1. This swapping of the top two priorities leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → S, S → R).\n    *   Since the product is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n    `B (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same priorities as for A.\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** The groups attached to the chiral center are the same as in Reaction 1, with the same priorities.\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material (`-CH₂-COOR`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`). The group that was Priority 2 (`-CH₂-COOH`) becomes Priority 2 (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). The relative priority order is unchanged. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → R, S → S).\n    *   Since the product is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n*   **Reaction 1:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reaction 2:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\nThe lactone product is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered lactone, this would be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (for reaction 1) or a hydroxy-ester that cyclizes via transesterification (for reaction 2).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The main chain has 5 carbons.\n*   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   The structure is: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(C5-C4)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)`\n*   The chiral center is C3, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents (Reducing Agents)**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. In the context of our starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group.\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `No reaction (or very slow)`\n\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has a different selectivity profile. It is excellent for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and does so faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `No reaction (or slow)`\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1: Starting Material A to (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n    *   Starting material A (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with LiBH₄.\n    *   The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup protonates the carboxylic acid, making it more electrophilic. The hydroxyl group at C5 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1), forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   This intramolecular esterification produces the lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) changes.\n    *   **In Starting Material (A):** The groups on C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. So, Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The acid group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Acid > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** During the reduction, the group that was priority #1 (ester) became priority #2 (alcohol), and the group that was priority #2 (acid) became priority #1. When the priorities of two groups on a chiral center are swapped, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) inverts.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2: Starting Material B to (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with BH₃**\n    *   Starting material B (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with BH₃.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester. Isobutanol is eliminated, forming the same lactone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In Starting Material (B):** Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Ester > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** In this reaction, the original priority #1 group (ester) remains #1. The original priority #2 group (acid) becomes the new priority #2 group (alcohol). The overall priority ranking of the four substituents **does not change**.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   To get an **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material to produce the respective products.\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires understanding the selectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) and Borane (`BH3`), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring containing `O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-`.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n    *   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other.\n    *   It has a chiral center at position 3, the carbon with the ethyl group. This chiral center will become position 4 in the final lactone product. The reactions described (reduction and cyclization) do not alter the stereochemistry at this center.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n1.  **Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`)**: This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It can reduce aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**, but it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n2.  **Borane (`BH3`)**: This reducing agent has a unique and high selectivity for **carboxylic acids**, reducing them to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters, especially in the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`LiBH4`)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n2.  **Cyclization (Lactonization):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid undergoes an intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group (`-OH`) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon to form the stable six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (A) must be the same as the stereochemistry of the product. Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-product**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) untouched.\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`BH3`)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n2.  **Cyclization (Transesterification):** In the presence of acid (`H+`), the resulting 5-hydroxy ester undergoes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl carbon, displacing the isobutoxy group (`-OiBu`) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material (B) must match that of the product. Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selectivity of different reducing agents and the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product and starting materials**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). It has a single stereocenter at the 4-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options provided are all stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It has a single stereocenter at the 3-position, where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will *not* reduce the -COOH group but *will* reduce the -COOiBu group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C-5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C-1 remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  ---(LiBH₄)-->  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the C-3 stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration of the starting material at C-3 is retained in the final product at C-4.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a reducing agent. It is known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will *not* reduce the -COOiBu group but *will* reduce the -COOH group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C-1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester at C-5 remains unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  ---(BH₃)-->  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter at C-3. The configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and choose the correct option**\n\n*   From our analysis, starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A = (S)... , B = (S)...\nB) A = (R)... , B = (S)...\nC) A = (R)... , B = (R)...\nD) A = (S)... , B = (R)...\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a single chiral center at position 4, which has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of the first product, with an (S) configuration at the chiral center.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid. To form a six-membered ring lactone, the precursor must be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options provided are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n*   The parent chain is a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end.\n*   At the other end (position 5), there is an \"isobutoxy-oxo\" group, which describes an isobutyl ester group: -C(=O)O-iBu.\n*   There is an ethyl group at position 3.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\nLet's draw the structure:\nHOOC(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(Et)(3) - CH₂(4) - C(=O)O-iBu(5)\n\nThis molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is specified as either (R) or (S) in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThis problem hinges on the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester group**.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\nNow, let's trace the two reaction pathways.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (A):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  →  (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The intermediate is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (B):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  →  (R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4.

Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The name indicates an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 position is a chiral center, and the products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Formation of a Delta-Lactone:** A delta-lactone is typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of this precursor would be HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). The hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at position 3.\n    *   It is a mono-ester. One carboxylic acid group is free, while the other is an isobutyl ester. By IUPAC naming conventions for acids, the free carboxylic acid carbon is C1.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   The key feature of this starting material is that it has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities.\n\n**Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in the given starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + isobutanol\n    The product of the reduction is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction A:** The product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material A must have had the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product of this reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing the isobutanol and forming the same six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemistry happens at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is retained.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The intermediate is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n        c. The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid on C1 to form the 6-membered delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction of ester, lactonization) do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone product.

The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group on C1 attacks the ester carbonyl carbon C5, and isobutanol is eliminated.\n        d. The atoms forming the ring are: the oxygen from the C1-alcohol, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 (the carbonyl carbon). This forms a 6-membered ring, which is the required delta-lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: These reactions also do not involve the chiral center at C3. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.

This is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms. The IUPAC name indicates the oxygen is at position 1, the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2, and an ethyl group is at position 4. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n    ```\n        CH2(6)--CH2(5)\n       /          \\\n      O(1)        *CH(Et)(4)\n       \\          /\n        C(2)(=O)--CH2(3)\n    ```\n    *   This lactone is formed from a linear 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid through intramolecular esterification (lactonization).\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n    *   Note that the chiral carbon C3 in the open-chain acid becomes the chiral carbon C4 in the lactone. The reaction does not involve bond changes at this chiral center, so the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) is retained.\n\n*   **Starting Materials (Options):** The options propose stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two different carboxyl-derived functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It is a mono-ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n    The chiral center is at C3.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It reduces esters faster than carboxylic acids. In the presence of a carboxylic acid, it first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is then resistant to reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is deprotonated.\n        `A (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`LiBH4`---> `Li⁺ ⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to give the carboxylic acid.\n        `⁻OOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` ---`H⁺`---> `HOOC-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid)\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a powerful reducing agent, particularly known for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester group at C5 intact.\n        `B (HOOC...-COOiBu)` ---`BH3`---> `HOCH2-CH2-CH*(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) is used to process the intermediate borate esters and also catalyzes the intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5 of the carbon chain. The chiral center at C3 is not affected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the pair of compounds listed in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group (a δ-lactone or oxan-2-one). The stereocenter is at position 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 produces the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Reaction 2 produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are enantiomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". While the name is slightly ambiguous, the most chemically sensible structure for this name is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   It has a single stereocenter at carbon-3, the one bearing the ethyl group. This stereocenter is what determines if the starting material is (R) or (S). This C3 in the starting material will become the C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + `LiBH₄` + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group `(-COOiBu)` to a primary alcohol `(-CH₂OH)`. The carboxylic acid group `(-COOH)` remains largely unaffected.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `LiBH₄`.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered ring.\n    4.  The final product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry for Reaction 1:** We need to determine if the configuration at the stereocenter is retained or inverted. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   **At C3 of the Starting Material:** The substituents are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), `-CH₂COOH` (Group 1), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (Group 2).\n        *   Comparing Group 1 and Group 2, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) because the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (in isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen. So, Priority: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **At C4 of the Product Lactone:** The substituents are -H, -Et, `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (ring portion, from the original acid), and `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (ring portion, from the original ester).\n        *   Comparing the ring portions, the one containing the carbonyl group has higher priority. So, Priority: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` > `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` > `-Et` > `-H`.\n    *   **Comparing Priorities:**\n        *   The group with the highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes the group with the second-highest priority in the product (`-CH₂CH₂O-`).\n        *   The group with the second-highest priority in the starting material (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the group with the highest priority in the product (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`).\n    *   Since the priorities of the top two groups are swapped, the stereochemical configuration is **inverted**.

It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu` is treated with `BH₃`.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`.\n    3.

Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same compound. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The product name is `(R)-` or `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n*   **Pyran**: Indicates a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **-2-one**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Numbering in such heterocycles starts with the oxygen as position 1 and proceeds towards the carbonyl group.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring. This is the chiral center.\n*   **(R)/(S)**: Specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. Such lactones are typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Let's determine the open-chain precursor.\n\nBreaking the ester bond (O1-C2) of the lactone gives the hydroxy acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\nLet's name this precursor acid. The main chain has 5 carbons with a carboxylic acid group, so it is a pentanoic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxylic carbon (C1).\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\nThe name is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nWhen this hydroxy acid cyclizes, the C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone is directly inherited from the hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will form `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an acid-ester:\n`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\nNumbering from the free acid group (C1):\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a reducing agent that is known for its chemoselectivity. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones but **does not reduce carboxylic acids** (or their conjugate bases, carboxylates).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the **ester** group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The reduction at C5 does not affect the chiral center at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of starting material A is passed on to the hydroxy acid intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** To obtain the `(R)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must be `(R)`. This requires the starting material A to have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis finding eliminates options B and D.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH3`, often used as `BH3-THF`) is also a reducing agent, but with a different selectivity compared to `LiBH4`. `BH3` selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH3` will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The reduction at C1 does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of B is passed on to the hydroxy ester intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H+`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, causing cyclization to form the same lactone structure and release isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** To obtain the `(S)`-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must be `(S)`. This requires the starting material B to have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material Options:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has a chiral center at carbon-3.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu).\n    *   The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (`-CH(Et)-`). The reactions happen at the ends of the molecule, so the stereochemistry at this carbon is expected to be retained throughout the reaction sequence. However, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) designation (R or S) may change if the relative priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n    *   The lactone is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The `-OH` group at C-5 reacts with the `-COOH` group at C-1 to form the six-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C-4, which corresponds to C-3 in the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nBoth reactions involve a selective reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups, followed by an acid-catalyzed cyclization (lactonization).\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Reagent is **LiBH₄** (Lithium borohydride).\n    *   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids (which react much more slowly).\n    *   So, `LiBH₄` will reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Reagent is **BH₃** (Borane).\n    *   `BH₃` is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    *   So, `BH₃` will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and CIP Priority Changes**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the reactions affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, which determines the R/S designation.\n\n1.  **Priorities in the Starting Material (SM):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH (Acid chain), and -CH₂COO-iBu (Ester chain).\n    *   By CIP rules, H is priority 4. Comparing the other three groups:\n        *   The ester chain (-CH₂COO-iBu) has higher priority than the acid chain (-CH₂COOH).\n        *   Both the ester and acid chains have higher priority than the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   So, the priority order is: **P1: -CH₂COO-iBu > P2: -CH₂COOH > P3: -Et > P4: H**.\n\n2.  **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C4) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the carbonyl side of the ring (-CH₂-C=O), and the ether side of the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   By CIP rules, the priority order is: **New P1: -CH₂-C=O > New P2: -CH₂-CH₂-O- > New P3: -Et > New P4: H**.\n\n3.  **Trace the Priority Changes for Each Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The two highest priority groups have swapped their priority labels (Old P1 → New P2, Old P2 → New P1). A single swap of priorities inverts the stereochemical designation.\n        *   Therefore, an (S)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (R)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(R)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The priority labels are maintained (Old P1 → New P1, Old P2 → New P2). There is no swap.\n        *   Therefore, the stereochemical designation is retained. An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(S)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Product Structure\n\nBoth reactions produce an enantiomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   **\"pyran\"**: Indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **\"tetrahydro...-2-one\"**: This specifies a saturated six-membered ring with a carbonyl group at position 2, adjacent to the ring oxygen (position 1). This is a δ-lactone (delta-lactone).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the lactone ring.\n*   The structure is chiral, with the stereocenter at carbon 4.\n\nThe structure of the lactone ring is:\n`O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(5)H2-C(6)H2-`\n\nA lactone is a cyclic ester, typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy carboxylic acid. To form this specific six-membered lactone, the precursor must be a **5-hydroxy acid**. Hydrolysis (breaking the ester bond) of the product gives its hydroxy acid precursor:\n`HO-C(6)H2-C(5)H2-C(4)H(Et)-C(3)H2-C(2)(=O)-OH`\nIf we renumber this as a standard carboxylic acid chain (starting from the -COOH group), it is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\nThe stereocenter in this hydroxy acid is C3. Lactonization does not affect this stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry at C4 of the lactone product directly corresponds to the stereochemistry at C3 of its hydroxy acid precursor.\n*   `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\n\nThe options propose that the starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's interpret this chemical name. It describes a derivative of `pentanoic acid` (a 5-carbon carboxylic acid). The `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy` substituents describe an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at the end of the chain.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Let's draw the structure, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`\n*   This molecule is chiral at C3 because the two groups attached to it (`-CH2COOH` and `-CH2COOiBu`) are different.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the given reducing agents react with this starting material.\n\n**Reaction A: Treatment with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is effective at reducing esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It is much less reactive towards carboxylates (the deprotonated form of carboxylic acids). Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the **ester** group.\n*   **Reaction:** `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`. This is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C5 (the ester) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction A:**\n    *   Starting Material `A` reacts with `LiBH₄` to produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `A` must be the **(R)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**Reaction B: Treatment with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   `BH₃` is a reducing agent that has a strong and well-known selectivity for reducing **carboxylic acids** in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction:** `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n*   **Intermediate:** `HOCH₂(from C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(=O)-O-isobutyl`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl group, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone. Let's trace the ring formation: the oxygen from the original C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon C5. This forms a ring containing O(from C1), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 - a six-membered ring.\n*   **Resulting Lactone Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the same structural skeleton as in Reaction A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at C1 (the acid) which is not the stereocenter. The stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction B:**\n    *   Starting Material `B` reacts with `BH₃` to produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   This implies that `B` must be the **(S)-enantiomer** of the starting material.\n    *   `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reduction reactions leading to stereoisomeric products. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The full name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This means it's a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    The structure is: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group. This chiral center can have an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a δ-lactone (a 6-membered cyclic ester).\n    *   The reaction involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) that forms the 6-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. The reaction yields either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  The ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate formed is (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid). Its stereochemistry at C3 is the same as in starting material A.\n        4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1, forming the 6-membered lactone and eliminating a molecule of water.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** BH₃ (borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at C5 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate is (isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate). Its stereochemistry at C3 is the same as in starting material B.\n        4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl group (from C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, forming the same 6-membered lactone via transesterification, eliminating a molecule of isobutanol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules assign the (R)/(S) designation and how this assignment changes (or doesn't) during each reaction.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material (SM):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two main chains, the ester chain has higher priority than the acid chain because at the first point of difference (the oxygen atom), it's bonded to a carbon (of isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-COOR` (P1) > `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Product (Lactone):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (carbonyl side of the lactone ring)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (oxygen side of the lactone ring)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two ring fragments, the one containing the carbonyl group (`-C(=O)`) has higher priority than the one with the single-bonded oxygen (`-CH₂O-`).\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P1') > `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (P2') > `-Et` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n\n*   **Connecting SM to Product:**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The high-priority ester group in A (`-CH₂COOR`, P1) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the low-priority oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`, P2').\n        *   The low-priority acid group in A (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`, P1').\n        *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P2', P2 → P1'). Swapping the priorities of two groups on a chiral center inverts the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain an **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(S) configuration**.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n        *   The high-priority ester group in B (`-CH₂COOR`, P1) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`, P1').\n        *   The low-priority acid group in B (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) is reduced and forms the low-priority oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`, P2').\n        *   The priority order of the groups is **preserved** (P1 → P1', P2 → P2'). Therefore, the R/S designation remains the same.\n        *   To obtain an **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must also have the **(S) configuration**.\n        *   (S)-B → (S)-Lactone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the same compound with the (S) configuration.\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone. Let's deconstruct the product name: \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n*   **\"pyran-2-one\"**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran system) and a ketone (carbonyl group) at the 2-position. When a carbonyl is part of a heterocyclic ring next to the heteroatom, it signifies a lactone (cyclic ester). A six-membered lactone is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **\"tetrahydro\"**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **\"4-ethyl\"**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **\"(R)\" or \"(S)\"**: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the carbon at position 4 (the one bearing the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\nCH2(6)   C(2)=O\n |        |\nCH2(5)   CH2(3)\n \\      /\n  CH(4)-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\nReaction A produces the (R)-enantiomer.\nReaction B produces the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\".\n*   This name, though not strictly IUPAC compliant, describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   Structure of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH. The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (C3).\n*   The starting material is a mono-isobutyl ester of this diacid. This means one of the two carboxylic acid groups has been converted into an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n*   Let's assume the esterification occurred on the carboxylic group further from the ethyl substituent. The structure would be:\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-CH2CH(CH3)2`\n    This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The stereochemistry (R/S) is at the C3 position.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reaction**: A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The ester group of starting material A is reduced by LiBH4 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --LiBH4-->  HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n        The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, eliminating a water molecule and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the final lactone product (C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone).\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B: Reduction with BH3**\n\n*   **Reaction**: B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent**: BH3 (Borane) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group of starting material B is reduced by BH3 to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu  --BH3-->  HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)O-iBu`\n        The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group, displacing the isobutoxy group (which becomes isobutanol) and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the original stereocenter at C3. C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone. The stereochemistry is conserved.\n*   **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Products:** Both reactions produce a chiral lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The products are enantiomers of each other:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    \"Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (a δ-lactone). The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4 of the ring. This C4 atom is the stereocenter.\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting materials are enantiomers of a compound named \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name.\n    *   This name is best interpreted as a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   Specifically, it's the mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is: `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. (where `iBu` is isobutyl, `(CH₃)₂CHCH₂-`).\n    *   This molecule possesses two different functional groups: an **ester** (`-COO-iBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`).\n    *   Crucially, the carbon at position 3, which bears the ethyl group, is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COO-iBu.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent with specific selectivity. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but typically **does not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material `A` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` --(LiBH₄)--> `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    2.  The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n    3.  In the presence of acid (H⁺ from workup), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the stable 6-membered δ-lactone. The hydroxyl group at one end of the molecule attacks the carboxylic acid at the other end.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The chiral center in the starting material (C3 of the chain) is not directly involved in the reduction or the cyclization. No bonds to this chiral center are made or broken.\n    *   During cyclization, the C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   Since the chiral center is unaffected, its stereochemical configuration is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material `A` must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but **does not** readily reduce esters. This selectivity is complementary to LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material `B` into a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).

Under acidic conditions (H⁺), this molecule undergoes intramolecular transesterification.

Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions yield a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom. \"-2-one\" means there's a carbonyl group at the C2 position (next to the ring oxygen, O1). \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group at position C4.\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a stereocenter. The product of reaction 1 has the (R) configuration, and the product of reaction 2 has the (S) configuration.\n\nThis lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a specific hydroxy acid. By mentally opening the ester bond, we can identify this precursor: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n    HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH  <-- (H+ catalysis) --> (4-ethyl)-lactone + H2O\n```\n\nNotice that the stereocenter in the hydroxy acid is at C3. During lactonization, this carbon becomes C4 in the lactone. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nOur goal is to figure out how starting materials A and B are converted into this key hydroxy acid intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This is a monoester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   The structure has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is on C3.\n*   Structure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂**\n*   The stereocenter is at C3, the same carbon that will become the stereocenter in the final product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  This transformation yields **HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH**, which is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. This is the exact precursor needed for the lactone.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The entire reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of starting material A is the same as the stereochemistry of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is also a reducing agent, but its selectivity is opposite to that of LiBH₄. BH₃ selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 will remain unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate after reduction is **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) has two functions here. First, it protonates the intermediates from the borane reduction. Second, under aqueous acidic conditions, it will also hydrolyze the remaining isobutyl ester group back into a carboxylic acid.\n    5.  Hydrolysis of the intermediate gives **HOCH₂(at C1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COOH(at C5)**. This molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**, the same key precursor as in Reaction 1.\n    6.  The H⁺ also catalyzes the final cyclization to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the stereocenter is not affected by any of the reaction steps. The configuration is retained from the start to the end.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** Both reactions produce 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). This molecule has a single stereocenter at the C4 position, where the ethyl group is attached. The two reactions yield the two possible enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy acids (or hydroxy esters). A six-membered ring lactone (delta-lactone) like this one is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivative. Specifically, the precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or an ester thereof). The stereocenter in this precursor is at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), which becomes C4 in the lactone. The cyclization step itself does not alter the configuration of the stereocenter. Therefore:\n    *   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n    *   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (or its derivatives).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options for starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's draw this structure. The name indicates a pentanoic acid backbone with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at C1, and an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C5. There is an ethyl group at the C3 stereocenter.\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)\n*   This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester. It has two different carbonyl functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters and aldehydes/ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. In our starting material, LiBH₄ will preferentially reduce the **ester group** at C5 to a primary alcohol.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The reduction doesn't break any bonds at the C3 stereocenter, so its absolute 3D arrangement is preserved.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    5.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:** This is the crucial part. We need to see if the stereochemical descriptor (R or S) changes during the transformation from starting material A to the intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material A (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid):** The four groups attached to the C3 stereocenter are H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. Using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P3)\n        4.  `H` (P4)\n        (The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is bonded to a carbon, while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. C > H).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOiBu` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups at C3 are now H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (P'1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P'2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P'3)\n        4.  `H` (P'4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** The group that was priority 1 (P1) in the starting material becomes priority 2 (P'2) in the intermediate. The group that was priority 2 (P2) becomes priority 1 (P'1) in the intermediate. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This **inverts** the R/S descriptor. For example, if we start with the (S)-enantiomer of A, the intermediate formed will be the (R)-enantiomer of the hydroxy acid.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction produces the (R)-lactone, it must have come from the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate. To get the (R)-hydroxy acid intermediate, we must start with the **(S)-starting material A**.\n    *   (S)-A ---> (R)-hydroxy acid ---> (R)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **5. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) is left untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  Acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry Analysis:**\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material B:** Same as for A: `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) > `-CH₂COOH` (P2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (P3).\n    *   **Priorities in the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The reduction converts the `-CH₂COOH` group to a `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The groups are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. Let's re-evaluate the priorities:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (P''1)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (P''2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (P''3)\n        4.  `H` (P''4)\n    *   **Change in Descriptor:** Let's compare the priority order of the groups before and after the reaction. The starting material P1 group is still the highest priority group (P''1). The starting material P2 group is reduced, and the resulting group has priority P''2. The P3 group remains P''3. The priority order of the groups does not change (i.e., the group derived from P1 is still higher than the group from P2, which is still higher than the group from P3). Therefore, the R/S descriptor is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction produces the (S)-lactone, it must have come from the (S)-hydroxy ester intermediate. Since the configuration is retained in this reaction, we must start with the **(S)-starting material B**.\n    *   (S)-B ---> (S)-hydroxy ester ---> (S)-lactone.\n    *   **Therefore, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, both starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center (stereocenter) is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group. The reactions produce two different stereoisomers: (R) in the first reaction and (S) in the second.\n\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C -- O\n     /      \\\n    CH2      CH-Et   <-- Chiral center at C4\n    |        |\n    CH2 --- CH2\n    ```\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically a mono-isobutyl ester. The structure for \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is:\n\n    ```\n        O                  O\n       //                 //\n    HO--C--CH2--CH(Et)--CH2--C--O-isobutyl\n                       ^\n                       |\n                  Chiral center\n    ```\n    This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the different reactivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form H₂ gas and a lithium carboxylate salt (-COO⁻ Li⁺), which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** BH₃ is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is the opposite of LiBH₄'s. Borane reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols very rapidly and efficiently. While it can also reduce esters, the reaction is significantly slower than the reduction of carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule containing both functional groups, BH₃ will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Trace the Reaction Pathways and Stereochemistry**\n\nNeither of the reduction steps (converting -COOH or -COOR to -CH₂OH) nor the subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) involves breaking any bonds at the chiral center (the carbon with the ethyl group). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be directly retained in the final lactone product.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreacted (it exists as a carboxylate salt).\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --LiBH₄-->  (Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺`\n    2.  **Workup & Cyclization:** Acid workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylate to form a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. This intermediate then spontaneously cyclizes via intramolecular esterification to form the six-membered lactone.\n        `(Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺  --H⁺-->  [(Stereo)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH]  -->  (Stereo)-lactone`\n    3.  **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereochemistry is retained, for the product to be the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact.\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH  --BH₃-->  (Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (after borane complex is hydrolyzed)\n    2.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic (H⁺) or thermal conditions, the hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The terminal hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n        `(Stereo)-iBu-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH  --H⁺ (cat.)-->  (Stereo)-lactone + iBuOH`\n    3.  **Stereochemistry:** Since the stereochemistry is retained, for the product to be the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, with either (R) or (S) stereochemistry. Let's break down this name:\n*   `pyran`: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   `tetrahydro- ... -2-one`: It is a saturated ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position. This specific structure, a cyclic ester, is called a lactone. Because it's a 6-membered ring, it's a delta-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   `(R)` or `(S)`: This denotes the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid.\nLet's identify the specific hydroxy acid precursor for `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   The lactone ring is O¹-C²(=O)-C³H₂-C⁴H(Et)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₂.\n*   If we conceptually \"open\" the ester bond (between O¹ and C²), we get a carboxylic acid at C² and a hydroxyl group at C⁶.\n*   The open-chain precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`.\n*   Note that the chiral center in the acid is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 chiral center in the lactone. Therefore, cyclization of `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` will yield `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, and the `(S)` acid will yield the `(S)` lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\nLet's decode this name:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at C1.\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center.\n*   `5-isobutoxy-5-oxo`: This describes the group at C5. It's a combination of a carbonyl (`oxo`) and an isobutoxy group, which indicates an isobutyl ester (`-COO-isobutyl`).\nSo, the structure is `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-COO-isobutyl(5)`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n\nThe two reducing agents show different chemoselectivity:\n*   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride): A relatively mild reducing agent that reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. It does **not** typically reduce carboxylic acids because it first deprotonates them to form a very unreactive carboxylate anion.\n*   `BH₃` (Borane): A powerful reducing agent that is particularly effective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It is much more reactive towards carboxylic acids than esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) untouched.\n    *   `A` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOOC...CH(Et)...CH₂OH`\n*   This intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) causes this hydroxy-acid to cyclize into the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material `A` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material `A` must be `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH` at C1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl` at C5) untouched.\n    *   `B` (`HOOC...CH(Et)...COOR`) → `HOCH₂...CH(Et)...COOR`\n*   The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n*   Acid workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed `-OH` group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   Let's verify the ring size. The intermediate is `HO-CH₂¹⁻CH₂²-CH(Et)³-CH₂⁴-C(=O)⁵OR`. The attacking oxygen (from C1) and the carbons C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 form the ring. This is a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction happens at the achiral end of the molecule, and the cyclization does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of the starting material `B` directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. To get the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material `B` must be `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThis problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and Borane (BH3), when reacting with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the products are enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone).\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A or B):** The name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's deduce its structure. It's a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end. At the other end (C5), there is an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu). An ethyl group is attached at C3. This carbon (C3) is a stereocenter.\n    Structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    The stereocenter at C3 is what determines if the molecule is (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Product:** The name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The ethyl group is at position 4. This carbon (C4) is a stereocenter, and it corresponds to the C3 of the starting material.\n    Structure: A six-membered ring with an oxygen atom (O1) and a carbonyl group at the adjacent position (C2). An ethyl group is on C4.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding that the reactions occur at the functional groups (carboxylic acid and ester) but **do not affect the stereocenter**. The C-H and C-C bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material) are not broken or formed. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is directly retained in the product. An (R) starting material will produce an (R) product, and an (S) starting material will produce an (S) product.\n\nNow let's examine each reaction path:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent. When reacting with a molecule that has both a carboxylic acid and an ester, it exhibits selectivity. LiBH₄ is basic and will first deprotonate the acidic carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻`). This carboxylate anion is electron-rich and thus resistant to reduction by the nucleophilic hydride (`H⁻`). The ester group, however, remains electrophilic and is readily reduced by LiBH₄ to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu` (Deprotonation)\n    2.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-COO-iBu + LiBH₄` → `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH` (Ester reduction)\n    3.  `[Li⁺]⁻OOC-R-CH₂OH + H⁺` → `HOOC-R-CH₂OH` (Protonation)\n    This final molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids spontaneously cyclize via intramolecular esterification to form a stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As the reaction does not involve the chiral center, its configuration is retained. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be the **(R)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent highly selective for carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-R-COO-iBu + BH₃` → `HOCH₂-R-COO-iBu` (Carboxylic acid reduction to a primary alcohol)\n    The result is a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The H⁺ in the workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction occurs away from the chiral center, so its configuration is retained. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
